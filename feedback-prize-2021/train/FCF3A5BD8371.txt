Dear principle,

I think every student should be required to perform a community service because it might be fun to help out with other things. Your community needs people to help out with either help little kids clean up litter or do other things to help. You can meet new people and learn new things from doing nice things for your community. Helping other people that need help is nice because they might need help with their kids when they are working or they might need someone to take care of them when they are busy. People appreciate when you help them out with one thing or another. Some communities have a lot of trash all over the place so they also need help with cleaning the community. Anything you do could help out a community that is looking for someone to help out. It will help the community stay nice and klean. So principle i think every student should assigned a community service.

Sincerely, Student
