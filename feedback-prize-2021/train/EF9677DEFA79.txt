I think the teacher should let any students play in any sports or activities in school because the might be better at sports or activities than any other kids. They should at least have a c grade to play in the sports. They should at least have a c grade because they are not to low nor to high. I think just because a student doesn't have a b grade and higher doesn't mean that they cant play in a spot or activities. Maybe they are not that smart but they are trying there best but they might not be able to succeed. Sometimes kids cant improve because they might have problems at home the teachers might not notice.

Maybe even smart kids grades go low and the teachers might not notice.

Maybe they have problems at home.

I think before they not allowing them play activities or ports the teachers talk to them why they have low grades. Maybe the teachers could help them with a problem and help them improve their grades. If the teachers connect and get the confident with the kids they might now what is going on with there grades instead of the teachers saying "you can not participate in an activity of sport."

The teachers could talk with kids and see if they could do anything to help them with their grades and help them improve.
