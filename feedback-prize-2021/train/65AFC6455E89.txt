Cell phones are good things to have I believe the first policy is the best. I say this because cell phones are good, when an emergency happen to or somebody else. This is a true story that I am about to tell so I must warn you that it may get a little gruesome. When I was in the sixth grade my best friend an I were about to graduate and since it was close to the end of the year, and we had no work to do, and it was the beginning of summer. My best friend RELATIVE_NAME and I were racing to get to the concrete court outside but when we were racing RELATIVE_NAME ran into to somebody which made him trip RELATIVE_NAME and when RELATIVE_NAME

tripped he fell on his arm i was still running an then i heard a loud yell coming from the top of some bodies lungs. It was terrace, as I looked back RELATIVE_NAME was on the ground an blood was spilling from his arm and it looked deformed. It looked like a T that had been cut right down the middle. i ran back to him, I didn't know what to do, my mind had went blank of every thing, the only thing i knew was that RELATIVE_NAME was screaming right in front of me. I didn't have a cell phone to call for help. so I ran all the way back to the building but the door was locked so i went the long way eventually i made my way back to a teacher an a ambulance had got to the school and was able to help terrene but after that i was thankful. but if i were able to have a cell phone i would have been able to help terrene by calling the police. or by calling someone that could help. so that is why every time somebody ask me if we should have cell phones or not i say we should.
