when people ask for advice,they sometimes talk to more than one because they try to get different perspective.

When someone ask multiple people opinions to try to make they situation better and look at there situation to try and make it better.

A example of someone giving me advice is a bulling situation and i cant handle it ill ask teachers,friends,and family.

I ask for advice If I need help.

im also someone who gives good advice when I was younger my friend told me that she wanted to kill herself because life was hard.

I told her"I god didn't belive that you could do it he wouldent of put you here and if he dident belive that your not stong then your wrong and god loves you so do i"it was a sad moment but she push though it and now she better than ever.

I say giving advice Is a big thing cause that person is putting that trust on you and for you just to throw it away thats disrspectful.

If someone came to me saying I need your help im goin to do every posable thing that i can do to get them on there feet.
