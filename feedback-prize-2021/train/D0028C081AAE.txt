Dear, MR Principal

Ow dear Mr Principal I think there should be a grope that can help community service for example every student that gets in any trouble should get sentence to community serves for school . We can make this school a better place for all students , and if we do this then the school will be clean and all the bad students that cause trouble will have to clean 1 hour after school depending how they did . "Why don't you give it a try !" it has shown in many news that schools need to be clean and organized and if we do have community service then it will always be clean .

We need to have a better community for these children ,by having a very nice school with community service for all those whom get punished in any way.

From my point of view as a student i think we should have a team that can help with community service in school .For example i have seen schools that have community service for those who are bad students and ,those school turn out looking great , but I have all sow seen schools with garbage and litter everywhere they are not as successful as the schools that do have community service . All I ask is for a better place for our school .

Thank you

From , Student
