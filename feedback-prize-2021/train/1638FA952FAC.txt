We as a people should get rid of the Electoral College, and change it to popularity vote to elect the president. People dont vote for the president but instead vote for state electors, And all together the Electoral College is just not fair for the voters.

When people vote they should vote directly to whom they want president instead of letting state electores vote for whom they want without our vote counting. "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect th president." (Bradford Plumer, Mother Jones) Which is stating that we only vote for representatives of our state, at which vote for they want for president. "Because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 represatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people." (Bradford Plumer, Mother Jones) So the voters really don't get to vote who they want, it's the representatives who vote for the president they want.

"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational... It's hard to say this but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!" (Bradford Plumer, Mother Jones) The electoral college is unfair to the voters and should be taken out of the voting process all together.

Most people would agree and say that the electoral college is unfair to the voters because your vote really dosn't matter it's all up to the state represetative to vote who is president, and thats why the electoral college should not exist.
