Hi,My name is Luke. Today I am here to tell you why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. First I am going to tell you what we do. You will be hired by the UNRRA.We travel over seas taking care of animals such as horses, young cows,and mules.

Now I am going to tell you why I think you should join us. First of all you will be helping other people and its always nice to help somebody out. Also you will have to take care of animals and thats a very nice job. You will be traveling a lot. Now here comes the good part,you will get to see a lot of cool sites that you never seen before! Here are some places you might go and see alot of cool things in, Europe,China,Greece and Venice, Italy. All of these places have cool things you can go to. For example in Greece you can go see Acropolis. You probably would also love taking a grondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city which streets are water!

So these are all my reason why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will be helping people out,you will see alot of cool things. You won't regret it. Please support us and join this program.
