Policy 2:

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm afraid I choose policy 2 because since I am an eighth grader I know how they think; I know that if you let us use cell phones in lunch periods or free time then we will just use them in class if we don't finish our conversation, if we "forgot" to talk to someone, or if we just are bored and want to talk to someone then we will use our phones. We use the second policy now

(except were allowed to bring our phones as long as their turned off), but most of the kids here use their backpacks as cover of put up their books to sneak- a -peek at their texts.

Most children think at this age that talking to their friends is more productive than listening to the boring teacher that is droning on and on about something. I've been in between a rock and a hard place trying before because I would be about to tell my friend tell my friend to put away her phone before someone catches her but then

I would hear the teacher and just zone out and not even get to telling my friend to put her phone away. It would be easier to use the second policy if the students were more focused at something they like.

I'm sure that if the children were into the subject then it would be a different story. I know it is hard to get things that students like but I'm just guessing that there would be less phones out in the classroom if things were different and if the students were not the students here at the school. I know that the teachers work as hard as they can, but do the other students do?
