I am going to try to convince you to become a seagoing cowboy. I belive you should become a seagoing cowboy because this is something that helps out other people. Also, sometimes us people in america can get very selfish and need to do things for other people. And I belive that God would want you to do this.

In the text it states,"The cattle boat trip was the experince of a life time for a small town boy." In paragraph 5 it also states,"Besides helping people I had the experince of seeing Europe and China." Doing this would keep you busy. But in paragraph 8 it says "Luke also had time to have fun on board." This also would be somthing you could do to serve our country.

Doing this would be a very good experince to have. You would have a lot of time to get to know the other people on board. For those reasons and more it would be very good for you to become a seagoing cowboy.
