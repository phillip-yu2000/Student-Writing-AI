If you like to be with animals such as horses than we would sure have a fun time on the SS Charles W. Wooster. We have to help the animals that are being shiped over seas like horses, cattle, and mules.

When we aren't caring for the animals then we are out site seeing or playing games on the boat. In the empty stals the horese, cattle, and mules aren't in we play games like baceball and volleyball they had table tennis tournaments, fencing tournaments, boxing tournaments,

they read, and other games that would help pass the time.

This could be a danger if you aren't careful, one time it was raining and I was on nightwatch then I fell and a strip o melat stoped me from falling overboard. I couldn't work for a couple of days due to cracked ribs from me hitting them of the strip of metal.

But it is not all fun and games so if you like hard word you would love the job of being a Seagoing Cowboy, we have to clean out the stalls the horses and cattle and mules were in and that stinks litterily. We have to carry huge bags of oats and other food for the animals, and boy does my back hurt,whew.

But don't get my wrong this job is fun hangging out with friends. If this job sounds apealing then come on over and help we need it a lot. This job is fun, hard, and worth your time, so please come over.
