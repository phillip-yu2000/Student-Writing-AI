The use of technology to read the expressions of students in a classroom could be very valuable. In class, no matter what grade a student is in or what gender the student is; they often get confused. When confusion takes place some students would rather not ask for help because they may feel ashamed and notfo as smart as their peers for not understanding.

Teachers are human too, however some could know when something is wrong with a student while others on the other hand wouldn't. The technology that could read emotional expressions could see if a student is confused, frustrated or even angry because they aren't understanding the work given to them. The teacher could use the computer software to detect if the student is progressing during instructional time. This could prevent students from failing on exams and getting poor grades on assignments.

Using the computer software to read the emotional expressions of students could even help the teachers communicate with the students to see what they are struggling with. This way the teacher could discuss with the student about which parts the student does not understand. It would be smart and hughly effecient to enforce this computer software in classrooms. It would have a great effect on not only the students so they could ge good grades, but the teachers too; so they can know how to verbally express themselves while teaching.
