I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program. It is a program where you get to help people and travel the world.

If you like animals you get to help them. Animals such as horses, cows, and mules. You can feed them, and bring water for them, and most of all care for them. Cleaning out the animals stalls and putting food in their bales might be smelly but at least you are doing something to help.

You can also have fun. There are so many activities to do with your friends like baseball and volleyball gmes. There is also table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading,and whittling.

You would also get to travel around the world to different places to sight see. Examples of that are you could go to Greece seeing the Acopolis, Europe and China, and take a gondola ride in Italy.

This trip will make you realize and be aware of the people and counties and their needs. Your helping people meet their needs. The more people helping the less people struggleling to make a living in this world. Their are so many people that do not have breakfast to wake up to, or a warm bed to sleep in, or even toys to play with. That is why we need you.

These are reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program. There is so much you could do that it is a really amazing opportinity. To help animals, to help people, and traveling learning about different cutures, making new friends and having fun!!
