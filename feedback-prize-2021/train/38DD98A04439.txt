Have you seen venus in the sky while your star gazing? although venus is often refered to as "earth's twin", it is challenging to explore. venus is one of the more challenging planets to explore for a couple of reasons. those reasons are, the caron monoxide, sulfuric asid, andand the severe temperatures.

venus is covered with a thick blanket of carbon monoxide. this is one of the reasons that makes it very dangerouse to go there. based on the article "the challenge of exploring venus", venus has " a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon monoxide" .this mutch carbon monoxide is very dangerouse.

the even more chalenging part is the sulferic acid.

the clouds on venus are filled with sulferic acid. not only is that dangerouse but the sulferic acid is,"highly corrosive". highly corrosif is almost like saying flamable.

and if the sulferic acid wasnt dangerouse/hot but the temperatuer alone is enough to kill you. here on earth we experience heat but on venus the heat is extreme. in the article it states, "on the planets surface ,temperatures average over 800 degrees farenhieght"

if you were wanting to try making it, good luck, but based on the information it seems like it is not recomended. so stay home on earth. enjoy the fresh air and life that awaits you. it is to dangerouse to waste your time on.
