As you know, as a scientist we come across many misunderstandings. The "Face" on Mars is one of them. This landform was created by natural causes; saying that it was created by a differrent lifeform is irrelavent. It's irrelavent because NASA would have a higher budget than we do now to explore further, if you take a look at the pictures the three are very distinct, and the third photo didn't show any other landforms, pyramids, houses, or lifeforms.

NASA's budget is assgined to them by the new discoveries they find in outter space. If there were alien life on planet Mars we would've told the public, federal government, etc. because we want that extra money to discover more about it. Why would just hold on to that secret. We took a pictures of the landforms lets see how they turned out.

As we compare the pictures of the same landform there are many differences. The 01' picture we took has multiple cracks and craters in the monument. I'm pretty sure the aliens wouldn't bulid a monument some place it could get beat up at. The 76' and 98' pictures were captured with not too good of a camera, causing it to have the appearance of a face.

In 2001, we had created a camera with the highest camera quality we were able to obtain. We researched and studied on the camera itself to see that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of 43 like the other cameras. We came to the conclusion that we would be able to see any other landforms, lifeforms, ships, etc. ,but all of the above are absent.

In conclusion, there was not any life shown on the picture, so it's irrelavent that aliens created it. We visit our monments. Why were there no aliens visiting thiers? One answer, they didn't bulid it.
