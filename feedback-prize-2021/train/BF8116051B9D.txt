In the article ''Driverless Cars Are Coming,'' they talk about how there is a new invention coming. As you can tell by the title of the article, they give some pros and cons about the new invention. Some thing's the author of the article mentions is how the car works and what kind of details will be in it.

One of the first things they mentioned was how the car works. It tell's how the car would run on half the fuel we use today. Google has already made a car that is ''driverless' and it has not crashed yet. These cars would run on a track that has an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car.

Further on, they also explained some details they might add to the car. One of the details is that the car can handle functions up to twenty-five miles per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Not all of the cars are completely driverless. In fact, the only main things they can do are steer,accelerate, and brake. All are designed to notify the driver when the road requires human skills. Another detail they have is that the drivers seat vibrates when the vehicle is in dangerof backing into something. One last detail they mention is having cameras watch the driver to make sure that the drivers a remaining focused on the road.

With both of those topics being mentioned, I honestly do not think they should make the cars for public use. They say how it will be safer the driver and those around them, but in all honesty, I do not think they will be. One of the details that does not sound reasonible on the car are the cameras. The idea of someone watching you while you drive just does not sound pleasant. Yes it may make sure the driver is staying focused, but I do not think that should be on there. One of the only things about the car that sounds excellent, is the lower fuel usage. With lower fuel also mean less polution which I think is great.
