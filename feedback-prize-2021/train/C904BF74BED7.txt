Asking multiple people for advice might be beneficial for some people, because if you think about it asking other people for advice might help you understand the different perspective of their advice.

For example if you ask someone for advice about how to be better at sports you might ask multiple people so can understand some skills that will benefit you to be better at sports.

Asking people for advice might help you become more successful in life by taking the advice you get.

If you can understanding the advice you get it may help you make better decision, an example will be if you want to buy a house a car or a object that might cost a lot of money, you probably ask multiple people for advice and you will think about it if you are doing the right decision or not.

Asking people for advice benefits everyone because they can know your point of view and you can know their point of view, and after you guys talk to you can understand why they think that advice will benefit you and it might change your perspective towards that advice, we are all different and our opinion might change of how we think about that advice.

In conclusion, in my opinion I think that is good to ask multiple people for advice so you can choose the right thing to do, but some people might disagree with what I think, but I think it benefits you and will help you make better decisions in life.

Asking people for advice will help you be successful in life and it will help you choose the right thing to do.
