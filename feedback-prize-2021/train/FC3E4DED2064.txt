Driverless cars would be a good thing. It would be a big step in technology. Take some risks out of being on the road. It would also save some money. A car that drives itself would be a great achievement.

To begin, if the car drove itself then it wouldnt be as dangerous. When people are drunk they wouldnt wreck because of them being careless. The car can take over and have heads up display. Somthing not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. This makes that a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.

Secondly, The car can save gas money. With the car driving the proper speeds and everything the car wouldnt waste gas. Sergey Brin foresees that the cars would use half of the fuel in todays taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus would. The cars would be a good change for the world and the environment.

Finally, The cars would be a big jump in technology. It would be a big advancement. Radars used to be a big deal now anyone can get them. There are already some cars that can already drive themselves a little but there not ready for the streets. Tesla thinks in 2016 they will release a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. Every day we get closer to having an automated car.

I think the automated cars would be good. The roads would be safer. Cost less money than spending gas all the time. It would be easier to drive the car. The car could be easier to learn.

Overall the driverless car is a great idea.
