I believe the ''Facial Action Coding System'' is a original idea that nobody has never thought of that till now. Teachers can know now when students are not really interested in a assignment or its boring. '' A class computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''Teachers need to know when a student is not feeling well. So you now not to push the students buttons.

The students point of view is that it will be way more better .''Then it could modify the lesson, like an affective human instructor.''My own opinion is that if we had those ''Facial Action Cody System'' would help alot,so the teachers know when we are not interested in a assignment that they end up giving us.''Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.''Not even does this idea help you produce feelings like (happy,sad,and disgusted) them in a drama class, but even tells the teachers what you feel also.

''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking by the look on your face.'' i wish we had this idea at my school but we dont.''of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial that conveys happy,worried,etc..'' I know how i feel when im sad because it is not a good feeling . We know how we feel we just have trouble saying it to teachers or others. With this idea we can actually say how we feel without even saying anything.
