I think that the author did very well at explaining about venus and its worthy pursuit despite the danger. one of venus dangers is that it was 800 degrees fahrenheit which is so hot that if a cellphone was out on the planet it would melt and anything with tin can melt. And the atmospheric pressure there is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. these conditions are far more extrem than anything we have encountered on earth. Its so hot out there that it would liquefy most metals. fun fact is that venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system even though its no the closest to the sun its still the hottest. Venus has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeling to land on its surface. i know your thinking why would people wanna go there, well its because a long time ago scientist think that venus used to be like earth just with alot more water butit was capable to form life there. venus still has some features similer to ones on earth like a surface of rocky sediments and valleys, mountains, and craters. So I think that the author did a very good job at explaining his ideas about venus
