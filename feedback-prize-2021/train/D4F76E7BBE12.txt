To Editor,

Ah, cell phones, the gate to friends across the world, or across the street. This is a good topic. Many things to say. But first, the topic i choose is none, my response is kinda in-between. Cell phones are great, there's about 87% of all Americans that own one. And 3% of that don't because they broke theirs. And something that effects my response is that im one of the 13% that don't own one.

I think that phones should not only be allowed but encouraged. But only for emergencies. We should be able to leve it on vibrate. So incase there's an event that your family got in a car crash you should be able to know. Or if you don't have a ride your not all alone standing there.

And another thing, you should not be able to use them on your free time for the fun. Because you'll end up leaving your friends and eventually losing them. Or they just become more distant.
