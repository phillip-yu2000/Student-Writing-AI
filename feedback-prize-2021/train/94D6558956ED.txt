Studing Venus? Difficult task to acompish but well worth it becasuse Venus is a sister planet to Earth made from the same rock compositon as Earth despite its harsh conditions. My explinaition throught the help of this article should explain why its a great idea to explore venus.

The first reason I pulled from the article explains a very good idea through this quote, "NASA's possible soultion to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. This would be an amazing idea being in some kind of spacecraft just on the ouside of the atomosphere of venus to take pictures and such so humans could map out the surface more. The next parpgraph in the article has a contridiction this is quote explains it "However, peering at from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provdide limited insdight on the ground. To fix this problem they should invent more to it such as a smller hubble telescope mounted on ths ship with a lens capible of breaking through the thick atomosphere or some kind of sonar to map the surface.

The next explantion comes from the quote . "Another project is looking back to an old tehnology called mechanical computers". Thease devices are not excatly lighting fast and getting information could be a little slow but they do not have very many electronics in them more gears and swiches old style things like that. Gears in side of thease mechanical computers tend to be made of a heavy material that can hold up better.
