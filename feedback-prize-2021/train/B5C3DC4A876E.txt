My position is that driverless cars are a ggod idea if the human can take control at anytime. The cars seem like a good idea bacuse for one they can't get intoxicated and kil other people. The cars are also a good idea becuase technolgy is more efficient than any human is,but a human can take control at anytime which is important. In conclusion the technology will be more efficient and safe in the long term.

There are issues with technology that can imopact society in such a drastic way. Some issues include malfunctions in the car and it's sensors. For example in 2013 BMW came out with a self propelled car that coud handle driving functions up to 25 mph. It is very important that upkeep and testing are done with these cars. Testing will ensure driver's safety which is the biggest concern. The upkeep on a car should rely on the driver. For example,if someone gets in an accident because their tail light was out,the fault is placed on the driver. The same concept should be applied in the maintence of this technology.

Driverless cars arent actually diver free .These new cars should be equipped with a human to take over when necesary. If there is not an alert person watching the streets the passengers take a risk of accidents .These cars are a good idea based on the idea that a person can blink their eyes and in the wrong scenerio get in a car accident. The effenciency of the technogy plays a big role in the safety and so does an aware driver. In conclusion,I beleive that driverless cars are a good idea if aware people,upkeep on vehicles ,and reliable technology are all in place.
