Having a device that reads the emotions of humans would no doubt be very valuable. The device would cause the teacher to know the emotions of every one of their students and in return, the teacher would be more effective. Due to the new information they have, the teacher could change the style of teaching, change their lesson plans, or ask the students why they are feeling what, based on the emotions of the students.

Students have a way of staring blankly when teachers are talking. While the students are not paying attention to the teacher's lecture, the teacher is worrying about how to get the attention of his or her students. But the teacher has no idea how the students are feeling, and the students end up not learning anything. In this common situation, the teacher would have been greatly helped if they knew the emotions of their students. If the teacher knew the students were tired, he or she could have made them do a brain exercise or a warm-up. The teacher could have used a conversation starter or made the class more interactive to gain the students' attention.

Once one gains the attention of the students, teaching becomes a lot easier. The students start to have more fun, and they learn effectively. Because students are learning more and becoming smarter, more will go to college and succeed in life at a higher rate.

Although the use of the Facial Acyion Coding System for the teacher and the learning of the students, it would be an invasion of privacy. Students might feel weirded out by the fact that the teacher knows every single emotion they have. Also, it turns out that humans tend to be pretty good at reading each others' emotions, so it might not be all that beneficial, depending on the teacher.

The best way to deal with the invasion of privacy factor, would be to receive consent from all of the students and their parents. If this step is passed, the students will receive a better education and overall, be better students.
