As it shows in the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", towns or cities like the experimental town of Vauban, Germany, are capable of continuing life without the added stress of owning a car and lowering the greenhouse emissions caused by them. Although the majority of the citizens do not own a vehicle, there are about 30 percent who do, and those who don't, either ride a bicycle or on what little amount public transportation there is. Out of the 70 percent of Vauban's families that do not own a car, 57 percent sold theirs to move there.

Areas all around the world are beginnig to do the same as Vauban. Creating areas that do not require vehicles mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing the majority of the worlds climate change. Even in Paris they are beginning to cut back on vehicle usage due to large amounts of smog. In 2014, Smog in Paris measured 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter which is more than other European capitals with Brussels at 114 and 79.7 in London.
