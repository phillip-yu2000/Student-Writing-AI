Extracurricular activities are a fun way for students to be involved in something worthwhile after the school day is complete. They can be fun, challenging, and a great way to learn something new. Extracurricular activities are also a way to spend time with friends and to get active. I think every student should participate in one activity because of these reasons. I agree with the principal's decision to mandate that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

After school activities are a great opportunity for students to learn a new skill. For example, if a student was considering playing basketball for a couple of years, but never really got into it, his or her school might have a club that they could be a part of. This holds true for many other activities, such as painting and cooking, only to name a few.

A student could try out many different activities over the course of the year to try new things and find out what they enjoy and are good at. The teenage years are the time in a person's life that they should explore new activities to have fun and discover what their talents are.

Another positive quality of extracurricular activities is that they allow students to spend time with their friends. Friends with a common interest can go to an after school activity to spend time together and do something they all enjoy. Students can also share one of their hobbies with friends who are interested in trying it out. For example, a student's friend might express interest in coding, which that student does after school. The student can take his or her friend to the coding club, so the friend can test it out. The student can guide the friend through the activity, while still letting them explore it and try it out. Students also have a huge chance to meet new people who share a common interest with them. Extracurricular activities are great for strengthening old friendships and establishing new ones, as well.

Finally, extracurricular activities are a great way for students to get active. This may be physically, in the case of a sport like flag football or working out in the school's fitness room. However, it could also mean getting active in the school, like working on the yearbook or serving on the student council. Students can also help out their communities through extracurricular activities. One example is an environmental club that participates in cleanups for a park or their school, building gardens, and spreading awareness of climate change. Getting active in an activity also cuts down on time students spend at home on electronic devices. This generation of kids spends a lot of time on cellphones and playing video games, so after school activities are a way to make students' time after school well spent.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are a way for students to be a part of something outside of the regular school day that is fun and rewarding to them. The activities give them a chance to learn something new, spend time with friends, and to get active. Most schools have many activities for students to try, so their options are not very limited. Whether it's something they've been doing for years, or a new interest, these activities give students a place to display their skills. I think the principal has made the right decision by having each student participate in an extracurricular activity.
