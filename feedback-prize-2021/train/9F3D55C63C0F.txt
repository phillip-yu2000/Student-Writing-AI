Why should students have to have a "B" grade average to play sports if in college they only need a "D" grade average? Do you think we are more prepared for that than college students?

Not only are we not more prepared than college students we are less prepared than college students. You would keep a star athlete from getting scouted just because they don't have a "b". That would be depriving that student from a scholarship and possibly farther education. That is wrong you might destroy our futures because you want us to have better grades. Let me tell you something grades are not everything. people can go on just fine without good grades. Take Albert Enstien for example he was one of the smartest men of all time and he dropped out of school. I'm not saying that kids can just drop out of school that would be ignorant of me but just getting a good grade is not that important. A grade "c" average is not bad you can get in to a very nice university with a "C" average.

athletics are very important for schools. Sports teach team work and always giving your one hundred and twenty percent at every thing that you do. So if you don't let kids play sports their grades will drop even lower .It also teach
