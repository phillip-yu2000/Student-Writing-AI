Going 'car-free' seems like an excellent idea!  Perhaps even less days of usage.  It would be safer and bring cleanliness to the air to whole new level.  No more angry citizens beacuse of global warming and our atmosphere will stop getting thinner.  As well as less deaths due to a motor vehicle.

Our streets will be so safe that parents will not have to worry as much about their kids getting abducted or hit by a car.  For example if we were to only use public transportation such as buses there is no way that a child or adult can be taken and successfully brought to the destination of the persons choice.  Simply because there will be no where to hide or secretly place the child or adult.

The amount of deaths would drop dramatically if cars were used less on a daily basis. There would be less D.U.I'S,  distracted driving,  even collisions because some young individual decided to break the law.  So many positive things to think of and yet the court would still have to deal with these occaisional issues.

At least they would be occaisional.

The air would be so clean that no one would have to worry so much about pollution.  The atmosphere would not contiue to get thinner through time.  Thus buying us more time to eventually find a permanent fix in the future.  Rioting would most likely come to an end because of these acts.  We can also look foward to what some prefer to call 'crazy folks' to have signs around thier necks and around town claiming the world will end soon.  All of this would come to an end because we stopped using cars as much. Last but not least, people of the world and Earth itself would lead a happy and healthier life because we wont inhale so much toxic air and polluted Earth's air.
