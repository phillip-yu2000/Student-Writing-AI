Dear Principal,

I think that you should definitely choose Policy 1. I think this is a good decision based on some very important facts. The environment of an emergency, it gives students a sense of freedom, and that it can cause less trouble if they have their cell phones with them.

In the environment of an emergency, I believe that if students have their cell phones, that they can call their parents. Not during school hours regularly, but in the case of an emergency. If they did not have their phones with them and their was an emergency, then their parents might not be able to contact them and they will be worried. Also, if they were sick, and the school didn't have any phones, they could call and tell their parents to pick them up from school.

If students were allowed to bring their cell phones to school, it would cause less trouble at school. If cell phones were not allowed, then they would get in a lot of trouble if they brought them. (And rebellious teens will do that.) What I mean by that is that if students were allowed to have their cell phones at school, then there would be less problems with taking phones away.

Lastly,

I think that if students have their cell phones, it will give them a sense of freedom. If they had to stay at school all day and have no contact with other people in other schools during their free time, then I think that they would be mad at the school. But if they could talk to other people during their free time, not during their class time, then I think the students would like school more.

Needless to say, there will always be people who try to break the rules and use their phones during class. The same would happen with people bringing cell phones to school in Policy 2. Even so, I still believe that the students would be happier at school and maybe pay attention more in class if you used Policy 2.

Sincerely,
