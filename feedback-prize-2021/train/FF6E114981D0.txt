People ask for advice on a daily basis, But is asking more then one person to much advice. You need more then one persons advice for differentÂ things and everybody has an opinion on different things so you should as multiple people for any advice you need. There can be people who agree with you and who dont agree with you so its always good to know both sides of the story.

Lets say you want a new pet so you ask 5 of your friends what you should get between a puppy and a grown dog, You might want a puppy but not all your friends might agree with you,3 out of 5 friends say you should get a puppy because it is energetic and you can see it grow and it will be loyal to you because it has been your puppy for along time,2 out of 5 friends say you should get a grown up dog because it will be trained and it will not pee in your house as much as puppies do,both sides of your friends gave very good advice so now you can think about what you really want.

Getting advice from more then one person like you mom and from your dad you can ask them how a dress looks on you,your mom will know what to look at like how your body looks in it how it fits you all these things but you dad on the other hand wont say as much as your mom he might just say it looks nice without really looking at every little detail on your dress.

Getting more then one opnion isnt as bad as some people might think its very helpful if you dont know what to do or think at some giving point its alright you never know what you might hear or find out so it all works out in the end game.
