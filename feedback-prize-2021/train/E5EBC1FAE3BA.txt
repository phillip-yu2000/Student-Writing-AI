In society today transportation is neccessary to keep most things going. Cars are one of the biggest transportation devices used. The advantages of limiting car usage range from taking away stress to lowering air pollution.

Stress is one of the biggest factors faced while driving. Continuously having to check for cars around you, looking for open spaces to race by the car infront of you, and waiting in those horrible traffic jams that waiste useful time in your life. Reducing the amount of car usage will lead to exercise which reduces stress and less waiting time for multiple things. As stated in source 1, paragraph 3 a resident of Vauban says "When I had a car I was always tense." Mentally driving is a lot to handle and always has you worried no matter how comfortable your car is.

A really big problem in our environment today is air pollution. Reduced car usage leads to less gas having to be drilled from oil mines and places underground. It also comes with a bundle of less smog and a stronger, cleaner, atmosphere. Even a businessman in Columbia commented "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," in source 3 paragraph 24 as he participated in the annual car-free day. The better the environment and air pollution the healthier the oxygen.

Helping the Earth is essentially and always will be helping our selves.
