Making computers understand human emotions and feelings, sounds like a great thing to have personally I thinnk that it could be. Having a computer or your phone basically know you and what you like can really make things easier when it comes to looking for things, shopping online and like in the article school work and understanding lessions. This is a resouce that is very valuable to all students in the classroom, I feel that it is useful because like in the reading it states " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Meaning that the computer will automatically change its way of teaching to find way that is fit for you, something like this in schools could completely change the way of school all together, and a great way for easy teaching. Now some might think other wise because of alot of problems that could possibly go wrong with it such as the cost of that software, If the software makes any mistakes, and weather or not the software would work for every student I also can see kids becoming lazy being a big problem too. why I still feel that this is a great idea and should actually be in school I also think for the fight of it that the parent should have to choose weather they would want there kids to experiment with it. Overall this software should be out there for every child to use if they so please.
