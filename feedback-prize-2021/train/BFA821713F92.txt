The choice of who becomes president should be left to the Electoral College. The people are the ones who vote for slate electors and the outcome is fair. This is why the decision of who becomes president shdould be left for the Electoral College to decide.

The first reason why deciding the president should be left to the Electoral College is because the slate electors are voted on by the people. Each party chooses a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. There is the possibility that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the popular vote. Even though that happens very rarely. Voters are needed when choosing slate electors because a single persons vote may effect who is chosen fo the position. The Electoral College is decided on by voters and wheather or not someone votes may change who becomes the slate elector for your state.

Another reason the Electoral College shuld remain is because the outcome of the vote is fair to voters. A presidential candidate, required by the Electoral College, is to have a trans-regional appeal so that if he or she is favored by one region the residents of the other regions do not feel as though their votes do not count. The weight in the political balance that large states lose is restored by the Electoral College.  Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign and are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

The decision over who becomes president should be for the Electoral College. The Electoral College is chosen by the voters of each state and has the larger chance of the outcome being fair. The people choose their slate electors and trust them with voting for the party's nominee. these are reasons why the Electoral College should be the deciding factor on who does and does not become our new president.
