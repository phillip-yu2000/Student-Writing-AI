The author has been studying Venus to find out if humans can live there and there are some reason that humans cant live there.

The author says that Venus has many feature like earth and that it may be possible for humans to live there. Even though they have seen what could happen like the bad part of living there, they are still trying to find a way to make humans live there. Venus is like Earths "twin" because it is the closest planet to the earth unlike the other planets. Also, Venus atmosphere of carbon dioxide is 97 percent.

Venus may be worth studying for but despite the danger that it may have to any human could be bad and even though the author says that they are going to have to make humans a part of there studyies so they can find a way to live there. In the text it says that "numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite the proximity to us" saying that they will have to study humans no matter what.

Therefore, Venus may be wirth to study it but is it really worth putting humans a part of your study just to be right. There are may factors that Venus has that are very dangerous to us.
