If someone were to ask multiple people for advice, they are most likely trying to get different peoples perspectives or different opinions to either decide which one is more logical or makes more sense in the situation. Because for example, if someone needed help with a friend, one person might know the friend and had a past with the friend and their response could be more bias compared to someone who doesn't know your friend.

Say someone asked me for advice. I would first, figure out the issue, second think about it for a while, while thinking what would be best for the person to do, and third, give a non-bias response. When people give bias responses, it's typically not the best advice. Because usually, when the response is bias, it's based off something that happened with the person who you're talking to and it could conflict with your situation.

What I typically do is when I hear multiple peoples advice is, I usually collaborate them. If I hear two peoples advice I always think about them both, if they both seem like a good idea and I try my best to collaborate them together while still adding in my own opinion because I don't just want to use other peoples thinking, I want to use my own in these cases.

Sometimes people could ask the wrong people for advice and it could influence you make make a not-so-smart choice. It's always a good idea to be open minded but you just have make sure to always be aware that sometimes people don't really know what they are talking about. That's why it's good to get a second source to help you balance or decided what final move your going to make.

Last, I think it's a good idea overall to ask for help. It shows that you are strong and confident enough to ask and it shows you want to take action in your life. asking multiple people is a great way to get a good answer and be confident with it.
