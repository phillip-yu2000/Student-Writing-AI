Are driverless cars coming? I hope not. I don't think having a car based on technology would be a good thing for us. People should drive their own cars and not have technology do it for them. People need responsiblity.

If a driverless car breaks down on the road, who is there to take care of it? No one, so it could just sit there forever. Driverless cars can be more dangerous then cars with people in them. Say there is a person walking on the side of the road, will the car see them? If the car didnt see them and hit and killed them, who would be responsible? You can't blame anyone, because it's no ones fault. That is why we should not have driverless cars.

Say it was snowing outside, and the driverless car didn't sense that the road was icy and ran into the back of another car that was stopped at a stoplight. Driverless cars will just cause more and more problems on the road. We need to stick to actual people driving cars to keep the road more safe.

Now I know that driverless cars would help people in many ways. It would save money for some, and possibly give people free transportation, but it's just not worth it. They would cause many more accidents on the road. Yes they would save money, but having non regular cars would save lifes.

People just need to realize that having driverless cars is not the way to go. We need to not be lazy and drive our own cars. We need responsiblity. Having driverless cars would cause more and more problems than we need. That is why I think we need to keep non driverless cars on the road.
