I am totaly against driverless cars. I do not think that should continue they're production on these vehicles. Simply because they are already having issues. For example in paragraph two they say the car cannot operate or minuver through traffic , road blocks, accidents etc.

So what if there's a storm, or a tornado, or earth quake or something? Will the car know what to do then? If you're going to have to take over you might as well drive it yourself anyway. What could you possibly do for those short moments of time anyway? A driver is always supposed to stay alert and focussed no matter what. Whether you are driving or not because you never know what could happen. Safety first! I dont think a computer is accuipt enough or qualified to think , act, or make decisions a human is supposed to make.

Then what happens if you do decide to let the car do what it is programed for and ypou do get in accident or get hurt? Then what like they said in paragraphs 9 & 7, the big argument will be who,s fault is it, the driver or manufacturer? Well my opinion is driver, because its states that the car wouldn t knolw what to do in these type of situations and youre werent focused and did not jump in when you should have all the more reason you should drive yourself so there will be no reason for this argument. I just really dont think these cars will be that much useful, I actualy really think they will be the cause of alot of future problems.
