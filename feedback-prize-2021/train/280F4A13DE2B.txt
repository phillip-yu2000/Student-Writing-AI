I think the principle should go with option of letting us use are phones during lunch and the other school brake times instead of the option of not having phones at school at all. Many of the students have there own cell phone and some students might need it for different occasion's to communicate with are family, parents, or guardian. An example would be me i needed my phone to contact my parents during are lock down that happened not to long ago, i sent them a message from my phone to tell them "mom we are on lock down so i cant leave the school i don't know what time we will be out ill call or message you when its ok for us to leave" that really helped me to communicate with my parents and if the principle went with the option of not having phones at school there probably wouldn't have been any way to have told my parents we were on lock down. I think going with the option of using phones during lunch is a good idea, it might even stop students from using there phones during class when there not suppose to, knowing as soon as there done with class and they leave they have time to communicate with friends or family. It can help students grades and can stop students from not paying attention to the lesson or teacher while they use there phones. Students would enjoy using there phones and knowing they don't have to hide it or get in trouble for using there phones during a break.
