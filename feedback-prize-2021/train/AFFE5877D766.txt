A Step in the Right Direction

Cars are a great means of transportation. Unfortunately nothing is perfect. Cars have many advantages, and like everything, disadvantages too. People rely too heavily on their private vehicles especially with the easy accessability of public transportation. Limiting the use of cars limits pollution, which is a growing issue among many people.Â  Among that, there are many other advantages too. Limiting the use of cars is certainly a step in the right direction.

As the ice near the poles shrink, the problem of global warming grows. Global warming has been linked to car emmisions. Limiting cars will limit emmisions of harmful gasses into the air. Sadly people seem to like their cars more than the environment. This is unfortunate because there are so many other ways to get around. For some reason people are just too close minded to try something else. If the amount of cars on the road shrinks, then the amount of pollution going into our envirenment will follow. Car-free days in major cities is a good way to get the car-free trend started. With large turnouts, it certainly gets people open to the idea(Source 3). Saying that, this will not work long term. Getting the ball rolling and keeping the ball rolling are two completely different things. Car free cities is a better long term strategy(Source 1).

Now lets talk about our economy. Most people probably wish it was a little better. Jobs make a strong economy. If people didnt have cars they would be in need of some public transportation. Instead of paying that monthly payment on your car, go take the bus. The demand for public transportation would rise immensily thus the supply would follow; opening more jobs.

All in all, limiting the use of cars has more advantages than disadvantages. Most of the potential problems could be easily fixed with a little bit of brain power. Opening more jobs and cleaning up the envirenment should be reason enough to switch over to a car-free lifestyle.
