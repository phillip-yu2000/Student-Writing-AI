Students who don't like to go to classes have their reasons. The main reason is, they don't know the knowledge by themselves, If they were to asked to attend the class in which the professor teaches something they already have known, it would be pain. Not attending class students can control their time more freely and are likely not to waste time. Although, I agree that there may be one or two advantages to not attending class. I insist that the advantages of joining classes far overweight them.

In the first place, professors can teach students a lot of things that can't be otained from books. In the book, normally there is just concentrated knowledge. The professor will not only teach them some knowledge. The professor will let the students know how to use and develop it.

Students will be benefited from the discussing with your classmates if they are attending classes. Different people have their own special capability. One people cannot be good at everything in life. What is the best way to share your knowledge with others? Go to the class! Professors always give some topics for students to be able to think about amd discuss it.

In conclusion, I believe that students should attend classes. Not only because they need it, but professor can teach you the method of how to master and develop the knowledge. Students can also learn from each other in the class too.Â
