Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to say I agree with you on making students with only a A-B grade average play in any sports or after school activities. Even though there is a lot of students with a C grade average, I think this will make students work harder to bring up their grade so they can play in sports or activities again. I think the parents with children that have a C average think that they wasted their money on sports when the coaches are going to cut them off anyways. But i feel as though if they are going to do this, they should tell the parents and the students that they are going to cut them off because of their grade below a B so they could give the student a chance to bring the grade up. If they don't give the parents or students a warning about this there will be a lot of parents complaining. And nobody wants complaining parents because they could tell their friends with children that do play in sports that the coaches are just going to cut them off anyways, so why not just quit now so you don't feel embarrassing getting cut off. I believe you should take control and make this a school policy because this would make our school look better than any others.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
