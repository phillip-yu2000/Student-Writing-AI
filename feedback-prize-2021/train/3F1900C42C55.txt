"Do voters really control whom thier elector picks for"(9)we should switch to a direct voting system. With electoral college going voters dont always have control on who the electors from their state pick. In some instanses the electoral voters vote is more valued than the peoples vote. Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct vote not an electoral vote.

the electoral vote weighs more than the popular vote, this in unfair because if a mass of people vote for one president and a few electoral voters choose the other president the people dont get the president they wanted, the electoral voters do. So we could expect that a popular vote winner couid yet again lose presidency to the electoral vote. But electoral votes blance out the states say in the vote, if a big state all votes against a small state the big one will win the electoral college balances that, but the popular vote is everyones say not a couple of peoples say.

60% of voters would prefer a direct vote. a direct vote would give the people more voice in the election instead of the few in the electoral college. If we abolish the electoral college the popular vote will be the main vote counted and there will be not more electoral college. Using a direct voting system the people will get the president that they want and voted for(ex. Al Gore)

If the elecrotal vote goes to a tie then it goes to the house of representatives and there each state has one representataive, that one person is voting for thousands of people. That one representative can go against their states wishes and vote for whom ever they choose,So this could lead to bribing the rep into voting for some one else. So the popular vote doesnt help the president get selected.

This is why we should swich to a direct voting system. So the people have more say in who gets to be their president for the next four years. The popular vote cannot be bribed or altered. And the popular vote is everyones vote, not a few or even one persons decision.
