Dear TEACHER_NAME;

What happened if thers a event but you have to clean up for community service? Is right to do the right thing. Community service is important to the community because in the future the community change and everybody is happy. Some people doesn't wannabe help or they have other things to do. Is the same thing as school. Some students is in Community service.

First reason, that Community service is important because the mayor of the city will be proud. Some people say ''What a mess is here!''. The community service is come for help. When you left trash then later it will smell bad. Some people hated when this happened. Please don't leave thrash on the floor put it in the trash can.

Second reason is that when there's a event the people who work there have to clean up before the event starts. Some people think that takes too much time away but no. They just want to help people and the community. In school is the same thing friends doesn't want to help and some to.

Last reason is that there's too much to clean up and during the night. Janitors need to clean up during the night because when the next day comes it will be clean and neat. Some people clean up their stuff alone and sometimes together.

I think t
