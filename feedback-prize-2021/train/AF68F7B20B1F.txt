Dear Principal,

I believe that the 1st policy will be good for are school. The reasons for this is that students may need to call home is they forgot something or just time to talk to other friends that don't go to there school. Lunch is a time to relax and talk about what has happened during the 1st part of school and time to talk to people that don't go to their school, and kids that are very stressed about school and can just relax and talk to other people. If there is a case where a student is being miss treated and they feel unwelcome by their classmates and they can call to talk to someone. Maybe the kids that go to school don't have any friends at school so they can call people that make them fell better than the kids at their school. I feel that sometimes having a cell phone is like a protector it makes the kids fell save when they have it with them. Yes, i think that putting away after lunch and free time and turning them of so that it doesn't temp them to text someone or them. This is a good thing so that the kids don't get distracted with it, so that it will not effect their ability to learn during the class time. I hope you take to heart at what I have said. I feel that all students should have all the rights to have their phones with during free time and at lunch with them. Some kids need their phones to make them feel good about themselves, the ones that are shy, and don't really fit in at the school. Well I have to get back to class, have a great day.

Sincerely,
