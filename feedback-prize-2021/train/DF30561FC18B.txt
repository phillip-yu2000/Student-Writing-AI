Dear principle,

I think that students should not be able to use or have phones present during the school day. It is something that kids shouldn't worry about during the school day. phones should only be used in schools in the event of an emergency. Cell phones may cause problems in times that the student is working and will prevent he or she from completing their work.

Their is always the argument that cell phones may help students get rid of stress by talking to someone when no others can hear. That they could talk to friends that across the school or to another school. This could a chance for them to hang out with a friend that they cant see during the school day.

This could also have many down sides. This could lead to a increased risk of having cell phones away for saying stuff that is not needed or allowed to be said in school. This would increase the risk of student getting ISS, OSS, or even kicked out of school for not needed behavior. It could also lead to fights. Even cell phone theft or misplacement of a cell phone.

I hope that you will take what I have said into consideration. The school will stay a more friendly place to be. Their will be no unnecessary disruptions. The kids will be better off with no cell phones allowed to be used in the school building.

Someone who cares.
