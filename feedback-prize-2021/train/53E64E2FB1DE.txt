Dear Principal

I think that all students should not be required to perform community service. Because what if a student always has a lot of home work to do after school but has little time to do it so he or she would want a study hall during school so that they can finish their work in school, but if they have community service they would probably have little to no time to do their work so they would rush threw it and do poorly on the assignment.

In other cases some student's might want to get home relax and just do stuff with their friends instead of working almost all day, but they can't because they would have community service. It's not bad it should just be optional for the people who want to do it and for the people who want to do it.

So that is why I do not support the idea of having community service for students t do.
