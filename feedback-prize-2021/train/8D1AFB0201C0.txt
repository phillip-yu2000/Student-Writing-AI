Dear Principal,

I have heard of your two choices that you have established about the rules of cell phones at our school. I think you should choose to allow your students to use cell phones during free time and lunch periods. I think that it isn't doing the school any harm and is a reasonable suggestion. Cell phones may be needed during lunch because sometimes i forget my lunch at home and have to call my parents to drop it off, this may happen to other students as well. They also may be needed during school when students need to be picked up, if there feeling sick or have somewhere else important to be. I can think of many times when i needed to use my cell phone at school , so if you take away cell phone usage at school, it might just lead up to other serious uprisings with the students here. I'm sure you can trust us, great students, to respect the rule of no cell phones any time except our free time.

Thank you for your time,
