Why seeking multiple opinions is better choice. I think seeking multiple opinions is better because it could give you great ideas, it could also help you through hard decisions, it could give the right answer.

Imagine you were with your friends and ya'll were going shopping once you got in the store you ask ''should I get this shirt of that shirt'' and they decide which one you should get your asking them for their opinion and what they think about it. They also might have a good idea if your in a tight spot or get you through the hard times and lead in the right direction so you won't have problems later but it could be a good decision it could give so many opportunities and experiences through out life.

Even though the choice look wrong they might be right choice to go with it might be wrong you learn from your mistakes and try again to succeed but in the end at least you tried.

And that is why I think asking people for their ideas and opinions is a good call to making the right decision.
