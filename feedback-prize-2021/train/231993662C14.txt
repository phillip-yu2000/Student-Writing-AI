Dear Principal,

Community service is great for students. It helps us understand what is going on in our community and how to help it. In every grade of school, students should be required to have at least a few hours of community service. It even looks good on an application to get into college. Community service also shows us that we are proud to be where we are and what we have.

First of all, community service lets us understand how we can help out in different ways all around us. From helping serve food at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to just helping pick up trash at our school. We can grow into being a better person knowing that we have helped. It can shape us for when we get to be adults in the world. Helping out in our community shows us what is happening on all sides of us.

After students graduate high school, most of them are going to college. When they get an application and fill it out saying that they have helped out in there community, then the college will consider even more to accept them. It shows that, that student is willing to help, work, and be a good person. Colleges want students who are smart and nice and who love to help out.

Helping out in a community not only helps other people, it helps you. Most students say that its to much work and we don't get anything from it. That is not true because we do get something from helping out. We get the feeling of pride and joy knowing that they have helped someone with less things than they have. You get a feeling that nothing else can really ever replace.

In conclusion, I think that there should be a requirement of at least a few hours to help out in our community. It shows us what is happening in the world around us and how to help it. Community service shows us how to be a better person and how to embrace being that person. Not only does it look good on a college application but it helps shape our lives in ways we can never dream of.
