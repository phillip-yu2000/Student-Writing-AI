Dear Principle,

Now days students are all for technology. We write essays on computers, call friends for help on our cell phones, and read text books online. So I think policy one would be a better choice for our school.

A lot of parents think that cell phones are getting in the way of school, but it is the opposite. School is getting in the way of us using our cell phones. In schools every where students are sneaking text messages under the desk during class because they feel school takes up there free time, so if you allow student to use there cell phones during lunch periods it limit our use during class time.

Another reason is that cell phones keep us up to date. We hear about news happening all around the world on our cell phones. We can make sure there have not been any shootings or earth quakes that have injured our loved ones during the time we are at school. We can check the weather on the phones so we know if we need a jacket when we walk outside or if our afternoon activities have been canceled do to rain. Having a cell phone is like having a news paper.

If the school chooses policy one it can limit paper use in our community . We can enter our homework , research projects ,and even write essays on our phones. Having our cell phones will also keep us awake and thinking during the day. Students will know that the school respects their time.

We bring school into our social lives everyday. Like when we spend two hours doing our homework or studying for test. So I think we should be able to bring a little part of our social lives to school. Policy one will keep us updated about the news, keep us awake, and even help the environment.
