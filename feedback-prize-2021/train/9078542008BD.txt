Dear state senator,

I think we should'nt have the Electoral College because the system will go all wrong because who were actually voting for, unfair to voters, and its outdated and irrational. These are the reasons why i think that we shouldnt have Electoral College.

We shouldnt have it because voters dont actually vote for the president they want, but for a slate of eletors who is turn to elect the president which is unfair. If you wanted to vote for a president but you arent in that area you wouldnt be voting for that peron you'll be voting for a slate of 34 electors who pledge to that person. That will make the person get 34 electoral votes. This will be unfair to the voters and who they want to vote for.

The Electoral College is unfair to voters because whoever wins takes all the systems in each state, candidates dont spend any time in the states they have no chace of winning, and only focusing on the "swing states". In 2000 campaign the state didnt see the candidates at all. Why would you put your fate in the hands of people you never see or in a few swing voters?

The most worries people have is if there is a tie in the electoral vote. If that happen the election wouldnt be up to us at all and we dont want that. You would have to choce the vice president because we only got one vote. Even the house's can hardly even be expected to reflect the will of the people.

These are the reasons why i think that we should'nt have the Electoral College because who we actually vote for, unfair, an its outdated and irrational. Please take a momment and read about this and think about what the people want and how it will be fair and eaier for us and you.

From, Melissa
