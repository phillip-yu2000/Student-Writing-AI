Image having to do a activity for school. Your principal is making everyone do an activity and it is not good because some kids need rest and some do not like to do and kind of sport or activity. Also kids need time to relax and do things they want to do.

Kids need rest because they already do lots of work and they need to have energy to do any activity. Also kids like to rest and not do activity's resting make them do activity's so they need to rest. Kids like to hang out with there friends and talk when they do activity's they will not be able to talk to each other and hang out is like resting because they are not going to run and do stuff they like having fun talking to each other. resting is a good thing for kids because they need energy for other stuff.

A lot of kids like to play indoors and not do activity's. kids like to play video games with friends and they have fun. Also there are kids that dont like going outside and like staying in inside they can read play games play with friends because they might have not any interest in anything or not might have many friends to play with in an activity. Kids don't like doing stuff that have to do with activitys they like doing there own thing.

Your princpal makes you do activity for school. kids need rest and some kids just don't like doing activity's. I think making themdo an activity is not good if i was the principal i would let them do what they want to do if they want to stay insidethats ok if they are tired thats ok if they want do club they can.
