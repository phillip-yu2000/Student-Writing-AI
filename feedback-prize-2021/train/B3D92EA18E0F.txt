Dear Florida Senator,

As a citizen, i believe that the Electoral College system isn't a very smart idea. If you think about it, it's pretty unfair to us votes. We live in a country where they say that we have the right to vote. But in reality, with the Electoral College system in play, that right is taken away from us.

Basica lly

, when we vote, we don't actually vote for the president himself. We are voting for the slate of electors, in hopes that they vote the way we would like them too. Although is is rare that an electors votes against his own party, it isn't unheard of. That right there is a huge reason why we cant trust this system. We cant control who our electors vote for.

In worst case, there is a tie in the electoral vote andÂ  the election is thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegation vote on the President. Because each state only gets one vote, there would be only one person representing the 500,000 voters in Wyoming, and 1 person representing the 35 people that live in California. This is an unbalanced way to represent each state.

Basically, the Electoral College is unf air to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system, candidates don't spend much times in the smaller states because they don't count for so many votes. They focus on the larger, "swing states" that will count for more. For example, during the 2000 campaign, there were 17 states that didn't even get the chance to see the candidates at all.

In their defense, the Electoral College does avoids run-off elections. For example, in 1968 Nixon had only a 43 percent plurality of popular votes, but won the electoral vote. There is a lot of pressure when no candidate wins the people vote and this stress is reduced, which produces a clear winner.

All in all, the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and can't be trusted. People who support it, need a reality check. They don't realize that the system completely disregards their voting rights as a citizen.
