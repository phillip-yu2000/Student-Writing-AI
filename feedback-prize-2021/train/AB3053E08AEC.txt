Dear Principal,

I believe in Policy number 1. Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I believe kids should have their phones during free times because if there was an emergency at school like a lockdown, the kids can call 911 and their parents to let them know that everyone is all right and maybe come pick their kid up. The same rule applies to a fire drill. If their was an emergency, a phone in the hands of hundreds of students would come in handy. Some students have those types of parents, the over protected parents who encourage their kids to take something to school at least to contact their parents once or twice a day to let their parents know they are all right. Even if taking phones to school is against the rules some kids do it. When the kid uses the phone in school, most of the time the teachers don't even notice because they are teaching a class of twenty to thirty kids and the teachers cant be focused on one particular kid or even search kids to see if they have their phones. As long as the kids pay attention in class with their phones turned off and out of site, then i think a phone would be fine in school. The kids should be allowed to use their phones during a free period because the kids aren't learning or being taught information during that time, the kids are having fun with their friends talking about teenage life. Policy two doesn't work for me because if there was a lockdown drill and nobody could get to the phones to call 911 because if they tried moving to another room to do that they would get caught by the bad guys, the phones in the hands of hundreds of kids would come in handy because then they could call 911 quietly in a safe room and get help saving their school from what could possibly have been a shootout.
