Would the use of technology to read emotional express be valuable in class?

The use of technnolgy is very useful in th classroom, it helps students with many tasks. Using tecnology to read emotional expressions would be great way of helping teachers knowing how their student feels during class or during a lession. The process of using to technology to read emotions is when a computer conducts a 3-D computer model of the face. The face has 44 major muscels that the computer memorises. Eckman has classified 6 basic emotions "happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness".

Most facial expressions are universal, even though many people show many kinds of emotion video imagry can track these kinds of facial movements. When you look a friends you can tell how their feeling by the look on their face. But most people struggle at describing how they feel. Using this technology at school will let teachers know if a student is having a bad day and they can help them feel better or make their day better. Classrooms can start by having a Classroom computer letting the teacher know if a student is understanding the lession by their facial expression. If most of the class show a facial expression that they are not understanding the lession the teacher may change the lesson to make sure students learn it. Most students in class room are to shy or pershaps scared to answer or question thinking they will get it wrong, with new technology teachers will know how the students feels about gettin answers wrong or feeling shy in the class room.
