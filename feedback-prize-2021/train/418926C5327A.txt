Dear principal

I think that you should go with your first policy because some students feel that there phone is essential for certain reasons if an emergency happens at your school and they are stuck and there is no way to get to the office to call there parents how would they contact them .having a phone with them could help extremely in a situation like a fire or a break in to the school.

Another reason i think you shouldn't go with the second policy is maybe the students parents would like to check up on them and make them take there to school the parents would get upset and the school would have a problem another reason that i think you should stick with policy 1 is because most students would probably think that's fair to only use during there free time maybe you could confiscate it if there using it in class and return it to them at the end of class or at the end of the day or whatever works best for you but keep it in a teachers desk or something cause if there parents or a friend try's to call or leave a message the students may think its an invasion of privacy or space .

another reason i think you shouldn't use your 2nd policy is because that the students might try to bring them any way and if you took it they would get there parents to come and talk with you giving students a little freedom at school is important to them. and letting them bring there phone is probably the easiest ( and probably cheapest) way to do that. i think its important to students like me to get this privilege at school some students might respect you more if you gave them this opportunity.
