Dear State Senator,

I will like to talk about changing the way that we vote for elections. I want to make voting for president based on a poular vote and not the Electoral College system. The Electoral College system is a meeting of electors where they vote for President, Vice President, and votes by the Congress. In the Electoral College system, voters do not vote for the president. Instead, they vote for a slate of electors who elects the president.

For an example of the system, if you were living in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 electors pledged to John Kerry. If the electors won the election Kerry gets 34 electoral votes. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. These electors are picked by the state and can come from different kind of conventions and party's of and by the state. The system can get very confusing, sometimes the electors dont always for who you want to be elected.

I'm asking to change voting to the most popular vote. This kind of voting is based on qualified citizens and they voting for whom ever they please. I like this system because you have a voice to speak and choose the kind of president you like. The Electoral College system is an unfair, outdated, irrational system. This kind of system is not needed in america from me speaking personally.

A word that would descibe the Electoral College system is anachronism. Anachronism is something that belongs to the past and not in the future. I can't see that kind of system being in our lives forever. Elections based on the most popular vote is good system, but us humans take advantage of that too. We have the power in our hands to change the world around us, but don't do it or use it. Either way based on popular vote is a way better system than the Electoral College system and i will like for our country to use that system.

Sincerely, Student
