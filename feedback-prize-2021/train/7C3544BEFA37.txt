Why i Think Community Service Is Important

I think that all students should have to perform community service. Since it is an important part in life I believe that to graduate from high school community service should be performed. Weather this service is helping the elderly or just going around and picking up trash around your neighbor hood I find that is a good way to help your community.

I agree that all students should have to do community service. One reason I believe this is because it may simply be helping your neighbor hood look better so that you may get new neighbors, and maybe even new friends. Weather or not if you already have somebody doing this in your neighborhood you should still do to help him/her out. If you are busy with other activities such as football or soccer then you need to take the time during the weekend to go around helping your community.

Also you should do community service because it can help you make more friends. community service does this as you may not be the only Pearson in the community working to get a nicer neighbour hood. weather you are just trying to work on your neighbors house by painting it you can help your community's value grow.

Another way you cab help your community is by volunteering at an elementary school so that you could read them a story or tutor them in math. helping younger kids can help not just your community but your nation. This can help your nation as they may just be the one to find the cure for cancer.

So the next time you see a friend working for the community and your just sitting inside playing video games or watching television you should go out side and help them. And maybe they may just help you on something as well. Remember community service is always a great pass time.
