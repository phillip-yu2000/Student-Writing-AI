I am against the cars that drive by there self. I am against this because the car would be operated by a computer and computers have glitches and so forth all the time. Anything could make the car have a malfunction and it could and more than likely will put people at risk. If there was something ahead and you saw it a human would have more time to react than a computer driving a car. I feel as if there would be a lot more wrecks and injuries because the car wouldn't be able to spot the car/person as soon as a human would be able to. I know that accidents are gonna happen with a human driving a car or with a computer driving a car but I feel as if it would be a lot safer with a human. If a lot of accidents were to happen the people that made those cars would more than likely get sued for almost all there money. I wouldn't be against this if we were farther in to the future and they knew and studied more about it. My opinion is that they dont know enough about it yet to make it safe for the environment.
