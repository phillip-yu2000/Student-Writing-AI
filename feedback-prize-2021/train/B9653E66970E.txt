Just A Natural Landform..

The image shown in the capturing photos brought back from Mars revealed something, some call an alien, and others call a natural landform. The image seemed to have caught everyone's attention. As mentioned in the article, it has starred in Hollywood films, magazines, been heard on radio talk shows, and has appeared in books. The images seemed to have reminded people of other natural formations, looking like a natural landform.

Many things like this seem to remind people of other natural formations. Paragraph 12, from the exerpt, states "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Gavin. "Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars." Gavin, like many others thought this formation looked like other natural landforms.

The face is just a natural form. Paragraph seven from the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" also stated "There was no alien monument after all." The same paragraph also included "Thousands of anxious web surfers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing... a natural landform."

I can see why many people would think the natural formation looked much like an alien because, as included in the exerpt, it looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. However, it looked like it was a huge rock formation with a human head formed by shawdows.

The images captured were just revealing a natural formed, that looked like some other natural forms found all other the world. As stated in the article, "The face is just a natural form."
