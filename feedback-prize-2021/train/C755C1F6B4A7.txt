I believe that taking classes from home would have some benefits that are positive and negative more positive though than actually attending school and I have three major reasons why home learning would be more beneficial and less beneficial than what is offered in schools all across fcpsÂ but also I do believe that there are some things only attending school can offer so I will shine some light on that too.

I think that taking classes from home would allow you to have a better sleep schedule since classes usually start later around like 10,When at school it's way more difficult to get that full 8 or 9 hours of sleep because your either up late night studying for test or completing all the homework that some of these teachers give out. The typical 8-2 school days can also be very draining when you don't have the proper sleeping hours but if your classes would start later that would allow you to fully recharge your battery and wake up refresh also working in the comfort of your own bed would make you feel more relaxed and less tired and falling asleep lie most kids do in class.

ven though I agree with the prompt I do want to actually say that taking classes from home would lessen your social activity and there are just some things that only school can offer. The social aspect of school is a big reason and if you take online classes you''ll be missing that interaction with your peers,Which isn't exactly a good thing you are gonna feel more isolated and kinda lonely in a way not seeing your friends that you typically have classes with would have a toll on your mental state because sometimes the only reason kids come to school or attend school is to see your all your friends and even the ones you don't see outside of school. There just some benefits that only school can offer like electives you can't take most electives online like gourmet foods and advanced PE so at the same time school does have some elements too it that set you up for the real world in a way.

Lastly I believe that online courses would just be a better way to teach kids because in most cases the classroom environment is just too much and to overwhelming sometimes early in the morning and in general,I think that working from the comfort of your home would allow you to be more comfortable to ask questions that you usually wouldn't ask in a classroom and you would be more focus since it isn't the pressure being with 29 other students that may get it quicker than you do. When your typically in class and your working on an assignment your teacher is usually going around helping everyone well most kids need a 1 on 1 with just you and the teacher and you normally can't get that so I believe that online courses would give you that 1 on 1 feel and that honestly can make an F turn into an A in some cases,In most colleges though your gonna be in a big classroom withe even more kids so I do think school does get you used to that kinda feel so it isn't all bad with the classroom environment. I also wanna say that sometimes the pacing of some classes can just be too much with quizzes and test every other class and all that studying but in that online class it's gonna feel better since it's a smaller classroom and you feel like there just cramping information into your brain.

In conclusion I believe that home learning is better overall wise but that school does have it's benefits too and that I feel like home learning would kinda make you lazier in a way and that school leaning sets you up for the future more bu at the same time home learning would be way more efficient academic wise since your typically more isolated from your friends and can focus.
