When people ask for advice about something, they sometimes ask more than one person. Asking more than one person has alot of benifits for yourself. It's always good to have multiple choices about something. Second, Everyone has different opinions about situations. Someones advice could be better than somebody's elses.

Having a wide variety of options or choices is always a good thing. Hearing what one person has to say could make the situation worse or it could not help it at all. It's always good to hear what everyone else has to say about a situation your going through. In general, asking more than one person dosen't hurt.

Everyone has different opinions. Listening to more than one person makes you think more about the situation. For example, if your going through something that someone has already been through or is going through, they could relate more to it and give you pointers and also give advice to help you get through it. Someones advice could be a better choice than somebody elses advice. After all, always ask around for help if you need it.

Lastly, someones advice could make a situation worse if you listen to them. Dont always listen to one person. They could easily lie to you and tell you to do something that can lead to serious trouble. For example, if you and a friend were having friend problems and you ask your other friend for help on how to help the situation and they tell you to go fight the friend. You are gonna get a charge while the friend that told you to do it is gonna get no consequenes.

As a result, if the advice someone gives you dosen't seem right don't listen to them and go ask someone else for help.

I strongly agree that asking more than one person for help on a certain situation can make a person make the right choice instead of the wrong one. All in all, asking more than one person for help isn't always a bad thing. It's always good to keep your options open.Â
