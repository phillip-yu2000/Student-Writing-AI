Earlier studies show that there are no alien lightforces on any planet whatsoever. Most people think that aliens hide in the shadows and they will abduct us in our sleep, no. Aliens are another term for forigners or people from other countries, but this was in 1976-2001 when almost everyone believed in aliens. The National

Areonautics Space Administration wasn't created to see if aliens are real or not, is was created to study something in space other than just Earth. Aliens do not excist so there is no possible way that they can make a face of a human from Mars, it is just a natural landform that so happens to look like a face.

The thing about people's imagination is that they'll believe anything that someone tells them. Most people are like brainwashed monkeys about to be tested on. I myself used to believe in "alien lightforces" when I was young. People in the late 1900s were very childish and had creative minds. Why would someone even doubt that the image that was taken isn't just a natural landforce, it would be almost stupid if someone would doubt.

In late June last year some man took a picture of something that looks like a UFO, I can now see how people would thing that aliens are real. However this new age of technology has been so equipped with the use of photoshop. People that can photoshop can control almost half of the worlds' minds. The fact is that since aliens aren't real, there is no possible way that they can make a human face from the Mars dirt. It has to be just a natural landform.
