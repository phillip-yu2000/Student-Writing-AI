Dear principal,

I disagree with your idea for many reasons. First, most students have a C average so most students would not be able to play even if they are the next Michael Jordan. Second, this change would nearly cut the amount of players in half so you would not have as many kids participating in sports. And third, it only hurts the school by not having as much talent on the team.

Most students in the school have a C average, so they wouldn't be able to play. If a kid has outstanding athletic ability and has a C, that is terrible because he wont be able to show maybe his only or best talent he has. Only because he is not getting a high enough average.

This change would also cut the amount of players. It would hurt the school by not having as many people participating in school sports. This amounts to not as many people supporting the team and showing up to games. For example, if someone has a lot of friends his/her friends will come to the games to support them. But then if the player cant play on the team, those friends have nobody to cheer on specifically and wont come.

Lastly, it would only be the school's loss if there is not as many players. If all of the best athletes on the team have a C average, then you don't have as much talent and the team wont do as good. Then the school team wont have a good record because they don't have all of their best talent out there.

Overall, i strongly disagree with this. I think it would have a large effect, but only in a negative way. It would take away talent, and I just don't see any good in doing this. If you can find a reason why this change would help, let me know. I will be surprised if there is a decent reason why to change the policy.
