Dear State Senator

I know you have been thinking about if we should still use "Electoral collage" or changing to election by "popular vote for the president of the United States." I am here to inform you that i believe that keeping the Electoral College may still help us. By having Electoral College you can swing states and biggers states.

To begin with, keeping the electoral college may be a good idea. When having you could swing states. In the passage "In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President" the passage states that "The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates"(paragraph 20) The qoute is explaining that by having candidates from toss up states, the voters would help the elections. The voters would actually be interested in the electon and pay attention to what is happening. Having voters from toss up states may help decide the election.

Second, Keeping Electoal College may benefit us in many ways. If we keep Electoral College than we would bring in bigger states. In the passage its states that " The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution." (paragraph 21) The quote is explaing that when there is a bigger state involved then the larger states would get the most attention from any presidential candidates. Being a larger states give people more of a advantage. An example they gave in the paragraph 21 (5. big states) it explains that "the popular vote was very close in florida(in 2012); nevertheless obama, who won that vote,got 29 electoral votes." the example was explaining that since florida was bigger we got more votes so that lead to Obama winning.

In conclusion,thats why i believe we should keep Electoral College. Electoral Collage would swing states, and involve big states.
