Crock. Sizzle. Pop. you hear these sounds and smell something delicious as you walk down the hallway after school. Most people find that you can benefit from extra curricular activities. We should all do at least one because participating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships, they can give you something to do, and you can find things you love to do.

Participating in extra curricular activities can help you make long lasting friendships. I found my best friend in an art class after school, she now lives in Generic_City and we are closer then ever. I didnt want to go at first but once I found her, it was the only place I wanted to be. I am currently in the school play and I've found so many people that share my interests. I have also made so many new friends and now we do stuff outside of school.

Being in an extra curricular activity can also give you something to do. Before I started them all I would do is sit at home alone being bored, now I have something to do. Even when I'm not there I still do stuff for it, and instead of being bored and alone I can talk to people who are also in my extra curricular's.

When you are in an extra curricular activity you can find things you really love to do. Before I was in any extra curricular's I didnt know I could paint, sing or do anything, I thought i was just a normal boring person. When my mom made me join an art class I realized that loved to paint, and when the summer Olympics of 2012 came on I watched the gymnastics portion and realized I wanted to do that, so I took gymnastics. I'm still taking gymnastics right now. I also found out that I loved theater, I joined a play because of my friend and it turns out that it wasn't so difficult after all.

In conclusion we should all do at least one extra curricular activity. You may find some new friends, something to do, and find something you love. So next time you hear those cracks, sizzles, and pops go check it out.
