My position on driverless cars is I think they are a good idea because it would make long road trips easier on the driver. I say that because if it notifies the driver when something is wrong or they need to take the wheel I think it would make less accidents happen. It has a sensor for when people need to reverse the car and makes noises or vibrates the seat if the car is to close to something. Also in 2013 when BMW annouced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant", the car can handle driving functions up to 25 mph. But the driver has to keep hold of the wheel so the driver would be alert at all the time if they need to take control.

If we have all this stuff on the car like the "Traffic Jam Assistant" sensors for when the car is in reverse and it alerts the driver when they need to take over the accident rates would drop. People wouldnt be so careless when they drove too. Some people get tired of driving or they just want to be on their phone well when they have the driverless car all those probelms would disappear. They would just have to be alert when the car needs them to take the wheel. Driving may sound fun to new drivers but new drivers can be reckless and careless it would definantly drop the accident rates.

The only bad think about the driverless car would be if something failed than it would be the maufactures fault. It is their job to make sure to alert the driver to take over and make sure everything works. But automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved. They are expecting a car that can be on autopilot 90% of the time we just have to drive that last 10%. In 2020 three different cars are expected to be able to drive all by themselves. Making the driverless car better than they expected.
