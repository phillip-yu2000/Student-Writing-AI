Phones and driving

People all over the world have died due to people using there phone while driving to justify that its alright for people to use their phone while driving is wrong people should learn that when your going about 80 in a rolling death box the last thing you need to look at Is your phone.

Just a little over 4000 people in 2018 died or caused death while they were using their phone and driving, that may seem like a small number, but those crashes caused at least $129 billion or 15% of over all societal damage. Driving while on the phone is and should stay illegal it'll cause less death every year and accidents in general, god knows we need to stop having manmade disasters. I feel as if they need to make the law stricter though so people actually learn to stop texting and driving, put them in jail for 5 days or something like that it will for sure make them never want to text and drive again.

Now I know what your going to say "oh but technology today provides hand free phone usage in vehicles" Blasphemy, making it hands free or not it is still distracting the driver that few seconds it takes to either answer the phone or to look at your radio could ruin your life, in fact just play music on the radio and sing along I promise it'll make the car trip more bearable.
