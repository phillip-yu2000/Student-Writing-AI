Can computers really understand our emotions? Details from the article of the use of Facial Action Coding System to read the emothional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becaues it helps us understand emotions, it helps us see true emotions, and it helps us connect with emotions.

My frist support is that it helps us understand. According to the article it can detake mixed emotions. For example the new emotion-recognition software trackes these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. It can also indcated where it is a gerneral smile or a fake smile.

My second support is we can see true emotions. The article staes that in a false smile the mouth is streacted sideways using the zygomatic major. In a real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. So it proves that this tecnonlgy can indicate the differnce between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My last support is that we can connect with emotions. The facial Feedback Theory of Emotion says that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. An example is a drama couch has his students smile and frown to produce those emotions on stage and really feel them.

Details for the article of the use of this techonolgy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becaues it helps us understand emotions, it helps us see true emotions, and it helps us connect with them. This is important becaues some people can't read some emotions and if we can understand them, then we can understand how others feel. Its also important because by understanding emotions we use them more. All of these supports on why this techonolgy is useful and more is why it is very valuable to students.
