Splash! The bucket of paint hits the canvas as soon the extra class starts. I would like to agree with the decision of an extra class for all students to at least participate in one extra activity. An example for an extra class is like to design in the yearbook,learning art,and making new friends.

First of all,designing in the yearbook for the whole school to see would be an outstanding work of art. Helping out for the yearbook could be fun in many ways and taking lovely photos of people as they have fun as well. Doing the yearbook means that the students can also cast a vote on the colors and the font on the yearbook. One of the most important part of the yearbook is the theme, like for spring and summer or even the school mascot.

Secondly, learning art is also fun to have for an extra class and getting to experience a new feeling to learn more about the activity. Having art class could interest other students to join or having art cast their future job. Learning for an extra class can improve on a students skill or there love for art, and to give the students an opportunity to show off their talents for the whole school to see one day.

Third of all, having a new class to go to could help out some students to make new friends and build there trust more. Team bonding is also a way to make new friends and help each other out to learn from each other. Having new friends can also lead into a group project, and build up the trust that students can make. Students can have similar skills, like to paint in the same or close style, and may also think the same idea as one another student has.

Lastly, having an extra event for students is a fantastic idea and making school a bit more exciting to go, giving the students an opportunity to choose what they are going to be in the future. Getting a new generation in the world would save a lot of people and change the future one day.
