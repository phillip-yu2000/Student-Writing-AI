To the Principle,

I believe that students should not be allowed to have cell phones in school. I have many important reasons to why i feel this way.

First of all, some students may use them when they are not suppose to. Others will take advantage of the privilege. They could possibly use them when taking a test for instance.

Some teachers are never fully aware of what their students are doing with their cell phones. This can cause major issues for not just one, but many students.

My second reason is because it is a way of bullying. Many students use technology today to bully others. If we just give students this privilege, then we are giving bullies an easier way to target their victim. Many suicides have come with bullying, and most of it was cyber bullying. Giving those students technology in school may lead to many more, unless we stick to the strict policy of no cell phones in school.

My third most reason would have to be the learning experiences. If they have their cell phones with them then it may take away their learning advantages. Having their phones may lead to them text instead of pay attention in class. If they do not pay attention, then how are they going to challenge themselves to do their best? Letting them have cell phones is taking away what they need to be focusing on, which is school work.

We have kept the policy for a reason. We have seen and heard the nasty things we can do with technology. Imagine letting student have a better advantage to do these nasty things. Please stick to it. If you do decide to let them have their cell phones, you will see what technology can really do to mess up a school. I'm just sending out the warnings before you do change it.

Sincerely,

Students of the School
