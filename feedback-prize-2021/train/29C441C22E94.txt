How can a computer detect how you are feeling? In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D'Alto it talks about a computer program called FACS (Facial Action Code System) can detect how you are feeling. This could be valuable in classrooms because it can help students learn better and be in better moods through out the school day.

In class a lot of students do not care because they are bored or sleepy or in a bad mood. This new technology could help solve that problem for many students worldwide. In the article Dr. Huang says "Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or a painted face...". This quote explains how the computer system could help with students moods. It could also help teachers identify how students are feeling and how to go about approaching them and trying to solve the problem.

If this technology could be put in schools around the world it could lead to school being less frowned upon and become a more positive thing.

Students go to school to learn. But not all teachers teach in a way where all students can understand it. If this new technology could be put into schools there would be less failing students and more college graduates. In the article it says "A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor". The tecnology in schools would be great for students. This could make it a lot easier for teachers as well.

In the article " Making Mona Lisa Smile" it talks about how a computer software call FACS can identify our emotions. This technology could be valuable in schools because it can help students learn better and help them be in better moods.
