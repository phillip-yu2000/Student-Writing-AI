Would you ever ride a horse to work or school? That's a bit out of date , don't you say? Well, why don't we use horses as transportation anymore? In my oppinion, this is because we've adapted from horse transportation. I think, everyday products, such as, cars should always adapt. Therefor, I am for the developement of driverless cars.

According to paragraph nine in "Driverless Cars Are Coming" it states, that states such as, Nevada, California, Florida ,and Distict of Columbia have allowed limited use for these driverless cars. This is good ,because they get to test these cars and fix the potentially spotted flaws. If these cars have been tested accurately , what is the problem?

Essentially, these cars could potentialy save lives. Statistically, texting, drunk driving and sleeping while driving are the topmost factors to fatal car crashes. If we had driverless cars, I feel confident that the death rate in this catagory will decrease. Futeristic automakers are under the assuption that the problems ahead will be solved, According to paragraph ten in "Driverless Cars Are Coming". This year, Tesla has relesed a car that pilots 90 percent of the vehical, according to paragraph ten in " Driverless Cars Are Coming". Within 2020, Benz , Audi, and Nissan will have an offer on driverless cars. In order to adapt, these cars need to be given the chance to succeed.
