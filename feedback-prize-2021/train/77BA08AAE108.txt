What do i think about the principal changing the policy on playing sports and interacting with other activities is not so wise, because in my eyes its not a good thing.

Some of the reasons i say its a bad thing is that there are some kids out there that use sports as there life long dream but now that they cant do as good as they want to in school and that puts them in a position where they cant play or interact with these other activities, but some people also use sports to push themselves in school just to play in other activities and sports. Also some more idea's that first pop up in my head is that some kids play sports with D and C and still play in other activities they could just stop doing the other activities, and sports that they have been doing.

Some good reasons why this could be a good thing, one way that this could help the school out is having these kids that play sports and interact with other activities. Is that when they're doing these sports and other activities they can know that there doing this with good grades and that is one good thing about it. Then also it also can get the pressure off you because you now that you are going to have to show a report to some every week, and you know that you have a b or better.

So what do i think is that this policy about having a better grade to be able to play in sports and other activities is smart for the school but not so fun for the students and not saying that its good to have a D or C in your class and put that pressure on yourself. So in some peoples eyes they could see different than mine but that's what i think.
