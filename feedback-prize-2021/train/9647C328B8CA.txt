Dear, Principal

I don't think that its fair for all the students to have a B average because no one is perfect , and in some classes it might b hard to another student n there best grade might just be a C and that's the only C they have like in math or something and its not right for a student to not play a sport if the rest of there classes are good like with all A's all B's and that little C is messing them up ,I know that athletes suppose to set an good example but like i said everybody's not perfect so i don't think that its right to not let students participate in sports because of a C . But i do think that they should not be able to participate in anything if there grade is lower than a C average . But i hope that you really think about this new school policy because , maybe some really good athletes might not be able to play because of this rule if they only have one C in a class , and i hope that you don't change this rule because that's not fair to some people because they might have tried there really best to keep there grades up but then again its just that one little grade that's stopping them from doing a sport just because you wanting to change the rule . But i just really hope that you think about it and don't change the rule . And that's why i think you shouldn't change the rule.
