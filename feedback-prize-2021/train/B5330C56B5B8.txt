I think that Lukes point of viewIf you were going to ask someone to do it then you would it might change your life. In the article is that he his a little nervous that he will be going on a ship for a long time. And he wanted to got out on sea and see what it was like.

He said that it will not be good that if he gets injured then you will have to stop working and that is bad! He said that it was a little bit bad when you hurt your self and you can't work anymore.

He said in the passage that he said that he was thankful that the metal rail saved him from going overboard. He said that was in the text was that there was more things to do like playing baseball. soccer. volleyball,and those other sports too. That is what i think that the point of view for luke is.
