Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you shouldn't require all students to perform community service. I think that would be very unfair of you and selfish to do that to your students. Yeah you might think that its for their best interest and it would look good on our college resseme and all, but some people just don't have the time for it.

For example my family and I are very busy, from running my little brother to taekwondo and football, and from me having basketball practice after school. You have to be considerate about people and their lives, to me its like you would be playing GOD with us.

Also, here's another reason why we shouldn't be required to perform community service. We are middle school students we have homework, projects and test to study for. would you really want to interfere with that? Really think about that question.

Finally why we shouldn't be required to that stuff is that we are young, we need to enjoy our youth years why we can! Let us have fun before we grow up and have to pay bills and all that other non sense that you "adults" have to do.

I really do hope when you read this letter, that you really think about what i have to say. Thank you for hearing me out.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
