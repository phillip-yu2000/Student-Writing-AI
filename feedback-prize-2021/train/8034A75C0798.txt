Cellular phones are not to be used in the driver seat. In this essay, I will explain how drivers should not be able to use cellular phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. People in the world today are glued and stuck to their cellular phones because of this world being technology driven. Cellular phones are now smart phones, literally walking computers.

That's wonderful in its place; however, putting your life and others lives in danger while using cellular phones while driving is the issue of today.

The numbers showing the danger of cellular phones used while driving a vehicle are very scary. In fact, at any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their cellular phones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and 3,328 people were killed during the year of 2018 which was the most during 2018- 2020.

A vehicle needs your undivided attention because you are not driving for yourself, you are driving for others. People get very distracted by things such as texts, calls, or even music. In my opinion, this generation cannot multitask so they put their mind on one thing and stick to that. This is usually the cellular phone and not the road while driving the vehicle.

In my conclusion, life is more important than a text or a Direct Message when driving a motor vehicle. We shouldn't just think about ourselves, but think about other drivers on the road, and help everyone get back home safe and sound to their loved ones.
