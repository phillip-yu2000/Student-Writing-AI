Dear Principle,

I think that it is a great idea for students to do community service! I think it is a great way for students to help protect our environment and help the next generation to be even smarter than this one. This is a good way to keep children from playing video games all day. This will make our community much more pretty but also more successful. This way it will stop students from littering because they will see how much there is and how hard it is to pick up all of the trash. Plus, it will help the students become better citizens now and in the future. Friends could talk to each other while helping the environment at the same time instead of talking over some online gaming system like X Box or Play Station. They could get exercise for their whole body instead of just their fingers. If we teach elementary school students we can get to know some of the teachers better as well as some of the students. We could also learn something new about ourselves while we are tutoring the younger elementary school children. One last thing is that the students will learn that everything isn't just about themselves, but about the whole community we all live in. As you can see I am in favor for us students to do community service. The only problem is that it might conflict with extra curricular activities such as sports or competitions. If we can find a way to get the community service not to interfere with activities other students are participating in I think that this will be a very successful idea.

Sincerely,
