However, those decisions can come to weather someone goes to Venus could come back with great results of experiments that NASA is researching.

The atmosphere of Venus is a dangerous enviornment for human kind to be in. " ...(T)empertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth..." This shows that Venus' tempertures have the risk of a scientist unable to survive in the atmosphere.

NASA, however, is coming up with ways to send a scientist to Venus with a safer way of getting information. "... (A) vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way... Not easy condtions, but survivable for humans." This reveals that there is still a chance that a scientist can go to Venus with not much to worry about.
