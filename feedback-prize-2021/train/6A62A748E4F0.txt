Do you agree or disagree that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity? Well i believe that all students must be part of an extracurricular activity because it creates bonds and builds teamwork skills.

Extracurricular activities create bonds by forcing students to join with one another in a group project so they will make friends among the group. Students will be able to further improve their passion for the activity for example I found out about the D&D club at my school I went to one of their sessions and found out that I really had a passion for the game, I am still enjoying it to this day.

Extracurricular activities build teamwork skills by making students work together to get a task done. For example when I was in D&D me and my group were in a forest when we saw a dead horse on the road two of my teammates were squinting to try and see the details, another one of my teammates was booking it to the horse to try to see what happened and I'm just standing their thinking to my self what are these nut jobs doing then suddenly the teammate who was booking it got jumped by goblins I forced a fire bolt at one of the goblins, one of my other teammates is playing ping pong with his short bow, another one puts a knife in a goblins back, the paladin smashes his hammer on one of them, and the wizard throws acid at one we took them all out but the one who booked it died the end.

What should have been taken away from this is that being part of an extra curricular activity helps make bonds and encourage teamwork skills, do you agree or disagree that studets must be in a extracurricular activity.
