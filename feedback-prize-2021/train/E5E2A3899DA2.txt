Dear principal,

I think that we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and free time because of emergency situations.

If a student forgets something like homework or other school related things they should be able to use there own phone to call and let their parents know that they forgot something and need them to bring it into school for them.

Another reason is if they are in any kind of after school activity and times or plans change or they need a ride home they can use their phone during a free period to let them know what is going on.

If they do that they do not have to waste class time worrying if their parents know and using the school phone.

Also, if there is a family emergency then the student's parents can get a hold of them faster to let them know what is going on.

This could be faster than calling the school.

This is also a good idea if a student has health issues they can let their parents know what is wrong with them and if they should be sent home by the nurse.

Plus, the nurse may not know what to do in a certain situation so they could talk to the parents on the student's cell phone.

My last reason is communication if we do not communicate with our fellow students then we don't know what is going on in other classes.

We may have a test that is hard and we can remind others to study.

That is why we should be able to use cell phones during lunch and free time.

If these reasons are not good enough you should still give the students a change.

Make it clear that they should have them off before entering a class where they should not be on.

Give punishments and rules of what they can and cannot do with the phones.

Yours Truly,

STUDENT_NAME
