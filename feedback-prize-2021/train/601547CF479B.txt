I beieve that we should change the election to popular vote. It's about what the people want and what the majority of the people would like. You would not want people getting a President or Vice President that they do not like their beliefs on how to run a country, or despise to an extended amount. It's not right for the President and Vice President to say a bunch of things and not go through with it to the people. You shouldn't have only a few people vote or the President and not have your own opinion in the say of things.

People can get confused and vote for the wrong elector and not know what they really did. They can get confused and vote for he wrong candidate then the next thingt you know is that you have somebody running your country and you don't like the decisions they make and what they're doing to America.

Also, if there were to be a tie in the voting, they would have to chose the House of Representatives to vote for the President which could cause problems. In each state since they have representatives depending on the population, they wouldn't get the right amount of people to vote if it depends on how many voters are in the election. So it wouldn't be fair or even in that sense. It's not fair to the people of the country.

It's not certain that you will get the right vote because if you go off of electors votes which have completely opposite opinions from you. Electors that have different opinions can lead to voting for somebody who has no hope of carrying their state or country. People who know their vote may have no effect on the country would be unlikely to vote.
