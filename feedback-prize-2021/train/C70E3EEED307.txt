Dear, Principal I disagree that students should have a grade b average to be in sports, most students have a grade c average. So most students would not be able to be in sports or other events and the students here would not like that idea. And if the student have to have a grade average of a b they would be trying to hard to keep up with there school work, and then they wouldn't be able to do sports or any other events that occur in this process. If students had the average of a grade c then they wouldn't have to worry about the school work or any homework that they would have to do right away. They could have much more experience in their sports or other events. If the principal was to make that a rule their wouldn't be hardly anybody in that sport or event. They would all have to be in something different, or not be in anything at all. Think of all the people that love being energized and love doing sports or even other thing that involve school. But if there grades had to be really good to do that they wouldn't be able to do so. Most teens age around 13 or 14 have grade c averages, and they would be able to be in sports but other kids ages 12 and under don't always have perfect grades and they wouldn't be able to participate in sport or other school activities. As you see here i am in the 8th grade and probably only have a c average and I am in choir and

I enjoy it very much, but if the rule was to have a b average i wouldn't be able to be in the choir. And as you should know I am very against this we should not have to have a grade average of a b to be in these sports or events in this school. Therefore I am writing this to inform you that we should be able to do sports or any other events with a c average.

Thank y
