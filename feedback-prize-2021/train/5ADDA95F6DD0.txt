Dear principal,

I think we should all be required to do at least 3 hours of community service. It would be a great way for everyone to get involved in their community and help others. It looks good if you have community service on your college application. This can help you with your life goals and make you a better person.

We can tell the students about this in a way that makes it sound exciting like giving examples which makes it easier. We could say,' you can clean up trash in your neighborhood with your friends'. This might make it sound more exciting if you say you can do it with a friend. They can also help out at a daycare or assisted living center with their friends too.

Some of the kids say that they don't have time to do community service but they can make time. We can explain to them how they can complete their homework, do sports and other things and still do community service. We can give them tips on how to manage time and be responsible. I hope you take this letter into consideration.

Your student,
