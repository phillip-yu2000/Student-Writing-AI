Dear Principal,

I think that having students perform community service is a good idea. It can be beneficial to them in many ways and it is good for the community. I will tell you why I think having students perform community service is a good idea.

First off, having students perform community service helps them gain respect in the community. The adults of the community will see the students as being good for their community and not as a pest or troublemaker if they perform community service. The students will have an easier time growing up and being accepted in the community If they did community service as a child and the adults appreciate it.

Next, I think having students perform community service teaches them values. If they perform community service when they are young, they will most likely keep on when they are older and be a good part of the community. People who tutor kids when they are younger may go and be a teacher when they grow up. Students can perform community service in the field they want to work in when they grow up. If a student wants to be a scientist, he can help his science teacher or help at the lab.

Finally, I think having students perform community service is good because it keeps them out of trouble. If a student likes to graffiti buildings, he might stop because he or one of his friends might end up cleaning it. It also keeps students busy, so they will be less likely to get involved in gangs and drugs.

I think making students perform community service is a good idea for these reasons. It helps them gain respect in the community, teaches them values and keeps them out of trouble. A student can make a difference on his own, but making him perform community service helps them make a difference.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
