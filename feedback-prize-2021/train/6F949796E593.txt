i agree that all students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity

Because you can try something new and you can pick what you want to do and meet new people and make more friends. You can learn new skills and learn how to cooperate with people. The best choice are sports because they let you push yourself also there fun. If you get super good at the sports you can do it as a job and get a lot of money. The other best one is helping the school out like work on the yearbook or help clean up. Or you can do art,soccer,football,golf and many more.

There a lot of reason why doing activity are good for you it make you more active it makes you work harder and smarter. some of the activity can become your life job and you be good at it. its mostly sports.

They the reason why i agree with the principal and why you should do extracurricular activity it help you out with skills and help you cooperate with people. if you dont do extracurricular activity go out and try some.
