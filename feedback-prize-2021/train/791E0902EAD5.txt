Dear principle, I don't think all of the students should have to do community service. I don't think all kids should do community service because I find that as a punishment for doing something bad. I don't believe all students should have to do community service because prisoners of jail have to sometimes do that. Or other naughty teenagers have to do that. So I don't believe good teenagers have to pick up trash or have to do any other subjects like that. Plus if a student signed up for football every day after school from 3-5 pm and community service is from 3-4 pm. What do the parents who paid all that money do know? The football organization doesn't give it back. The parents are out of that money and the child inst playing football which the money went to in the first place. So really it would be affecting the parents and the parents wouldn't be happy with you.

On the other hand if the students don't have any after school activities to participate in that would be a whole another story. If the students didn't have any after school activities to go to then nobody would be super mad except for maybe the students. If you made everyone do community service then all you would hear around the students is moaning and groaning from the students that don't like doing the community service. Student will eventually would want those after school activity's back and the kids will go to there parents and there parents will go to you asking what happened to those after school activity's?

AN alternative solution would be having a sign up sheet for kids and adults to sign up on if they wanted to do community service. Such as picking up liter and help tutoring children that need extra help in some that they may need help in.
