Driving with phones

Driving with phones has been a problem going on for a while. People have been arguing whether you should be allowed phones or not while in control of a moving vehicle, you should not be allowed to drive while on your phone because that distracts you from focusing on the road and all the traffic infront of you. You would be more focused on what's happening on your phone rather than what's going on in front of youon the road which could end up in you getting into a bad wreck and hurting yourself or even someone else. It would also end in you getting charged for it because you aren't allowed to have any distractions while driving. When you think og driving with phonesyou should only think of bad things because it never usually ends well if you are on the phone while also in control of a vehicle.
