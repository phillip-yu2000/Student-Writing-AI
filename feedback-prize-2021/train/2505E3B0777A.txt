Driverless cars are not a smart idea. The car could have some type of technical difficulty and could stop working correctly and cause an accident. The cars have many items in them to make it work they could cost a lot of money and many people would not be able to afford them. It would be a waste of products to produce them.

If people still have to pay attention to the road and sometimes had to drive the car then there is no point to these cars. It would be like driving a normal car. Most places dont let people do computer testing cars. If cars became totally driverless most places in the world would not allow the cars to be driven there. The cars could have technical issues on the road and cause an accident. If some of the sensors stopped working while driving no one would no until something happens or a pedestrian gets hurt.

Driverless cars are not safe ideas. There are many things that could go wrong while using one. The cost of one could be to much. They would only cause more trouble and accidents on the road. Many places would not allow them.
