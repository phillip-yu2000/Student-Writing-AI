Dear principal,

I can understand why you may consider this change in our school policy, but don't believe it's the right thing to do. Yes, it is important for students to have good grades but when you take away something that a person has a love for, it may do the opposite of improving grades. It may make that student feel helplessly stressed out, it may make them not care anymore, or it could make them lose their self -confidence.

First, a student may be having some problems at home and sports are their way of feeling batter or getting that stress out. If you clamp down on that person and take away their outlet, that could result in the student feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. I know from personal experience that when I walk into school after a big fight with my mom, I feel like crap, but knowing that I have basketball to look forward to I can make my way through the school day.

Second, it could make a person not care anymore. This is something you want to avoided. When someone doesn't have much to look forward to they could just give on themselves. Again I know from personal experience. I was felt so depressed because of all the drama at home and that I didn't feel like I was getting en if it hadn't been for the fact that I was a good student my grades would have dropped dramatically.
