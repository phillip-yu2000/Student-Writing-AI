Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Although I do think that it really depends whether or not the student will take the classes seriously or will play around with the free extra time. I think it would still be beneficial.

For example,if a student wants to participate in an extra curricular activity that requires traveling the student can't do that unless he or she is taking classes online. However,If a student decides to take online classes but does not take extra activities then there is no reason for he or she not to attend regular school. For example, I personally struggle with this issue. I take modeling and acting as an extra activity outside of school. Being signed to an agency is hard because that requires me to travel to different states. Meaning I miss a lot of days in school, which makes it even harder because when I come back from a trip I'm usually behind and confused in classes. Although, I do miss a lot of school I still manage to pass and have good grades in my classes by self advocating for myself and explaining,and working something out with my teachers. However I do think that if I was in online school I would be able to travel more and have plenty more jobs. While still being enrolled in the school system. This is why I think that schools should offer distance learning options. It would really be helpful for students with extra Activities.
