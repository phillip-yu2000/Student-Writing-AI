Summer porjects should be designed by the students because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that.

Not all students understand a project the same, some need extra help understanding the project, everyone has a different mindset. Students would make the project at their own pace, others would make the project fun and not a long and boring one, since its summer it should all be about doing fun things, they would actually understand it since its their own, and they wouldn't hate it as much.

After a long school year students need a break from all of the studying and work they been doing in school, some students have stress from all of the projects that the teachers leave them and they would appreciate to do a project of their own and not a boring project, some others may suffer from anxiety which means a painful or fearful uneasiness of mind usually over an impending or anticipated event,other students might actually enjoy doing a project for once since its their own.

Students usually get summer jobs, since they want to make money of their own since they can't becasue they are busy with school. While doing their project they would bring stuff from their work depending where they work at, and since its theirs they wouldn't have to work hard and maily focuse in makijng the money they need, they may be working to save up money for college since its extremely expensive or help their parents pay the bills its good to start paying bills at a young age.

This is why students should make their summer projects and not the teachers because the students would make it better to understand, teachers would give us boring projects and we need the mental break in the summer, and students get summer jobs so they need to focus on that and to be honest majority of the students aren't going to do the project regardless if they make it or if the teachers make it since its summer.
