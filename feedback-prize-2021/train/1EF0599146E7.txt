Dear Principle,

I think that students should have to perform community service hours. There are so many problems and sad nesses in this world that with even just a little help could be better. For example recycling, many people throw away plastic bottles everyday. This builds up and destroys our beautiful environment. With students help we could help inspire people to recycle and give out recycling bins to people around the community. We also have many tragedies everyday that put people at a loss. For example tornadoes destroying peoples homes. With students help we can rebuild new homes and even wash clothes for those who don't have them. While doing this students would not only giving the people a good home and making them happy ,but making the world a better place and setting a good example for others to help out. We already have wonderful volunteering businesses in the United States today that many students could help improve. So as you can see there are so many ways that students can make a big impact on the whole world. Kids could even just help by going from door to door in their neighborhood selling things such as magazines to raise money for charities. For all the wonderful things we have on earth it's really not to much to ask of someone to help out. Thank you for considering my thoughts.

Sincerely,
