I think policy 1 is better because some students need their phones for important things. They should let everyone do that because not all students will call someone while they are at school because it is not appropriate. I think that my principal should give us a try just for one day to see how it would turn out but if we do good then we could do it as a privilege but if we are really bad then we could go back to the rule where we cant bring them. The only time that they wont be able to use them during class because we need to pay attention in class to do good on the TAKS test. I think that it would get the children to behave more so that they could use their phones on their free times. If it doesn't I don't know what will because I know that I would always do good with or without it. Sometimes that is what it takes to make them act better to reward them with things that will make them want to behave in class and in the hallways.

I think that the only reason they act bad at times is because they are bored and have nothing else to do. If I were a principal I would try it to see how things change if it makes great changes I would keep it that way, but if it is worse then i would change the rule back and they wont be able to bring them at all. I would hope and pray that it would work out well and not get worser than what it is. I like to see people happy because it makes me feel happy inside and out too. So, please, please, please give us a shot at it!!! But if you don't I understand that it is your decision because you don't want to take any chances just incase it gets worse but it would be very nice of you if you did.
