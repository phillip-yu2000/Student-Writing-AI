The seagoing cowboy's sounds like a great program.

You get to see new and diffrent things when your in it.

You also get to go on a long ship/ boat ride.

If i were a boy i'd love to do the seagoing cowboy's program.

You may not but we all have our own opinion's.

What he did was very nice, and put himself in a great spot in life.

He didn't only help himself he helped others.

Luke sounds happy and that's what most people want at least that's what i want, so if you like seeing new and bueatiful things you'll want to do this.

Luke didn't really have a choice. He had no idea that his life would change when he graduatated from high school.

He was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldn't say no, he knew it was a opportunity of a lifetime.

Luke is intersting he didn't want his life to go where it was going but if you do the right and great things. The right and great things will come back to you.

And that is what happened to Luke he was doing the right thing and one or two will or did come right back.

They did have to fight for there country but it wasn't just there's it was for others also.

This was a very imformational artice about if you do the right thing it comes right back, and if you can also in this article it did.
