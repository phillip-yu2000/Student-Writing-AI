I agree with having students do extracurricular activities after school, I feel like it would be a good idea to have not every student but, students that will participate involved in some of the extracurricular activities. This could help the students that get into bad things outside of school do better for themselves.

I feel that the students would have fun and would enjoy their time doing the activities provided for them. I agree with students participating in extracurricular activities but, I don't think every student should be involved in the activities for the simple fact, all students do not participate in the activities, in my opinion the activities the principal is providing for the students should be a privilege.

I think one of the activities should be homework club, for the students that need to catch up on work that is pass due or things the students may need help on. Without good grades us students shouldn't be able to have the privilege to be participating in the fun things until our grades are better.

We should have different things for the activities so everyone can try new things, in case they never seen it or tried it and end up liking one of the activities provided.

Another reason i agree is that, some of the students like being after school instead of going home or maybe the students that are going through things at home can stay and do the activities and have fun, I have a list of things that i think would be good activities for students such as basketball football step team/dance team music/rap/sing band practice soccer softball/baseball acting

The activities should be a fun experience but also a learning experience, the students should have fun and learn from it as the have fun doing the activities. Hopefully the extracurricular activities should have the students more active, productive, engaged, and more than happy to stay for more activities.
