Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly agree with the fact that community service is important, But I do not think that students should be forced to partake in community service. For instance, some students may be behind in their studies at school, they would have a less time to do their homework if they had community service to do. with that work to do, they would be up all night trying to do the homework they barely understand.

Another big reason you shouldn't force students to do community service is because not everyone doing community service is a good person. I say this because when someone commits a crime, such as rape, murder, theft, and other crimes, they do not always get sent to jail, they are sentenced to do a certain number of hours for the community. Therefore, some students may meet some bad role models, and some may be influenced by what these people say and grow up to be a bad person. Also, some students may be harmed by these people, which is never good. I'm not saying that all the people that commit crimes and are sentenced to community service are horrible people around kids. But there is a big chance that they could be.

What I'm really trying to tell you is, community service is definitely important, but we should let the students that volunteer and enjoy doing community service do community service, and not force students that may not want to do it otherwise. Some of these kids could be very bitter towards the needier side of our community. You should definitely make it seem fun for kids to do it. You could also hand extra credit points to people that do the community service if they need to get better grades and have no where else to get extra credit.

Regards,

A Student
