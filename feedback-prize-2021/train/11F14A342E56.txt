My opinion for this school is Policy 1. I think it should be policy 1 because, sometimes friends can't talk to each other during school, so if you let them use there phones they could stay best friends or buddies. Another reason why i think we should use phones is, people get bored at lunch so they should be able to text or listen to music on there phone, because we sit at school for 8 hours anyway. I have two more reasons why we should be able to use our phones at school, what happened if you left your lunch at home, and you don't have money in your lunch account or what if you left your clothes for gym or for sports pictures. We should at least be able to listen to music during lunch, because its not going to distract or disrespect someone. That's why we should be able to listen to music and use our phones during school. Kids can still learn during school, because there not wasting teachers time, there wasting there free time.
