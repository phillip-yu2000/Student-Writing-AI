I think many people would love doing the seagoing cowboys program. If you are a country type of person or even a city person you could still do it. I am about to tell a few reasons you should do it. Here are some If you like animals, if you like exploring, if you want money, and even if you like to try new things, this would be a great thing for you.

the first reason is if like animals you would love this job. We take care of cattle. You get to feed them, brush them, clean their stall, and even lead them off the boat. You have to take care of almost 335 horses plus hay and oats to feed them.

Also if you like to explore the world around you this would be a good opportunity to do so. We have visited Europe, China, and other places. I seen the Acropolis in Greece, I took a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the panama Canal on my way to China. There are some other reasons to join the program.

Another reason is you could get paid. You could get payed by the trip or you can get paid every hour. I do not know how you get paid or how much you get paid. All I know is if you want money then join this program.

The Second to last reason you might like this is because we travel far distances. If you like to travel you should do this. It took me and my crew about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Even if you do not like long distance trips caring for the animals will keep you busy.

The last reason is we can still have fun by playing games in our spare time. Me and my crew play Volleyball, Baseball. Table-Tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

I hope you read this and thought it through. I am glad you took time to read this, and hope to see you on one of my trips. We will have fun orking with the animals together. Hope to see you There!!!
