Have you ever thought your choice wasn't the best? Not feeling like your did the right thing can cause a lot of anxiety. So, a way to release yourself from that endless regret is asking for other people's opinions. Asking other people for their opinion can help you make a better decision because others can point out certain things you missed and it causes you less anxiety.

To begin, people think differently, so they can point out things you may have missed. They can prove a point that you didn't even know existed in the situation. For example, if I was stuck trying to figure out if I should get the gray or white sweatpants for when I go horseback riding. So, I ask a friend which color I should get, and they point out that the white sweatpants would probably get dirty and disgusting, so I should just get the gray ones instead. Right there is a prime example of something I didn't even think about and in the end they ended up helping me make the right decision.

Lastly, it causes less anxiety for you to feel like you made absolute best decision. Feeling like you've made the wrong decision can cause a lot of stress and anxiety for a person. Almost enough to swallow you whole! That's why asking for another opinion is beneficial for you and your anxiety. Having a second opinion really does help!

In conclusion, seeking other people's opinions help big time in the long run. Asking for others opinions release a lot of weight off your shoulders. Multiple opinions help someone make a better choice because it causes less anxiety and other people can point out somethings you didn't notice. So next time your in a slump make sure to ask for another opinion.
