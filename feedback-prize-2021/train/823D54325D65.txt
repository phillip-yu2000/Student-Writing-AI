Dear Principal,

I have read the two policy's you are considering. I honestly think policy 1 would work a lot better than 2. There are many reasons why i believe that but i will just give you a few. One of the main reasons is because most students wouldn't even listen to policy two. They would continue to bring their phones anyways. Now matter what you say there will always be some people that won't listen. You also have to think about the students who use their cell phones to call their parents to tell them they are staying after school for tutoring or to have them pick them up. Another reason why policy 1 would be good is because students would do what they need to during lunch or free time. Not spending class time trying to text and spend even more time trying to not get caught. If the students are allowed to have it out at a certain time there wouldn't have to mess up their record and get referrals for having their phones out at lunch. Another thing is that a lot of students don't even use their phone to text or talk during school. A lot if us just use it as our ipod or any music player. So we get in trouble for that? For listening to music during lunch? I think that really dumb. Making the parents have to come back to their kids school just to get their kids phone doesn't make the parents very happy either. They just have to waste they're time and gas to go get the phone. Phones should also be allowed during test. Like i said a lot of people use it for the music. They would have to have their phone in their pocket but be allowed to have earphones. A lot of people, including me, work better when they have music that they like on. Its helps me concentrate and calms me down. So, those are some of the reasons why I believe policy 1 would turn out a lot better than policy 2. I hope that reading you helped you make your decision. It might help to have a students point of view on these things.

Sincerely,

One of your students
