If my principal was reconsidering the cell phone policy, my answer would be to not allow them.

What would you do if you were in this situation?

Hopefully, you would say "NO cell phones allowed in school."

In result of cell phones allowed, would be kids not learning anything because they were on their cell phone.

The principal should not let students use they cell phones because they would get out of hand with it and start using them everywhere, even in the classroom.

Another reason is students would be talking on the phone and texting which will be disturbing to the other classes that are present when their in the library or lunch.

If the principal lets the students bring cell phones with them to school and let them use it, it's like the principal does not like his/her job or is just lazy.

Another thing that would happen if cell phones were allowed would be teachers seeing students grades falling from A' s to B' s or C' s to D' s.

If that started happening the parents would start getting interested with what's happening with their grades.

The parent would probably go to the school and complain about their son/daughters grades falling.

The principals response would not be anything, the real answer is that he/she allowed cell phones in school.

That is what i would think would happen if cell phones were allowed.

The principals choice should be "NO, cell phones allowed at all on school property unless after school hours."

If this wasn't the choice, like i said before it would be like fun time all the time for the students.

It wouldn't even be like school.

That is why no cell phones should be allowed on school property.
