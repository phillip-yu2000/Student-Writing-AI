Hey, have you ever wanted to go sight seeing?

well you can now if you make the best choice by participating in The Seagoing Cowboys program it will take you to very wonderful and unique places. It allowed me experience adventures that I've have enjoyed and I hope you will to. Once you join the program

When I first graduted high school I worked two part time jobs. I worked at a bank and a grocery store. Then my friend Don reist asked me if I wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no this was an opportunity of a lifetime.

The time was 1945 world war II was over. It left a lot of countries in it worst time. I decided to help these people. First we recovered their food supplies, animals, and anything else they needed. Then 44 nations joined together and made the UNRRA aka The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation. THey hired "Seagoing Cowboys" of the animals that were shipped over seas Don and I signed up

So in closing if you sign up you can go see the world and help people at the same time. Who wouldn't want to do that? If you ever wanted to help people or see the world it can be very very easy. It will be the best thing that ever happend to you
