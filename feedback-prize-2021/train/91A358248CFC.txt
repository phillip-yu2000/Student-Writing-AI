Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Some even use their phones while driving. This is dangerous and causes one fourth of the accidents in America. These accidents cause people to get seriously injured or even die. Texting while driving should not be allowed.

Driving is already dangerous enough as it is, but when you add people texting while there driving it adds a whole new level of danger. People should have their eyes on the road and not on their phone. By texting and driving they are putting themselves and everyone else on the road at risk. When people are driving they tend to focus on their phones instead of the road which can be a real threat to others.

Advancements in technology have helped drivers develop a less need for using their phones. Most cars made today are developed with technology to let drivers make phone calls or text without even looking away from the road or picking up their phone. They can now use speech-to-text or accept phone calls through their vehicle.

Phones and driving have become a bad combination that usually leads to someone getting hurt. They can be injured or even die. Drivers should not be able to use phones and drive.
