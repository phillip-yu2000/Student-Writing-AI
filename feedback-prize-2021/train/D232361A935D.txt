Dear Editor

My Principal is Considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average .

Well i agree with my principal because almost about 50% of students in the school are not making a grade b average . Some of the students making a grade F average and that's not good if you in sports or any other activities making that kind of grade average . So you must make an higher grade than a grade F average or you would be left behind and the same grade again . I remember when i where in the 3rd grade and i was doing so good i mean making excellent grade averages an A and B average then i start lacking on my work i didn't want to finish my work so i begin to make an grade C and D average an i barely knew anything when FCAT

came around i were stuck on every little thing . I tried my best on every mutiple choice question and when it was time for the results to come back guess what happen ? i didn't make it to the next grade .

Now i begin to study everyday and work harder and har
