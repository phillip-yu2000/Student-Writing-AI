In this story the author talks about the many diffcultes we would have on studying Venus. The Author also has some good points on what we could do to study venus even though it may be hard to accomplish for the reasearchers.

Now venus has a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon and has clouds that are highly corrosive of sulfuric acid. And on the surfuce of venus the temperature averages above 800 degrees. The environment could crush a submarine and liquefy many metals.

Venus would be worth studing because it's the most like earth. Now with studying venus we would need a ship that could hover over the plant but it wouldn't give us much insight. Reasearchers cannot take the samples that they need. Reasearchers are working to make innovations to are machines so they can last longer on venus and gain the knowledge of Venus. The need to make are Mechanical parts more resistant to pressure,heat and other forces.

So it would be great if we could study Venus it would be worth it even with the dangers. If we can make are systems more reliable in dangerous situations. and we sould be able to explore on eartha nd beyond without worring about the dangers we can face our the doubts we may have we should try to meet the edges of innovation and imagination.
