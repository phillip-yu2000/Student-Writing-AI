Dear Principle,

I think that kids should be allowed to have their phones out during lunch or any other free time. If kids do take advantage of having phones out during class and texting other classmates or texting inappropriate then they shouldn't be able to have there phones out during lunch or other free times. That doesn't mean you should punish everyone.

One reason kids should be able to have there phones out during lunch time is because some kids have to text or call parents about tutorials after school or after school practice because if you have after school practice for track and your suppose to go and practice at the high school and the weather is getting bad you would have to call/text your parents to tell them your not going to practice or your going to stay at the school until whatever time the coaches say, also if you have to stay for tutorials after school and the teacher tells you during class then how is your parents going to know to pick you up or not.

Another reason is because some kids have medical conditions that call for medicines, insulin, or anything else that will help, but not all kids wanna go to the office and call every time he/she needs them, so that's why we should be allowed to have phones out during lunch or other free times.
