A lot of scientists think that the Face was created by aliens. I know that it is just a natural landform. They have no evidence that there is aliens on Mars but they say aliens made the Face.

First, I feel this is just a natural landform because why would aliens just attempt to make a human face. They have no reason to because they don' t know what we look like. Even if there is aliens then they wouldn't make a face of human's for no reason. The passage states that they made an emourmous head, but why would they make a sculpture of a head and not the whole body. If the alien's actually knew what we look like then why would they only make a head.

Next, honestly the pictures that these people got overtime doesn't even look like a human face. It looks like a bird that has just fading away. Speaking real it's just a natural landform. It could be a crater or the wind just chipped away at it. It would be cool if the aliens made the sculpture but none of those people have clear evidence or proof that alien's made this.

Lastly, on the high definition picture it could be a reflection of some kind because the place where the eyes are supposed to be it is black. Also, on the right side it looks like they cut it off because that is not easy to see. The right side looks like a straight line. So, erosion could have eroded the right side off of the natural landform. The picture shows that there is craters beside "the Face" this is a big clue to me that the lanform is natural.

To examplify, this would be practically impossible to say because they are assuming that alien's did this when it could honestly be anything. It would make most sense to be a natural landform because even on Earth there are natural landforms that look like objects or animals. This is why i think it's a natural landform.
