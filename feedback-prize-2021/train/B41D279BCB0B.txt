This to my state senator and I wanted to talk about the favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The reasons to change to elction by popular vote is because under the elctoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Also, the Elctoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

The reason why you change to elction by popular votes is because under the elctoral college system voters vote not for the president, bur for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. There's been argument about this change. For example, the single best argument against the elctoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. This can turn in to the 2000 fiasco when was the biggest election crisis.

The Elctoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. This also confused voters sometimes when vote for the wrong candiate. The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elctoral vote. This can make the election get thrown to the house of representatives, which make the state deglations vote of the president. The Electoral College is unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, includin Rhode Island and South Carolina.

In Conclusion, this is in favor of chaniging to election by popular vote for the president of the United Staes. Is to change elcetion by popular vote is beacuse under the elctoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. In the Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.
