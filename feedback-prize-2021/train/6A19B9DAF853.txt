Facs bieng Facial Acting Coding System is an invention that is really helpful to many people i think that it can help people in so many ways. alot of time people can be hiding and emotion and not show it but it could be helpful for something to tell what they are feeling so that they can either help them or feel that same emotion that they are feeling. Sometimes humans can show many emtions and we might not know whet they are for example there ar ethe simple emtions such is happy, excited, sad, anger, but then there are other emmtions where it might be mixed like happy but sad or angry and sad and sometimes emtions we might not even know what they are and that when the Facs comes in to see what emtion someone might be feeling. There can also be a hiddin emtion within someone when someone might seem happy they might show it on the outside but in the inside they are probly feeling another emotion. One way Facs can be very helpful is by knowing wether that person is going thru some stuff for example a person could be thinking about commiting suicide but nobody would know until their facial expression shows that and it might not be a sad facial expression it could be a diffrent one but with the Facs it would be able to tell someone right away what emotion they are feeling. In conclusion i think that this is a very smart thing to to to be able to recognize or scan somones face to reveal their facial expression is a fenominal idea.
