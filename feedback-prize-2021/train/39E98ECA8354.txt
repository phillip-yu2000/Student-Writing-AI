When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to multiple people. Have you ever asked someone for their opinion on what you should do? Seeking multiple opinions can be good because it helps make fast ideas in important situations, other people might make a better idea that you might not had thought of, and they might convince you to do the wiser choice.

To begin with, it helps make fast decisions in important situations. For example, if there is a really big emergency the people involved can make a decision quicker so less people end up injured. If everyone shares ideas, everyone can build off of each others ideas. It can help if you are a fast thinker because you might be able to get someone out of a bad situation. Listen to other peoples stories when asking for advice because you might be able to learn from their personal experiences. Lastly, everyone working together to make ideas can help a lot.

Secondly, you can get ideas you would have never of thought about. People go through different experiences, so ask more than on person. Ask a coupleÂ of people, and then pick what you thought was the best. The more people you ask, The more options you have to pick from. The older people you ask might have gone through the same thing. To leave off with, ask people who are older than you, because more than likely they have gone through the same.

Thirdly, they can help convince you to do the right thing. You might try to do something bad or illegal. You could think something is cool, and want to try it. Other people might wanna make you do something bad. Maybe the cool kids told you something was cool when it really was not. Listen to the people that really love you and they will tell you when they think something is really good or bad.

To end with, seeking multiple opinions can get you out of trouble, get you out of ba situations fast, and can give you advice you might not had thought of.
