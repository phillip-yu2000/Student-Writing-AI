I agree with this way to learn and study. I think that is a good idea for many students that can't coming to the school or have a work.

One of the benefits is that the students can wake up late, because the class is online so, you can take the class in the afternoon, you can stay in your home relax in the bed also if you want eate you can do.

Some guys work in the morning, in the night or all the day.

I have a friend that he work of

8am to 5pm and he always is tired and this can help his, for the future.

He can study in the night and have his class with tranquillity.

Some people think that this a way to lose the time, but I do't think so.

Because I believe that you can be a profesional person if you want.

My friend don,t wanna work in a restauran all the time, he want to be a mechanic and if he take class online his dream can be convert a reality.

In conclusion I believe that if you want something if have a dream, you need to follow your dreams I don't care if is hard NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.

If you have the opportunity you need to take it.
