We should allow the students to bring there cell phones while they are at school, but as the school rules say "the cell phones should be off or on silent during class. The students may take out there phones when they are at lunch or when they have free time. If the students do not follow these rules they will get consequences for having there cell phones on during class or using them during class. And if the students are using there cell phones during class it may distract other students while they are learning. These students are responsible for there cell phones going on in class or even using them during class. If a teacher is seeing any of there students using a phone the teacher will either take the phone away or he or she will tell the student to put it away because it is distracting the other students from learning. And it will mot just distract the other students, but it distracts the student that has the phone. If the student is not paying attention it could bring down there grade and they will not be learning anything what there teacher is showing them. if they get to distracted with the cell phone they can be in danger at school. they will not be able to do any school sports when they have really bad grades. If they were to leave there cell phones alone and start to learn maybe they could start playing sports. they will also bring up there grade as well. These students should start learning and stop using there phones during class. The students may use there phones when they are at lunch or when they have free time. they could also use there phones when they are at home,
