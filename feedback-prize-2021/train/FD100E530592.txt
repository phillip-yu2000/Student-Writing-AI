Well in the Seagoing Cowboys program i think people and plus they get to travel on a boat. Reason why i would join it is because when they get to travel around and they can see things like animals and so that i can play with the animals. If u were a small time boy just like Luke Bomberger you could have a unbelievable trip. The trips were amazing also but the one that standed out to me was the cattle-boat trips. It took two whole week to cross the Atlantic Sea. Luke Bomberger had a job as a watchmen once and it didnt go to well he. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour he was going to cheack on theam when he flew and he broke his ribs. But most importantly of all it opened up the world to Luke Bomberger he said he is grateful for this opportunity. It made him be more aware of people. He hosted a number of international students and exchanged visitors for many of years to tell him about his job.
