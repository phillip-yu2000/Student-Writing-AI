Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe the new phone policy for our school should be policy number one, because to forbid phones from school altogether may cause more harm to our school, then good. Cell phone can be put on silent and wouldn't even make a sound or distraction. punishments could be made if the phone isn't on silent.

First off, i would rather accept consequences then leave my phone at home while i go off to school. I also know that most of my fellow students feel the same way. Even now, when phone are supposed to stay in lockers, students rarely follow that rule. the subject of "no phones," is just unacceptable for kids. If phones were taken from children, then resentment toward teachers and grownups in general might start. kids wouldn't believe that the teachers are in for their best interests. most student wouldn't follow policy number two and them who knows what other school policies will be taken for granted.

Secondly, phones are not only for social uses, but for emergencies as well. If something bad were to happen and a student needed to contact someone, the school wouldn't have all the contacts that might be useful.

Last of all, there is absolutely no harm done if cell phones were allowed during break times. Being a student, i still understand that it's a big distraction when phones ring during class, but if the students phones are off, then there is no problem. if a phone does ring in class, then a lunch detention would suffice.

All in all, its very important for happy students to be involved socially with each other. support is needed for school, and i believe that phones are a great way to bring students together. if teachers took cell phones away from student, the students will not likely respond well. policy number two is defiantly in the students best interest.
