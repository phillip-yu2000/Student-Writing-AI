Venus is the second planet from our sun,he is the closet planet to earth. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth.

Venus has erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequend lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it surface beyond high pressure and heat. but even if the planet is so inhospitable,scientist discussing further visits to its surface because venus still has some features that are analogous to those on eath. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar feature such as valleys,mountains,and craters that allow us to say He can sometimes is are new option for a planetary visit.

If you visit this planet one day,solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth level. The temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degees fahrenheits,the air pressure would be close to a sea level on earth. It not a easy conditions but scientist tink it's would be survivable for humans. Many researcher are working on innovation that will allow our to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowlwdge of venus. So if we know well the working of this planet it would be more easy to visit.

Nasa is working on other approach like simplified elctronics to studying venus like system that use echanical part can be more resistant to pressure,heat and other forces.

Our human curiosity will likely lead us to many endeavors success. Our travel on earth should not be a limited experiance but should be a experiences of disccovery,imagination and innovation of new things and may be one day that will allow us to visit other dangerous planets.
