Dear Principal,

I understand that you are deciding whether or not to make community service a school requirement. This is a big decision for the school and its students and you must look at the perspective of some of the students.

I myself find community service appealing and would enjoy have it as a school requirement, but I believe making it a requirement for all students is not a smart idea. Some of the students have jobs they have to do after school and do not have the time to do community service. An example of one of the jobs that students may have is to watch their siblings after school while their parents are working.

I believe community service should be required by all students. So I think that students who already have too much food on their plate should have to bring in a parent or guardian to say in person that schoolwork, homework, and community work is too much for their child to handle. This way a smart student will not be given a bad grade because they did not fulfill the required community service.

This is what I believe and what I think should be done about required community service. Thank you for taking the time from your day to hear my words and I do hope that they have helped you decide on what to do in relation to community service.

From your student,
