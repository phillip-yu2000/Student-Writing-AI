A Face was just found on Mars. Some believe that it was created by aliens. They don't have proof to show that it was created by aliens. Therefore, the Face is just a natural landform.

There are a great deal of reasons to believe that the Face is just a natural landform. First, what evidence do the people that say it was created by aliens have. To make people believe that te Face was created by aliens, they have to have something to prove it. Then, there are comparisons to landforms on Earth that are very similar to the Face that was found on Mars. They also have no alien markings to prove that aliens made the landform.

There are many reasons to support my claim. Some say that it was too cloudy to see any markings. But the "Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look." The spacecraft was rolled 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. The team had an "extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution." Using a camera that good, people would be able to see anything resembling any alien markings.

Using this evidence, peolple should believe that the Face is just a natural landform. The people who go against this have no proof of the landform being created by aliens. Go with the facts, not unproven theories.
