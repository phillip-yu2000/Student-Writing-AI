Would it be good to have the air you breath be posinous, or not be able to see a sunny day agian? This is what could happen if cars were used as transportation. Elisabeth Rosenthal said that cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. People could make towns smaller to help with limiting car usage. The world is also becoming more conntected with the new delevpoment of techology that cars are starting to feel obsulte.

Cars are very destructive to the enivorment they produce lots of greenhouse gases and create smog. in pairs alone there are about 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London said Robert Duffer. Duffer also said cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. So to help all these casue go down people are trying to create samller communities like in Vauban, Germany.

Vauban, Germany is a test suburb where people have to give up there casr to live in the small community. The people of community like Heidurn Walter mother of two said " When I had a car I was alwyas tense. I'm Much happier this way." This shows that people are happier without there car. This should help the develpoment of smaller communties. They also had another test in the city of Bogota. They tried a car free day. This day help parks and sports centers also have blommed throughout the city. Making a smaller community well help with the interaction with people and with the develpoment of technology it is becoming eaier for people to conncet.

People's love affiar with cars has stared to lower escpially in America. Mr. Sivak has also found the poeple do not really need cars anymore. Technology has helped with the conncetion of people. So having little car usage will help with lower greenhouse gas emmisions. Having smaller communites well also help connect people.    Â
