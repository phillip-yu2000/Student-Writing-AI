a computer can not tell if your happy or if your sad, or if your confused or upset or angery. you can act like your happy and not really be happy people do it all the time they put on a mask. a computer dosnt know what your feeling, no one does but you so its kinda stupid to think that a computer of all things can tell you what your feeling. in the artical it stats how the software works and how your muscles in the face move when you show emotions. you can move the muslces in your face it also talk about how when you smile you become happy so acting happy makes you happy. you cant just become happy by smiling usely theres something that makes you happy so if you sad and smiling makes it better then why are there so many sad and depressing people out there. if smiling makes you so happy why isnt the world just a wonderful place. if this software is so good why dont they use it on criminals to see theyre tell the truth or to really show if they show remorce for what they did. this is why i dont think that useing a computer to tell emotion is very relaible.
