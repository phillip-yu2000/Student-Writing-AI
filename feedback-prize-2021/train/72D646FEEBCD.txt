The author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is the second planet closest to our sun in our solar system. Venus also neighbors with Earth and Mercury. Sometimes we're closer to Mars or other times we are to Venus.

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. that could mean Venus could be our nearest option to go, other than Mars. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.

In conclusion, It's a good idea to study Venus because some day, you never know what happens to our planet and might to go to another planet to survive and form a life there. I would rather choose to go Venus because of all life forms it had long ago and maybe humans could still survive in that planet.
