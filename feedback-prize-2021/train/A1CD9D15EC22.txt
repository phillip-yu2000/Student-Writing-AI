Dear Principal,

I have thought about your decision on whether or not students have to perform community service, and although community service is great, I believe that students should make their own decision. After all it is their time and they should choose what they want to do with it, some kids may want to perform the community service but some may want to be with their friends or simply doing another activity. Also take in mind that some kids are really unable to perform community service because they may have prior commitments and you can't just make them abandon that activity because it may be something that they absolutely have to do. You also may not know that some kids' parents may be working at that time so they must take care of their siblings. Community service is great and all but you have to take in mind that there may be a priority greater to some students than having to volunteer their time towards the community when they have other more important things to do. For some it will be their choice not to get involved helping the community be a better place but for others you cannot just simply require them to have to volunteer their time to not do something that would take away from their time that they may have needed to do something more important to themseves. So I tell you do not make community service a requirement for your school because there may be many people that cannot give their time to this cause.

Thank you for letting me have just a moment of your time and thank you for listening and taking my thoughts to mind. I hope this makes a great impact on your decision and once again, Thanks!

Sincerely,
