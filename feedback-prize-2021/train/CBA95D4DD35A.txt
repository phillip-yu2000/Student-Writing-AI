The face on Mars wasn't created by aliens. The way I know this is that our spacecraft around the planet Mars took pictures and concluded that it was just a martian Mesa or just a natural landform. We unveiled the picture to the public to see what they see it has a illusion of nose,mouth, and some eyes. We had non believers at NASA like myself,so we had sent another spacecraft to see if the face was really was created by aliens or if it was a natural land form. On April 5, 1998, We sent a Mars Global surveyour to the planet and snapped ten pictures sharper than those on the original Viking camera. Revealing that the face was just a natural landform. People were not satisfied and said it was a haze so on April 8th, 2001, A cloudless summer day in Cydonia we drew close enough to the landform for a second look. We captured an extraordinary picture using the maximum resolution. We got a Martian equivelant of a mesa or a butte. Landforms commonly seen in the American west. I said,"It reminds me most of the butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."
