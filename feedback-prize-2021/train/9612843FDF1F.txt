Dear Principle,

for some students say that "what's the point", "why do we have to do this", "this is a waste of my time". Don't let that get to you. For their trying to prove your weak, for that's why you have to make it a requirement in school so later on when they are doing the community service they'll be thanking you later in the year and be realizing they were wasting time on idiotic things that include video games or online chats.

Weather you decide not to think about the future when everyone gives up on community service think about your homes, neighborhood , your family doing the exact thing as the community. For when everyone gives up the Earth would be dying and the water would be scarce, everyone wants to be healthy so please, please don't say no.

When you decide yes, thank you for going with my opinion I will not let you down for i have reasons. First it takes 21 days to make it a habit so then from then on you wouldn't have to worry. Another, the Earth would be healthy, also the water clean and drinkable. Your family would be so glad this was a healthy place to live at and no liter anywhere. Students won't be to drowned into so much video games that they won't function in class because too much video games kill your brain cells. Now that won't be good.

So I would like thank you for taking your time to read this very deeply and highly recommend you to choose for this to be a requirement because happy student equals happy life. Also, when you have further questions I am pleased to answer them. When you want to make a certain goal make it exciting for them.

P.S.

I'd have the pleasure of making a speech for it.

From,

Community Service
