Luke the Seagoing Cowboy

I would love to do that again.

That was fun, thanks so much Don Reist for asking me to go.

I loved to be a Seagoing Cowboy, since I'm a small-town boy.

I want other people to go on an adventure and see things they have never seen before.

I say this because I went on a adventure I got to help animals.

I had lots of fun on the boat.

I did things like table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whitlling, and games.

It was the life of a Seagoing Cowboy I am living, that I have never lived before.

"I'm grateful for the oppertunity to see the things I saw.

It opened up a whole new world for me.

"Besides helping, people I had the side benefit of seeing Europe an China."

I loved to do it I had lots of fun with the people on the ship.

The animals I met where so fascinating.

There were 335 horses plus!

I would definantly go back another time.

I hope you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy as soon as you hear how fun it is.

I have to go now I have to sign up again for a Seagoing Cowboy.

See you later. I'll tell you what fun I had this time.
