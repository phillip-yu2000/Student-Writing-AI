I think that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Think about all the great things that will come out of joining the Seagoing Cowboys, it is more than just an adventure.

One reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because you get to see different places along the way.

During one trip I had the benefit of being able to see Europe and China.

Also being able to see the Acropolis in Greece made it more special.

When you join this program you will see it as a opportunity, for me it was an unbelivable opportunity for a small-town boy like me.

Another reason to join this program is there is also sometimes where you get to have fun on board.

We would mostly have fun on our return trips after we had unloaded the animals. We would play baseball, volleyball and other stuff like fencing, boxing, and reading.

This program is not just taking care of animals you get time to entertain yourself and do somethings you want to do.

The last reason you should join this program is you might not just see it as an adventure but it gives you the opportunity to help others.

This adventure was more than adventure to me it opened my mind to the world around me.

This will make you aware of the people of other countries and their needs, this trip made me.

When you help these people it will make you feel special.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program, It is an amazing experience. Think about you get to see new things, you get time for lot of fun on board, and you the special feeling of helping someone. I hope you will take time to think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.
