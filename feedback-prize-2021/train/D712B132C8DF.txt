I agree that all students must be in one extracurricular activity and my activity is sports. I believe that football can make you work hard like running at someone or,running after the ball and you can play and have fun with friends. A lot of people like watching kid's play football at there school.

Football can make you work hard on running and throwing the ball. The reasons why running is so important is because you run a whole 50 yards and that is very far so they make you run everyday down the field and back three times at the most. They run everyday to help train your body to get in shape.

I think having fun is the most import part to being a football player because you get to hang out with friends on the field while playing football. I think making friends are fun because they can tech you some new stuff like new moves to get around on the field. The best part about making friends is that you get to hang out with them after the game.
