Dear Principle,

I know you are trying to make the tough decision of whether or not students should be required to do a certain amount of community service. I myself believe that everyone should try to do some service that would give back to the community, it doesn't matter how much you do , every little bit counts. If everyone did something small that helps the community, then everyone would be doing their share of the work, and it all would add up to a better community. For example, if someone cleaned up all of the trash in the parking lot, then someone else could try to make sure people use the trash cans. Or if someone went to local food pantry to help hand out food, another person could collect food for that same food pantry. If everyone participates in helping out, then there is no telling how much good can be done. So if you are still deciding on whether or not making students give back to the community is a good idea , then maybe it would be wise to at least ask them to give at least a little of their time back because in the end it all adds up to a better picture.

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
