I think that students should bring phones to school but turn then off and put them in their locker.

If the students don't do that job they might be in a big problem. in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students.

Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids.

If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures.

In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time.

During class time students might listen to their favorite songs on their phone and don't pay attention to the teacher which they will get a worst citizenship in their report card and they will not graduate and they will feel sad and shocked about what they have done to hurt them.

lastly these are the reasons that students allow and not bring their phones to school,
