The process of the election of the president of the United States is somewhat ambigous. The Electoral College basically controls the shifts between the competion, in a way that some rare cases in which a candidate loss the presidential election because of the amount of votes the Electoral college. The Electoral College should be abolished, not only is it unfair but irrational.

The Electoral College basically chooses for the people in some of the pass elections. The process of the voting in The Electoral College consists of five hundred and thirty eight electors, but only the majority of two hundred seventy electoral votes are required to elect the President. The Electoral College has a method to over rule by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes a winner. When the people in general vote for a candidateÂ  they sometimes vote for a slate of numerous democratic or republican electors. We as the people not all the time but it happens, get puzzled when voting. When it comes to applying what you know about your future President some of the voting body doesnt know what candidate to decide on, since some times the candidates have similar campaign goals.

Some states called Swing States contain the people that pay really close attention to the candidates campaigns. The voters that pertain to these states want to really listen to what their prefered candidate has to offer, as well as the the opponents campaign. Now people really need to have an actual choice over who their countrys leader is, for some people they are fine with the Electoral College taking their vote and only think of it as a vote.

In conclusion, I think that we the people need our votes to count as well and even more then the Electoral College just for the reason that we are voting for the person who will lead our country for four terms. In the end the Electoral College needs to be abolished for our vote to count.
