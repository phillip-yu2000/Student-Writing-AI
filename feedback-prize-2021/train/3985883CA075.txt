Every day we make multiple decisions. Some decisions may be easy and not require much thought. Some decisions may require tons of deliberating and cause copious amounts of anxiety. People in these situations often reach out to multiple people for advice. Some choose to talk to friends, family members, or even online forums dedicated to similar issues. Seeking multiple opinions before making a choice is beneficial because people often have different points of view, there are multiple options to choose from, and an individual may feel reassured when others share their opinion.

When seeking the advice of others, it is important to ask many different people. Everyone has their own experiences that shape their opinions and outlook on the world. It is possible that someone may have endured a similar situation and could share their solution. Many people choose to confide in loved ones when facing a challenge. As mentioned previously, there are a number of people willing to help make a strenuous decision. There are even TV shows and radio stations dedicated to solving problems.

When people are stressed they typically cannot think clearly. Sometimes, it feels like there is nothing they can do to escape their situation. Once an individual feels hopeless, they lack the motivation necessary to resolve a conflict. Seeking opinions from others can positively impact someone in a situation like this. Asking for advice will most likely multiply solutions for a problem and provide hope.

Maybe a person could have already resolved a conflict, but is not sure they ended it properly.

Reaching out for advice can make someone confident in their decision. Some people may even tell others about their situation to feel better about themselves. When hearing positive reinforcement, many people feel as if they have made the best decision. This could potentially motivate them to make similar choices in the future, or suggest that others take similar courses of action.

As seen in the previous paragraphs, there are countless reasons as to why someone would want to hear multiple opinions before making a decision. An individual could simply want to hear different opinions, have many options, or feel reassured. Humans are social creatures and greatly value the opinions of their peers. It is no surprise that communicating with others has so many benefits. It is clear that making decisions is much easier when asking multiple individuals because people have different outlooks on life, the possibilities become abundant, and positive reinforcement is gained.
