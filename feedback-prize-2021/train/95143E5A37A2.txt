Are you for or against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expression? No, I do not believe we as a whole should be able to use this. The reason why I believe this should not happen is because everyone is intitled to their own opinion. The fact that a computer is able to distinguish this type of information is very scary.

In the article the author Nick D' Alto talks about Mona Lisa he says "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry" (Alto 1). This quote itslef is nerve racking due to the fact that a computer is able to find this information out. Using this type of technology to read students emotional expressions would be helpful but it would not be professional. Honestly who would want to see what a teenager feeling?

There are many other ways this technology can be used such as prison. so we are able to track prisoners feelings. Overall using this type of technology on a group of inncocent people is unprofessional. This type of technology should be controlled in a proper manner.
