Imagine you were on an anlantic and it was storming and you were sliding down the ship but you did not fall because there was a small meatal strip that saved you from falling. That would be so scary and exciting so that why I think you should participate in the seagoing cowboys because I want you to have have great opportunity like Luke did and I want you to have lot of more expirences.

First think of all the fun you will have. Like playing baseball and volly ball games. Also table tennis, fencing, boxing,reading,and whittling. Alot of the games you will play will pass the time.

Another reason is all the places you will be visting. Like Europe, China,and seeing the Acropolis in Greece. You can take gonda rides and see the citys and streets and water of these places you see.

Last reason is seeing all this animals and feeding and taking care on them. Like seeing elhpants, tigers,and horses. The resposablitile you will learn like taking care of when they sleep, what to feed them, and to clean up after them.

To conclude you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because of the great opportunity and of all the expirences. You will have fun, you will be visting different places around the world, and you will see lot of different animals and you will have to take care of them.
