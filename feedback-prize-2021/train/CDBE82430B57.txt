When you need advice what do you do? Do you talk to someone? If so,is it good to ask someone or even multiple people? I think it is because you can find what is the best option,sometimes its good to express yourself,and if you tell someone they might tell more people and you will have really good options. So I belive its good to ask many people for advice.

My first reason is to find what option is the best. What I mean by this is,if you only talk to one person for advice then sometimes it can go bad because,their advice is not going to be the best choice and sometimes it can make things worse. So if you ask multiple people there is a chance you can find the best choice that can help you.

My second reason is, its good to express yourself. If you express yourself and ask for advice it will put less stress on you and you can focus on something else because its off your mind. It is also good for your mental heath and it can buil up your self confidence. It will make you more comfortable to talk about your issues and ask for more advice.

And now for my last reason;My last reason is if you ask more people for advice it can help you. It can help you because the people you asked for advice might ask or tell their friends and you will have more options. This reason tides in with my first reason because this reason can help you find the best option and thats what I talked about in my first reason.

In conclusion, I think it is good to ask more than one person for advice because you can find what is the best option,sometimes its good to express yourself,and if you tell someone they might tell more people and you might have really good options.
