Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I STUDENT_NAME, strongly disagree in the new policy you are trying to establish to our school, one of the reasons that i disagree in it is that, i think that the part where you have to have a B to be in any kind of sport is a bad idea, they should lower it down to maybe a C because not everyone is as advanced as other people, some learn things slower than others, and maybe not make as better grades either, to many people this is easy, but to others that have a difficult time in learning its pretty hard. Another reason is that, maybe the advanced people aren't very good at sports, and the people whom it takes more time to learn something new are good at sports? the school wouldn't have very good teams with people who aren't good at sports and maybe the advanced people would rather study more than be in any kind of sport. i would be delighted if you took some time into this and had some thoughts, thanks for your time.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
