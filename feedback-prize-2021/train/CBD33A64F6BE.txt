Some people like to argue that the face like form on mars was created by aliens but i disagree. There are many landforms that have been created with face like forms but that does not mean aliens have created them. For example NASA stated that they take photos of mars all the time, year round to use on research if there were aliens then why have they not been seen or found in any of this phots they take.

The text also states that scientist belive its just a natural landform. Also there are many rocks that we find and many landforms that look like faces and different types of objects but we never assum that they were created by aliens. These landforms are called or campered to butte or mesa landforms. Also if there were aliens then how did they make this landform and how did the "alien" even get there or survive on that plante.

If there even were aliens then were are they because if they lived on mars we would definetly be able to see them and see where they were living.

So I belive that the face on mars is just a natural formed landform and those are my reasons why.
