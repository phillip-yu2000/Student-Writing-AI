Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by Word War ll. In this passage there is a lot of good things and bad things about being Seagoing Cowboy, like what fears you have to overcome,what jobs you do, and how long you have to do it and what kind of fun they have.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

To become a Seagoing Cowboy you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When he was going to make his hourly report to his captin he fell on a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowboy. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also he had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took his ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowboys got to have some fun. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

Tabel-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

To sum up my thoughts, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't that bad.

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowboys in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowboys.
