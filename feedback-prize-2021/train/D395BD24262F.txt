Dear Principle,

I think having students that cannot part take in sports, unless they have a

B average is outrageous! Students express themselves in sports, B average or not. If my pupils are wonderful at sports but have a C average, and are not allowed in sports is a waste. All that talent would be thrown away if you keep the policy.

Students all want to do something that they love. It keeps there spirits high and they have a good childhood life. I wouldn't want to have a school that is always under the weather because they cant play sports. Kids need time to burn off all there energy to keep them fit and strong. Just having B average or above kids be able is not going to benefit the school in anyway.

Students need motivation in order for them to keep there school work up. If they cant play sports then there grades will drop even lower. The student will feel depressed and confused, if they cant do something that they love. To take away sports for some kids will make them feel like they have had a part of them torn out of them.

The students will work harder if they are in sports. They would want to keep there grades up in hope for a scholarship. Brain cells need activity in order for them to function right. Sitting down all day is tiring and boring. Having all student be able to play sports would also mean less fights. When you are active you burn off those emotions. Students will have a more tight schedule if they play sports and keep there grades up. This will mean less time for goofing off and having bad actions. I hope you take this information into thought, and will disband the policy.

Thank you,
