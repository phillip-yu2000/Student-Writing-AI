Do you participate in a school activity? Weather or not you do, imagine that your principal made everyone in the school, including you, participate in at least one school activity. I think that would be a great idea because students could meet new people, be more active, and find a new talent or skill they didn't even know about.

Do you know someone who might not have a lot of friends or talk to a lot of people? Your principal making at least one school activity a requirement could help fix that. I think that students meeting new people is very important. Especially in today's age, when most of our communication is done online, and not face to face. If every student did at least one school activity, kids would meet a lot of new people.

Keeping kids healthy has been a issue for years as more kids are staying inside instead of going outside. Most school activities will provide kids with enough activeness needed to stay healthy. Even if the activity isn't outside, getting out of the house is still good.

A lot of students have un-discovered talents and skills. One of the best things a school can do is help kids discover un-noticed talents. Maybe there is someone in your school right now, who will one day be the best football player ever. As their one required school activity that kid picks football, he finds out he is really good at it, and ends up going to the NFL.

A lot of schools focus way too much on education and so little on student's personal lives. If all schools required one activity for students it would improve the quality of life for the student at home, and at school. Meeting new people. being more active, and finding a new passion or talent are all good reasons students should be required to do at least one school activity.
