Dear, Principal

I think you should go with policy number 2 because the phones in school would distract the during class and they would be texting and calling everyone around the school and at lunch they should be more worried about eating the she did that and he is doing that. The ringing will distract other people who are trying to learn or catch up on there work. and grades overall will start to fall to bellow average grades for most students. Also if someone gets a hold of some one else's cell phone they could get the technology to black male the cell phone's owner and that would be considered bullying.

As you can see the cell phone policy being allowed is a bad thing because people who are failing probably already have a cell phone and text message their friends. but if you are going to band them they will have a much higher grade because they are paying attention to the teachers a lot more often then they did before.

That is my reasons why I am going with policy number 2. Up above I showed and explained my reasons why my choice was with number2 and you probably did not get a lot of policy 2 pickers.

Sincerely,
