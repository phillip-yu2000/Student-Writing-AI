Dear Principle,

I have heard recently that you are considering to change the school policy by not letting student with a grade of C average participating in sports or other activities. Only student with a grade of B average and above are allowed to participate in sports and other activities. Many of the students that attend this school have a grade C average. I am against the policy because the students with C' s and bellow would not be able to participate in sports, and I am pretty sure it is required by law that every student is supposed to have 1 hour of physical education.

It would be real unfair for the students with C' s and lower to be denied that privilege. Every student needs to get up and do something active, its good for them. Instead you can help the kids that need it so they can get they grades up. Maybe you can keep them after school and have teachers help them in the areas they need it most. That is what I think you should do, but in the end, you decide what is best for the school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
