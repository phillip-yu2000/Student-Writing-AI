There are many advantages to having a car. such as being able to go drive places with your friends or even driving across the country, but there are also a lot of down sides to a car. such as paying for gas money, paying for ensurens, or even paying for the car its self.

If you happen to live at the beach or in the city there is really no reason for a car. Almost every thing at the beach or in a high populated city is either within walking, biking, or busing distance. This way you save money and you can get a good exercise.

Also polution is very bad in the world today. In france dieseles make up 67 percent of vehicles. which dieseles are known as the most poluting vehicles/gas in the world.

The day without cars campaign that began in bogota in the mid-1990's was a great idea! I think that america should adopt this campaign and put it in to action. This "day without cars" would not only cut down polution and get people out side execising, but could also even save life that could have been taken due to car accedents or people geting hit by drunk drivers while walking.

So those are just some of the reasons why I encourage limiting car usage and promoting alternitive choices for transportation.       Â
