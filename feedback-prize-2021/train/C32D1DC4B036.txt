The driverless cars has been an idea that has been around for many years. The thought of not having to waste energy in driving and to make the experience more relaxing for the individual. It will also display the amount of intellegence and engineering it would take in order to construct such a car. However, there will be many different people who will wish to insult and bring down the idea of the driverless cars. Not only that, but there will people in the world who would wish to turn the positive idea into a negative one. It will also start to corrupt our natural human abilities. What I mean by that is humans will start to become more and more relient on having everything completed for them with minimal effort envolved. Eventually, we will start to become lazier and lazier as advancements in technology increases. One thing to note, I am not entirely against automation or self-seficient machinery. However, how could we say that we are hard working individuals when a robot will be doing the work for us? Could we truely call ourselves hard working when all we would have to do is push a button?

One major example of how this will be a problem in the future is the fact that there won't be any laws inplace of the driverless cars. Numerous states have already opposed the idea and plan to keep it that way until the cars are proven reliable. In paragraph 9, it also discusses who will be counted liable for an accident. "...if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultÂ—the driver or the manufacturer?"(Waiting)

The point that I am trying to make is that we are expanding too rapidly. The ideas are good and can be benificial in the future, but lets take our time and make shure that these driverless cars can actually drive themselves. It is difficult to say when these will be done, but when they are, I hope that it will be avalible for everyone.
