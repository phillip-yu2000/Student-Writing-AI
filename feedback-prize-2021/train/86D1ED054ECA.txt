If Venus is so inhospiable, why are some scientist discussing visits to its surface? "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," is abut the risk and how hard it is for our technology to survive Venus' surface to explore. This is how the author supports his ideas of studying Venus.

Here are some of the authors claims on why it is imortant and worth it to explore Venus. The author thinks that studying venus is a worthy persuit despite all of the dangers that come with exploring the planet. The author says that astronomers are facinated by Venus because it it could have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Also becuas Venus was porbably covered mostly in oceans meaning that life forms could have lived on the planet. The planet also has rocky sedement, valleys, mountains, and craters just like Earth. Venus can also be our nearest option because space travel takes such a long period of time. Because of these reasons the author thins that Venus is worth exploring eventho the risk is so high.

In "The Challenge of Ecploring Venus," the author has supported his ideas. The author said that Venus is most Earth like and could have also suported life long ago. Also that it sometimes the closest option for exploration. I think that we should explore Venus more If our technology advances enough to allow us to explore safely.
