dear, Senator

Electoral college would be better to use to elect a preseident then a popular vote because its just logical. This was the way the founding fathers had made america so we should keep it that way. Also why would you change something that has is'nt broken. To choose a popular voting would be to outragious to even consider changing for the united states.

when the fathers of our country made the united states they made the electoral college for a reason. they wouldn't make it so that we would fail aas a nation. They made this method to make it easier on us in the future but also make it effective. from the beggining of the u. s. we havent had much of problems in electing a presidet because of how effective and easy it is to follow trough with the way we elect now.

If the electoral college hsa been working for this many years then why would we risk losing it over a way that might not even work. Yeah it might sound like a great idea to use a popular vote, but some of the greatest idea fail and if we fail with this idea it would ruin the whole country. There would be crime blowing up everywhere you look, riots, robbery, fights, gang wars, ect.... Never fix anything that isnt broke.

In conclusion dont change the way we elect a president. this way was made by the founding fathers that created the united states and it hasn't failed yet. Also if it's not broken dont fix it. electoral voting is way better then popular voting for many reasons.
