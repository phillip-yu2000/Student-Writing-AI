Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 is the best choice for our school. This policy states that "students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and use them during free time and at lunch as long as they are turned off in the classroom." There are several reasons why I think this is the best choice for our school. Below are a few of them.

Firstly, I think you should choose this policy because being a student here, I know what its like to want to communicate with friends. I think that if you let us use our cell phone at lunch to communicate with friends, we will be less likely to be rude and obnoxious in the class room.

Second, as you may know, some cell phones are equipped with internet, music, cameras and other things that could keep a student busy at lunch time. In example, if a student has a cell phone that plays music, that person will sit quietly listening to music instead of other, disruptive things he might be pressured to do by his "friends".

Third, if a student has a cell phone that they are allowed to bring to school, it may make them more apt to attend school instead of sitting around all day playing on his or her phone.

I know that there are several negative points in allowing students to bring cell phones to school, such as classroom disruption, thefts and damages to mentioned devices, but in my opinion i think the more positive points that i have listed above outweigh the negative ones. So, in conclusion, I think that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school.

Thank you for listening,

Sincerely,

Student.
