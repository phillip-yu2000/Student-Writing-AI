Have you ever wondered how you would get through the day without a car to drive you to school, afterschool clubs, soccer practice and home at the end of the day? In several places around the world citizens are cutting down, or off,with their car usage  and starting to transport themselves by bycicle or walking.  Vauban, Paris and Bogota residents have described this new way of living as stress-reducing and has also been a domino effect for places around the world!

The first point, described by previous car owners in Vauban, Germany is the lack of stress in their life after the conversion to a no-car lifestyle. "When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Citizen Heidrun Walter described the change as positive even while juggling her full-time jobs of being a media trainer and mom.  The loss of time spent in traffic has produced a more relaxed lifestyle in Bogota, Colombia as well.  Carlos Arturo Plaza, citizen, explains that the switch as "A good opportunity to take away stress." As a whole, nobody likes to sit in traffic and walking or riding a bicycle to work makes one less thing you have to worry about.

Having citizens convert into not using automobiles full time also produces the domino effect. For example, because of Bogota using this lifestyle the Colobian cities of Cali and Valledupar have followed in their lead. As well as the obvious that this change brings, is also is shedding off on other places that want to improve their surroundings.  With other cities, countys or even countries joining in, we can slowly make the world a healthier place.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has brought positive effects on the cities of Vauban, Paris and Bogota. These places have shown signs of lower stress and an easier way of life.  Many other places have been adding on to the trend and can make the world a much less polluted and better place to be.
