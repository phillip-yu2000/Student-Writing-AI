Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally believe students should participate in community service whether it is picking up litter or tutoring children that need our help, because that is what our environment needs. Maybe not every student but few that really want to help, because if everyone is helping out, I don't think they will get the whole concept, because of there attitude towards helping out with the community.

Anyways, my point is to all this is, there's so many children that could use our help. For example, say a student named John needs help on math for graphing, the teacher could have explained it in several different ways but still no use, if we let students perform in community service to tutor other students who need our help, than it would help out a lot because John probably would understand graphing better with a person his own age explain it to him.

I also think we should be able to perform in community service because the economy's getting real bad, specially since its like no one cares about respect for our environment. Having students clean up the roads, streets, recycle , etc., would be a huge help for everyone. Specially for our own sake, because this is where we live, now i very doubt anyone would want to live in a dirty town, city or even state.

Yes, this may take time away from doing what we want to do, like going to the movies with friends, or hanging out, but I'm sure we could always do those stuff another day. What's more important? Our community or hanging out with friends? I believe our community's way more important. So we should definitely allow students perform in community service, it would even help them learn about taking care of where we live and how to do things right.
