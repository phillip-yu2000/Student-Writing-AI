A lot of people who drive their cars use their phones and don't know that it can seriously put you in danger. In a bad situation, you can die in a car crash for being on your phone. I am here to tell you why.

Humans don't know that phones can seriously distract you from driving. While engaging in driving on the road, you can put other drivers in danger of you losing control and getting in a crash. You can not only kill yourself, but others on the road. Driving requires your full attention and being serious, not being on your cell phone. I suggest people who drive to make their important call/text before they get on their road.

According to carsuance. net, there are over 40,000 car accidents per year. 33% of those deaths are from being irresponsible, including being on your cell phone. And the majority of those deaths are from humans who are in the age range of 16-20, typically people who aren't experienced drivers.

With the information I just shared, I think it proves it's very damaging to use a cell phone while in your car. So in conclusion, for all drivers out there, please do not use your phone and drive.
