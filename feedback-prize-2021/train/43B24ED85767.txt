Dear Principal,

I think you have a great idea on changing the school policy saying that only students who have a "B" average are aloud to play sports.

I think this because it will motivate student to study and get there grades together, because they now if they get a bad grade that they cant play a sport. Another reason i believe that it is an excellent idea is because. They have earned there privilege to play sports. We come to school to learn and playing a sport is a privilege so that would mean only the people who deserve it will play a sport. Trust me, when they start playing the sport they will feel so good because they know they earned it with all the studying and things that they had to do for school to achieve that "B" average .

This will say to the students who have a "C" average if they want to play a sport that you have to work hard for what you want to do or get. So that will motivate the student with a "C" to also get good grades. So if they can only play a sport if they have a "B" average is good because that mean they will try to get grades all year long they will do all of there homework, class work some students may even start to participate more in class. Therefore I think that only student's with a "B" grade average should be aloud to play sports. This idea would get a lot of people's grades up and will be a positive way to improve the school.

sincerely
