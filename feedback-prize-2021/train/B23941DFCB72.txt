My views on the subject are that driverless cars will some day be helpful when all the technology is ready, driverless cars can be a huge help in the world. What if you were late for work and had some papers or documents to turn in? You wouldnt be able to get the work done unless you had a driverless car. Everyone has their own views on the subject but i personally think they could be useful some day when everyone has one.

Something that can happen is if a driverless car and a car with a driver were to almost crash the driver could go the wrong way and crash because the driveless car went the same way so the technology needs to improve.

another issue is price, not everyone can afford a nice new car. Maybe in a couple decades driveless cars might be cheap. A couple companys already have driverless cars but they're just samples or cars that aren't fully developed.
