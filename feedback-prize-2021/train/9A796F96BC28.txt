Dear Mr. Principal,

It's very important to do community service because the students need to learn how clean up the city. If i was them i would do community service because it fun because you are helping out your environment. There some students that agree with me that they say they help by tutoring elementary school children and they clean up litter. But there some students that disagree with us because community service takes too much time away from what they need. And that people love to throw there trash on the floor that not very nice to the community because you are making the city more worst.

We the student of the school would love to have to have community service everyday to help out the community. but you know how are city is very disgusting that why we need the student have to have community service but you have to ask the students parents if they can do community service everyday until the city is so clean.

i would like my city very clean with the help of my classmates. i know that my classmates
