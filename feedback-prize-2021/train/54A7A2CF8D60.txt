I don't agree with your policy change idea. I'm a student with a grade A average, but I highly disagree with your policy change idea. Most of the kids won't have the opportunity to join an after-school activity because the average grade is a C. Some of these kids only try to get at least a C to join a club and raising the bar is most likely to make those kids stop trying. Kids won't be able to pull off both and we will be left without any sports teams or anything else. Do you want that to happen? Yes, academics are important. But, some kids can't do that well and depend more on after-school activities to get a good career.

Many of my friends here at school say if you raise the bar, they will try to go to a different school. Some would still be able to play out of those kids and some wouldn't. If you raise the bar, you will lose students. Other schools will take them in and win all the different sports and debates while our school can't even PARTICIPATE! That will become detrimental too this school. Parents will send there kids too every where else and take there kids out. The school will eventually be shut down, and you will lose your job.

Please don't raise the average grade requirement, because it will only ruin everything. Letting kids in with C' s is better than not having any kids to let in. Don't change the requirement and everything will work out fine. Kids will participate in after-school activities and you can keep this job. It sounds like a win-win situation to me.
