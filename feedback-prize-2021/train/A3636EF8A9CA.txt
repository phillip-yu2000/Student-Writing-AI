why should students be able to chose if the want to do a extracurricular or not?

I desagree with the principle because no one schould make you do something that you don't want to do for anyreason at all. In my old school we had a lot of extracurricular classes that we could join, like honors chores, french club, sports, sert team witch was a recycling team so we could help to recycle, year book, music, and others. I decided to join three sert team, french club the french club it was about cooking and backing french foods, and honors chores witch you had to pass tryouts to join, I passed and joined, the best part of all this was that no one told me I had to join one without me wanting to join it, so that made me fell happy and better that i could chose to do it or to not do it. This year a new school, new house, new family (step dad and stepbrother) so i didn,t really want to join any after school things, but thought the whole entire summer my step dad said the me and my brother had to join or a sport or whatever after school, me and my brother desagreeded and said that we didn't want to, and my mom taking his side said that we had to join one, since me and my brother didn't chose one he chose one for us tykando because that's what his son does, since we had to do it that made me fell a type of anger because someone was making me do something that I didn't want to do me and my brother ended up quitting.

No one should tell anyone they must do something that they don't want to unless that thing is going to save your life or help someone else. If you want to join any extracurricular go for it but if you don't want to than you don't have to,

I disagree with the principle because you should not have to do something that you don't want to do the principle can't make you do a extracurricular.
