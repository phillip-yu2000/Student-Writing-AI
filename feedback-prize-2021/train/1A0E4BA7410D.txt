Dear principle,

I strongly feel like having community service would be a really a helpful way because our school would be clean, we could help our earth from preventing global warming and it would look like we are clean students. The way it would be clean is if every student would clean up there mess and not just throw there trash on the floor. I personally think that throwing your trash on the floor would be stupid and it wouldn't be a good thing, people are more mature and know not to throw it on the ground you can actually get into deep trouble and would have to pay a fine, so that was my first reason, why we should have community service. My second reason is that we could prevent global warming and our earth can die easily, even though on the streets there is trash i sometimes pick it up, it can also effect the sea creatures because they could get stuck in whatever u don't throw away. My third reason is that it would be much cleaner and people out of school would get the idea that this is a good school for my child or children. so we should keep our schools clean and help the earth to be a better place so want to keep the our earth clean or make it an uglier place for us to live in. And who cares if u would waste time just keep your city clean and your neighborhood also parks. Parks get ruined when they are not clean and it wouldn't be a nice place where kids could play. so i consider you having community service for the students.
