To the principle:

I think that promoting this idea for a grade B average for sports participation is not what one would call fair. You see that not all students are good at everything(especially math) and cannot keep up a B average. Some can do better, I know, others are just not trying hard enough; but for some, this is the best they can do. They care about their grades and want to participate in sports, but their knowledge of the failing class is little. I am not asking that you remove this policy completely, I am just asking that you lower the standards that you wish them to meet a little to have their grade average a C.

Another problem from this policy might occur. The re-enrollment rate might drop. Some students may not wish to come back because this policy will not allow them to participate in the schools sports program. The teams may not do so well because some of their best players might be ineligible to play. I am not speaking for one individual student or for my own selfish wants. I am speaking for the student body as a whole. I trust that you will reconsider your policies. I thank you for hearing me out on this important matter.

Thank you,
