Do you ask many people questions to get your best advice ?

Many people do because its easier to listen to what they have to say abut your situation and here is some reasons why , others need to talk to more people to get the best advice they could because you might not like what one person says but like what the other person says,

some people tell their friends about it so they can talk about it first and get their opinion together and then tell the person needing it so they can get the best out of it.

When you hear more then one opinion you get different views of the problem. So you might likes others advice or you might not , it all depends. You get everyone thoughts and opinions and that gives you time to think about everyone opinion and choose which advice is best for you. Different perspectives help with different problems because , some people might have been through the same thing as you and know how to deal with it or cope with it by giving you the right advice and helping you with whatever your going through.

Some people actually think it helps telling a lot of people, so that your friends can discuss it with you and get the best answer as possible.

Because , they can help you in any way by telling you the best outcome. You also trust them a lot because they are your friends and they most likely want best for you so you can really trust them with their advice. They also will have your back , so its best to get others opinions.

in conclusion , I think people ask others for opinions to get different views to help with whatever problems your going through at the time that you need advice. It helps some people by asking others. Your friends could also be there with you with whatever your going through and give you the best advice. So all around I think its because different problems needs different perspectives.Â
