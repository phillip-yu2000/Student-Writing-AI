Saving The World, One Car At A Time

In country like Germany,Paris, and Colombia, they limit the use of cars due to carbon emission. I think that this is a great idea. Limiting car usage means less pollination, which would benefit us greatly.

"If this patterns persists" says Elisabeth Rosenthal, we could turn this problem around. Take Paris for instance, they issued a ban against driving on specific days. Though "almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Robert Duffer's article, the"congestion was down 60 percent. You can't tell me that is not remarkable.

We could just take a day and walk or ride our bicycle to work/school, andÂ  make a difference, so let's try. I know some people think that driving less is an inconvience and won't stop carbon emission, but I think the opposite is true. There will be "gray clouds" like Andrew Selsky says, but we CAN save the world, even if it just one car at a time.
