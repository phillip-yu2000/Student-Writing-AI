I believe that the students should have to have a B average to be eligible for sports and other activities because they will improve their learning, it will motivate the students to work harder, and the policy encourages a more balanced life style.

Grades are very important because they measure l I

think that students who do not have a B average or higher should be given a chance to improve their grade and seek help with subjects they have trouble with. If they fail to do so then they should not be allowed to participate in sports because the students should be spending most or all of their time studying and improving their learning.

Once the students improve their learning, it will be shown by their improved grade and only then should they be allowed to rejoin their sport or activity.

Also the threat of losing the privilege of participating in the activity or the need to become eligible to be in that activity again should inspire motivation for the children to work harder to earn better grades as well as inspiring their teammates to encourage them which promotes teamwork. This also helps the sports and activity teams themselves because only the kids who are really passionate about the sport will try to improve their grades and those who do not care about their teams will be less likely to stay on or be admitted back into their respective teams.

The requirement of a B average to participate in a sport also encourages a more balanced life style which is very healthy for the students. Having a balanced life style is essential for the students to be successful later in life and we should do as much as we can to encourage it.

The policy to disallow students with a grade average lower than a B is a great idea because it encourages learning, teamwork, working harder, and obtaining a more balanced life expression.
