My position on driverless cars is that car manufacturers need to do more research and develop a more safe and effective driverless car, but the thought of driverless cars is pretty cool.

Humanity has always strived to improve thier inventions. When we invented the telephone people soon wanted it to be wireless. Now look where we are; we have phones that can fit in the palm of our hand with more computing power than a 1970s space shuttle. the advancement of technology in the past 150 years is almost unbelievable. from the invention of the internal cumbustion engine to the supercars today we still come up with better and more efficient ways to transport ouselves around. back in the day people would laugh at the idea that cars could move over 140 miles per hour. now it is common to see a car going over 180 miles per hour. But now we are in a time were large automaking companies are developing vehicles where you do not have to drive. the computing power and sensors will be expensive now, but in 20 years they will be mass prodiced and will be on most of the cars on the road.

As you can see, there are many reasons to have autonomous cars and reasonss not to. but my opinion thinks that autonomous cars are the future and can hopefully one day eliminate car crashes on the roads
