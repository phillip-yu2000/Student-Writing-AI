Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an honor and would be a great opportunity for you. A Seagoing Cowboy is a wonderful job to have. You get to go over seas and help out and take care of animals.

I was a small town boy and thought I would never be able to go and see sites like the Panama Canal or take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. But since I became a Seagoing Cowboy I not only got to do my wonderful job ,but also get to see beautiful world natral wonders while doing it.

While being a Seagoing Cowboy I learned what the job was. It was about helping others. A Seagoing Cowboy is the best job in the world for me because of all the opportunities to help people and not only did I get to help peopleI belive I made a difference in their life.

I also had fun while on the sea. I got to bond with people and begin new friendships. We mostly had fun on theway back since all the animals were picked up andwe didn't have to water, feed, and watch them. We liked to play fun games like volleyball and baseball games in the empty rooms were the animals used to stay. It's also fun to have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and games for fun too.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy is more then an adventure it helps you come aware of the people who truly need help. Being a Seagoing Cowboy also opens your eyes as well as heart to the other people around you.
