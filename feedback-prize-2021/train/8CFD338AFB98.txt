Dear principal you have made a new school policy that it is about any students that don't have a grade that its an B on each class they would not be able to participate on sports we the students have the right to play a sport with the grades of A,B,C

it is not fair for students that they just have a C average .And you don't let them play as i read the school district policy say that we all have the right to play on the sports but you are just not allowing that ,Please let us play on sports we all have the right to play that on the bill of right says that its rule number 1 teacher told us on social studies. We the students would promise you that we would behave this school year.

It is not fair for all of us and you don't have the right of canceling this if you don't change them we would go to the SCHOOL_NAME to tell them what's happening on this school

.

If the problem is about that we are falling the class you could just told us about it and we would try to change are grade but you don't have the right to cancel the sport only if we aren't doing thing bad on it or hitting each other but we are not doing that

.

Thanks for reading my letter principal.
