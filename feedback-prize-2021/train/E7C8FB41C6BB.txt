First, while I was on the boat with the Seagoing Cowboys, we had many things to do. One of them was that when the animals were off the ship we played baseball. The ship was big enough for it which was great for us. When the animals were on we learned new things about the animals. The male horses were the hardest to feed. They always kicked, but the females were nice and gentle while I feed them.

Next, when we went to China I saw so many cool buildings. Even some that have not even been seen no where else. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. That was a great thing to see. In Venice, Italy I took no a gondola ride though the city with streets of water. I never saw anything so beautiful in my life.

Then, what I learned on this trip was that helping others that lost something in a war is pretty fun. I got to learn new lauguage and what they ate before everything was taken from them. Doing this will help u see how hard it can be when a we come and you never know that one of the days you live you will feel how they felt when they lost food and a home and even loved ones. Doing this your becoming a better person and people will look up to you for that.

Last, with the honor to do this wonderful thing I became a honorable person. Even though something like this can change things and the way people look at me. I was just a average boy until I went to the Seagoing Cowboys which changed how I even looked at people and myself. Doing this program will change your life and teach people how to be a great person.
