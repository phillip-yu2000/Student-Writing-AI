Dear Senator,

We should change to the election of popular vote. I believe we should do this because, it'd be more fair to the person who got the most votes. If one canidate gets the most votes, but doesn't become president, is extremely confusing, and down right unfair. If you're having the whole United States vote for who we want to be president, but have the electors choose who's president is pointless, it just shows that you don't care what our opinion is for our leader. If the voters have to waste their time to vote for someone who probably be elected is, like I said before, pointless.

Let's say you were running for president, and you got the most votes, but the electors, their almighty wisdom, voted for someone who got the least amount of votes, would you think it's fair for that person to become president? I don't think so. I think you would be able to be president because the people who voted for you would rather have you as president than the others who ran against you. You would've been the best choice to those who voted for you.

Therefore I think we should change to the most popular votes for electing the president. I appreciate you taking the time to read this letter. have a wonderful day.
