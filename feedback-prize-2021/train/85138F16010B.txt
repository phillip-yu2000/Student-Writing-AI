Driverless cars are not a good idea. It's almost defeats the purpose of life. If we had driverless cars then no one would have to go out of there house for anything, and this is a problem because we would never have to leave the house for anything. It sounds like a good idea don't it? Sadly it is not, if we never had to leave the house then we would become lazy and dependent on robots to do everything for us. Outside activity would decrease greatly and the streets would be empty. Well, exept for the cars, which no one would be driving. I don't want to see our people turn to a boring way of life. If we did have these "diverless cars" what do you think would happen to all the fast food industry? I know, since there would be no people there would be no workers at places like; Mcdonalds, Taco Bell, Arbys. Everything would be automated just like the cars. The fast food industry isn't the only job that would be taken by robots, most jobs in america and around the world would be taken. The citizens of the world would have no where to work. That is why these cars are a bad idea.
