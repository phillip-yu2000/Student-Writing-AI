Dear principal,

I am writing this letter to you regarding your idea of changing the school sports policy, I agree and disagree with what you are trying to do. Have you looked at the Pro's and Con's?

Did you consider that maybe the average C students have been having problems at home and sports is the only fun thing that they can really do? I'd like to know what you would do with this policy if every student willing to participate in school sports was a C or even possibly D student, would you leave it alone or change it?

It would be very unfair if you were to go through with your idea there are for sure students who are trying to be successful in school but do not fully understand the material that we are being taught. You're probably thinking well if sports were so important to them then they should make a better attempt with trying to understand the material being taught like going to tutorials. Well if you looked at the records you should see that there is a greater amount of students showing up.

My other point of view on your idea is that perhaps if they do care for sports so much this would be a bit of a drive for them and they would want to be on the sports team so it would be a win-win situation for both of you. You would win because you'd get to change it for what ever reason you'd like to change it; the student would win because they would be able to join the sports team and get they're grades higher as well. Of course there is no way of telling what the out come will be.

Sincerely,
