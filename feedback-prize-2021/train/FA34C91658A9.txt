At some time in most people's lives they have to make a tough decision. When faced with choices a person may look for the advice of others.

They may do this to get different points of view, to hear more experienced people, or just to talk to somebody about it.

By asking other people, they can see other things that they may not have realized. Things that could affect other people in their lives. Others can also make you see the pros and cons of the decision.

There might even be some people who have gone through similar situations.

These people can tell them about their story and how it went, or how to go about whatever the problem is. A few people may even specialize in the field relating to the choice.

For example if it relates to money you can talk to a financial adviser.

Even if their friends know nothing about the problem, people can just talk to them.

To bounce ideas off each other on what to do.

Or even to find a way to join of a bunch of thoughts together. The different ideas may lead to a great outcome from the decision that the initial person didn't even consider.

People come to others when they need advice to get different points of view, find an expert opinion, or just to talk it out. Advice from different individuals can help make a good decision.

People don't have to make decisions on their own most of the time.
