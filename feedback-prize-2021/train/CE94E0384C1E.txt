When you are overthing or having a talk with yourself cause you don't know what to do. Anyone else, and me cause I do it all the time. I always ask people am I doing the right thing be honest and if I feel like i didn't get the right answear I go to the next person and so on cause I want to make sure I do everthing right before it goes on and effects my life , or family. Cause you want to sussced in life not fail everyone deseves chances and some people dont but dont be the one that doesnt keep reaching and soon blessings will come your way cause not everyone is a failer everyone is speacial in there own kind of way even if your not as smart or not pretty or mean rude you are speacial dont let no one tell you different . Anyways it would be good for people to have mutiples opinons to go through and to search for because not everyone is gonna give you the right advivce some people are gonna give you the wrong but you have to work through it to try to make it work cause you are gonna need peoples opinones sooner or later but from the right people not the wrong cause some people are set up for failer and you dont wanna be that peron you want to be bright and succed in life like most people AND GROW up to be something in life so the path i would take if i were you is to succed and grow and work hard for my goals.

One reson why I go to people for there opinons is cause everyone is different stuff happen for resons. Me personally I like to view from other peoples perspective because you dont wanna make a mistake in your life your gonna regreat cause if theres one thing I learned you dont always have second chances people are gonna push you to do bad things thats why you make sure you have people that care about you people that are whiling to be there for you push you in the right direction to do better be better and eventully your gonna appreaite those poeple and the people that gave you such good advice and there opinions will mater at that point.

Also, there can always be that one person im not saying to keep your circle small what im saying is everyone is not always gonna give you the right directions people can be really mean or rude to a point where there gonna give you the wrong responce your not gonna wanna hear cause there are people that are jelouse of you or that are mad that you will make it somewhere in life and that they wont cause they decided to contuine to do the wrong things evenully thats not gonna help you its gonna make you do bad in life and not be able to do the things you wanted to do but its to a ponit you cant control what you are people do anymore if you wanna drop out of school then thats your choice cause reamber you are always gonna regreat later in life what you did cause you dont wanna be they non smart kid or woman you wanna be the perosn everyone talks good about cause people are gonna want you more and there gonna look at you and be like hey she finished school now shes working on her career and that is good that is somothing you want your family or person to talk good about you things.

Let me tell you this your actions speeck better than your words you always wanna be a bright student or kid you don't always want soemthing bad happing to you be smart and watch what you do cause soemtimes that can hit you and you be like where did that come from cause its better to have opinons from your clostest friends not just one friend that you can gossip about or talk bad about if you wanna enjoy what you do I hope you appraite it cause there is love and people that care so much and you dont wanna push it away you want to STAND STRONG AND BE STRONG and be motvational and determinded to do whats best for not just you the people you care about the people you hang around and the peopel you support .

Thats why I think its best to get peoples advice from more than one peopson so you can be able to seek peoples attention and choce what opinions can help more to make better choices . To work hard and apperiate the people that are there for you and that want to be there cause im telling you its hard to find people like that but you have to look cause all those wishes and blessings will come your way eventully i promise not everyone is gonna fail in life they will succed like most people in life and im sure and you that you want to be one of those people and reach high for your goals and do well hard work pays off thats what my parents always told me everything i push you to do today will pay off and you will thank me later on in life so yes push hard work have and do what is right for everyone and you will see the results later and be pround that you listened to the people that was there and the ones that wanted to be there and support you through your desions and push you to be a hard working person cause will appreate that soon I promise just stay bright and think before you do thats the key and challenge your self that you are here and can do and most desions that some people cant have cause of the desions they wanted to make in life to be great but they got around the wrong crew and desided to take advice from some people that didnt want it and never listend but still did wrong but anyways do what is right and listen to the opions people give you and try to sove your problems and always choose the right people to take advice from cause it will pay off and come out right but thats why in my OPIONE it is good to listen and take good advice from people that need it and you choose which one is right and to listen to and it will take you far in life I promise stay bright and thoughtful of what you do and go around cause not everyone is gonna push you in the right path but you have to choose to go and follow that right path or you wont get anywhere but you want to do good and have people amaze you for the things you did ,the work you have done but theres that and my resons why you should take opiones from the people that care for you.
