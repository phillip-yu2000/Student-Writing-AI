Dear senator:

My name is PROPER_NAME im from a lil town called LOCATION_NAME.And I saw where you was trying to see if yall should keep the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Well I think you should change it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

So I think you should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.Because if you elect a president by slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Thats not fare to the other person that was running, because what if the other person was winning and they lose because the slate of electors elect the person that was losing. For example Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

So Mr. Senator can you take what i told you and try and change Electoral College or change to election by popular vot e for the president of the United States. Because it's not fare to the other runner up.

Sinserly PROPER_NAME
