Dear principle,

I would rather prefer policy one, which is that cell phones can be allowed in school and you can use them in lunch time or other free times as long as you do not use them in class. Students think that they can just be cool and use their cell phones in class and hide them behind their books that they are reading. News flash for you kids out there that do that , you can get in a lot of trouble for doing that. The reason that they do not allow us to use cell phones during class is because you could text some one during a test that has already took that test and ask for the answers or if you are doing a review for a class.

By doing that you could get phones took away from school permanently. All because you didn't want to study, so you thought you could text someone and get the answers. If to many people did that then we could get them took away permanently from school and never be able to take them on campus. I do love to text and I am sure that most kids my age do. It is not abnormal to want to text all the time.

However whatever you want to send to someone on the phone can wait until after school. Or if you need to tell your parents something or ask them something,

do not text them and ask or tell in the middle of class, just go to the office and ask if you can use their phone. I think that we should be able to bring our phones to school,

but if we keep texting during class I could completely understand why we couldn't take them to school. Please principle do not take our phones out of school!
