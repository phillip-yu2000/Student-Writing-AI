Dear Principal,

Students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school and be able to use them during breaks and lunch. It might make people feel safer to have their cell phones with them at all times. We could call our parents for any necessary reasons. There might be cons to this policy but there would be with the other one as well.

People might try texting in class if they are allowed to have their cell phones, but if they are caught they should be punished. They should have their phones taken away for certain amounts of time. Students might also be distracted during times when they are supposed to be studying if they have phones, but this should not happen if consequences are being reinforced.

There are good reasons to having phones at school as well.

They should be able to bring cell phones to school, because if we need to communicate with our parents during lunch we shouldn't have to go all the way to the office for some little question. We might have a question that we don't want to be shared with the whole office and everybody in it. If students didn't have a phone with them and they need to ask their parents something after school what are they supposed to do? Go to the office? Sometimes we cannot go to the office because there is nobody there. If children use the cells phones at lunch and breaks it will not hurt anyone they are not doing anything to interrupt class. It might make a person feel safer if they have their phone with them at school. If something were to happen and they couldn't get to the office or to someone with a phone they could use their own.

Sincerely,

Student
