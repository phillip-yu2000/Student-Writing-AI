Dear Principal,

To whom it may concern, some of the kids in our school think that community service is a waste of time and think it takes time away for them to do things they want to do.

I think students should require to perform community service because it would be a great learner quality and it makes the community a better place to live.

If nobody did community service then the town would have trash and all kinds of junk around it.

I think that community service would be great for example , cleaning up a grave yard would be nice for the families relatives that died.

Maybe if you just picked up trash or put new flags in for the veterans who have died in the past year.

When people do community service it makes a big difference to people and the society. Also, if only a little group performed this task then there would not be a lot accomplished and everyone wouldn't `t appreciate as much as the people who did it.

I think you should require all kids to do community service because it would be a great thing to learn about and appreciate for most of your life.

Hopefully you understand what I am trying to say.

Also, it will look good on college applications if they hear that you like to take your time in helping your community.

Anything can be community service even if its just helping shovel an older persons driveway or cutting your own front lawn.

It doesn't have to be cleaning up trash.

Also, I think that you should make a club or something so that more people will be more interested in doing community service.

Thank you for your time!!!!!
