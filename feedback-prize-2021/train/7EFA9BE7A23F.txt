I am against changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average because without sports or activities people are not going to stay healthy. I think it would be better if people could get at least a grade C average. A grade C average is still a good grade and its a passing grade. It only takes a C to continue on to high school or middle school. it is good to get a C or higher grade because it can give you knowledge and it also can get you into a good college.

If people get a C- or below they shouldn't be able to play sports or any other activities because school is more important then sports or activities. Also you have to be responsible to be in sports because you can not miss practice or be late to a game. And with education you have to be responsible as well because you have to do homework and turn in homework without being past the due date. If you are getting a C- or below that means you are lazy or irresponsible therefore you will be lazy or irresponsible in sports or any activities and because of bad grades in school i think they shouldn't let you play sports due to failing classes.

I do not agree with you in changing the school policy. People should at least get a C average in order to play sports. Even though school is more important you have to play sports or do activities in order to get in shape or stay in shape and you have to stay healthy. Sports is one way of staying fit and healthy. It is also good to be active and in order to be active you have to be in sports or do different activities. Also it is good to maintain a C average or higher because good grades can get you into a good college and you can become a pro sport player.
