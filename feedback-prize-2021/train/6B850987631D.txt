If schools offers students distance learning as an option, that student should take the offer. That's my opinion if a school ever offer me online school. If I would have chosen this offer, I would have 3 reason why I agree that offer. Student should always think first if a school offers you something.

My first reason is, student can take their time in the morning to wake up and take a shower. For example, if a student wakes up late to school, that student wouldn't have time to do stuff he/she planned in the morning. But online school, that student can wake up late and take their time what he/she planned in the morning. My second reason is that its less cheaper. In online school, students only need: a computer, notebook, and something to write with. Students also receiveÂ free food from their home. But in regular school, some student pay money to get food, and the supplies for each class can be expensive. My last reason is student sometime finish their online school early, and have the rest of the day to play games, or hang out with friends.

In conclusion, student should always pick the right decision, when it comes to a offer in school. I think online school is good for students. Why, because if a student that is having family problems, and missing school every day. They can take online school, so they don't fail a grade, or miss any important assignment.
