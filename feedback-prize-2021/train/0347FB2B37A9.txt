The electoral colledge is very important. We used it for a long time and still are. The way is smart and is fair. The electoral colledge is very importnant. We should keep the electoral colledge. The states electoral votes are given by population. But its also not fair. Because if you win seven states and then the other candidate wins californa you may not have 55 elctoral votes, but you have 7 states. They should change it to 8 being the minimum electoral votes per state. If you win the three big states you already have 122 electoral votes not including the ones you may win. Some things should change about the electoral colledge. But more things should stay the same. After all that the voting would be a new thing.

The popular vote makes no sense the electoral colledge is the way to go. The electoral colledge is succesful and has worked greatly. Alot of citizens despite it but it works. Weve almost perfected the goverment system. We all agree to soemthing in it. The only problem we have is citizens not getting the president they want. We do not have a dictatorship and we all vote based on are mindest we have laws that we disagree to. The electoral colledge is the thing to do. It would be a bad choice to change it.
