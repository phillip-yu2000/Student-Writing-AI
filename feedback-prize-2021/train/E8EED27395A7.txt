I believe Driverless Cars will have a huge affect on everyone, in a very good way especially. The technology,working,planning, and time is amazing. These brilliant inventor's make and think of so much amazing thing's for the world itself. For example, the Driverless Car is a fantastic invention. By creating and making this vehicle will amuse and and get lot's of people's attention. I myself think it's a wonderful invention, because instead of you driving place's, the Driverless Car can do it all for you, making it easier on the driver. It would be fun and also something new to this world, and when something is new, everyone want's it.

The Driverless Car wont be just a vehicle made to drive itself, but to keep people safe at all time's no matter what. Safety, is the number one priority with car's and many other thing's. There are laws that you have to have a driver in control of the car in some state's. Wouldn't you want that to change, for the better of people and yourself. This wonderful invention will have sensor's and alert's if anything bad happen's, so the car will immediatley stop.

Originally, many futurist's believed that the key to self driving car's was someday not going to be smarter then the car's on the road. Engineer's thought that couldn't be possible, or any other human being. Sooner or later they knew it could be possible, manufacturer's turned to smarter car's. In conclusion i think this invention is by and will be the best thing for everyone is the world.
