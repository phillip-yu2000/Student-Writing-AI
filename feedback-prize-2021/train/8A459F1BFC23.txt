Dear, principal

I believe that students should perform community service. Students like me have it to easy. Now don't get me wrong students do work hard, However not hard enough. Lets take my friend for example he does no work at home or at school, Yet he still has a playstation three. He lives in Atlantic City New Jersey. He tells me that there is plastic and all sorts of litter on the ground and there is no one there to pick it up. Right here in Central Islip there is litter on the ground and I see no one pick it up. I am upset to see this. I want people to come in Central Islip and say what a clean city with educated kids. Not what a dirty city with stupid kids. In conclusion, I believe that if you make community service mandatory Central Islip will be the cleanest city in at least five years.
