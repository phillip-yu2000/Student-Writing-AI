Dear Principal,

The policy you are implementing is not the most efficient because most athletic children are not B average students so if you do change the schools policy you might not have any children participating. As a child myself i can see that there is a difficulty trying to be B average student if you must implement this policy lower the average to a C or B- to show that your not trying to make this so very difficult. As a student i can see the difficulties to maintain a B average or even a C. Don't make this a complete conundrum for my fellow students. My only request is to make the goal of maintaining a good average a little easier to achieve.

I also understand why you are changing the school policy, to ensure that if you want to participate in school funded activities you must maintain a reasonable grade level. The only problem is that not al students are capable or even that motivated to become a B average student and you, by making only allowing B average kids participate will only make things more difficult,

more unreachable and less foreseeable by my fellow classmates.

If you can lower the score level you will see more students participating in class, doing better with home work and better in school work because you made the students more confident in school which will make them want to succeed more.
