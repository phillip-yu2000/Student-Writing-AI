I disagree with this statement, ''your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.'' Same students don't have Enif time to do an after school activity, students's parents might not be able to pick them up, I think students should not be forest to do a after school activity.

My first reason is, students don't have Enif time to do an after school activity. Students have homework to do after school. Students might be spending time with his/her family. Students might be doing comity serves.

My second reason is, students's parents might not be able to pick them up. Their parents might not be at home. They might be working. They might be at a dentist or doctors adornment. They might be out of town.

My third reason is, students should not be forest to do a after school activity. Students hate being forest to do something. Students wont like the activity. They should be aloud to do what they want, and not be forest to do it. Students will do it if they want to.

In conclusion, I think students should not be forest to do an after school activity if they don't wont to. Students don't have Enif time in the day. Students's parents can't get them. Students should not be forested to do after school activity.
