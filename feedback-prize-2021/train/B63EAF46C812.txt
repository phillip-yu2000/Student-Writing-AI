Attending class from home would benefit students by keeping them away from sicknesses, bad weather, and saving money. Online or video conferencing would be offered to students to still get the education they need. With this education from home students will still get the same information as the other students.

Having class at home helps other students to not catch stomach bugs, colds, and viruses.

A school is where many germs are stored. Some parents send their children to school sick because they don't like their child to be absent. After the student attends school the sickness spreads through the school. Students should have the option to take classes at home especially during the winter to prevent getting sick.

Another reason to have class at home would keep students out of bad weather. If it snows some students live in the woods and the road conditions are different than the students who live in a town. Other students live near rivers, lakes, and ponds and a bad rain storm could keep them locked inside their homes. If they could take classes from home, it would keep student drivers off of the road. Then students can be kept safe.

One more reason would be that fuel gets expensive. School buses need fuel to run their routes, so that students can learn. Students getting their education at home saves money for the school. The money could be spent to pay the teachers for video conferencing and other online learning programs. Students would also benefit by less money going into their car to go to school.

Students attending class from home can still get the same education as the other students.

Students can get well, stay safe, and save gas on their adventure of online learning. Online classes and video conferences will come in handy to students.
