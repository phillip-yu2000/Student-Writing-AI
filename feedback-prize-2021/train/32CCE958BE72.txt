We believe that Luke Bomber had an good time, even though it dosen't say that. Luke had an good time because he had got to see and visit animals and 44 nations. Luke had got take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped over seas. He had also got to work with his friend,Don.

Luke Bomder had got to visit 44 nations. Those 44 nations had at the time formed the UNRRA, or known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. He also got to visit Europe, New Orleans, and Greece. UNRRA had wanted to hire "Seagoing Cowboys."

Luke had got to see 335 horses plus he had got to help feed the horses, Luke had got to feed the horses their hay and oats. Luke had got this job after he was working two part-time jobs. He knew that this opportunity of a life time.

To sum up my thoughts we believe that sailing on ships to help out arround the country is a once in a life time opportunity that no matter whoever was offered this opportunity they should take it. This could show you many unique things, many unique places, and most important of all the new people, friends, and unique exeriences and adventures you will travel.
