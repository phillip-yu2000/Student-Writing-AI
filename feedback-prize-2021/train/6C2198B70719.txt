Technology may be a problem for other occasions, but if technology is used for good especially for students education it can be really helpful. In my opinion the Facial Action Coding System can he really useful in schools. If students don't understand the question or directions the computer can make the question easier for them to understand and if the teacher is busy the computer can help them instead on waiting on the teacher.

First, the system can make the recognize the student facial expression and help them understand the question better. In the passage the author includes "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor." As included in the passage "modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor" the system would be helping the student like if it was a real teacher.

Last, you wouldn't be waitng around with your hand in the air wating for the teacher to come help you the system will just help you out. Instead on the time waiting on the teacher you will have been doing your work all the time. The system may explain it better,you never know.

In my opinion i still agree that schools should have the access to use the Facial Action Coding System for students who have trouble understanding.
