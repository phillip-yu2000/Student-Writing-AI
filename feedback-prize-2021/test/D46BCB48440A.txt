When people ask for advice,they sometimes talk to more than one person. Advice is an opinion,that's told to another person. I think advises help people make better choices. Some reasons I think why advises helps is keeps you safe, makes goal come true, and makes changes.

The reason I think advises help is keeps you safe. There are many dangerous people and thing in the world. That could hurt you in so many ways. When I got invited to a sixteen and up birthday party. I was so ready to go but i didnt know if i should go to the party. So i asked my mom for advice. Then she told me it wouldn't be the best idea,I could get kidnapped. I agreed with her and didn't go. That advice from my mom saved me from getting kidnapped.

Another reason I think Advises help is make goals come true. Getting to your goal is pretty hard. But if you have someone to push you through it you can do it. When I gave up on becoming an Artist. My friend told me some advice telling I need to keep going until i reached my goal. And said she cheering for me. I felt hopeful again and happy that she there for me.

The last reason I think advises help is makes changes. Words are powerful and so are action. They can make things happen with multiple of them. At our school,the lunches are very unhealthy. We tell our teacher but they didn't listen. So we interview people around the school and asked them to sign a paper. Once we were done. We when over to the school board. And told them about the unhealthy lunches at schools. They agreed that schools should change their lunches to healthier lunches. And changed the lunches served a schools.

Advises can be helpful or not helpful. But if it can help you then please listen to it. Don't block it out .So many people think it's useless. But it help in so many like keep you safe,make goals come true or makes changes. You can't do everything on your. Sometime it's better to ask for help.
