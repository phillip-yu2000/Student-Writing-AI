Emotions may be hard to understand sometimes, but they are still vital in everyday life so that we as humans can communicate how we are feeling with each other. It is especially vital for teachers to know how their students are enjoying the lesson. With modern technology that can read emotions, teachers may be able to better understand their students, and create a lesson that is fun for everyone.

From an emotion test taken on the Mona Lisa, Professors Thomas Huang, and Nicu Sebe detected the lady's exact emotions based on what is portrayed in the painting. According to the technology, she is "83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfuk, and 2 percent angry." This technology used on a classic Renaissance painting could be used in schools to help teachers better understand the students, and therefore help to make the class fun for every one. In the article it gives the example of a class room computer recognizing when a student is bored or confused, then modify the lesson to fit that person's personality.

All in all, this sort of technology that can read emotions would be helpful for schools because it could help students understand their school work better, and in turn help them do better in school.
