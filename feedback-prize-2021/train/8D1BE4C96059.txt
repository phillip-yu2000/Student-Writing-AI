A lot of schools in America require students to do summer projects to make sure they are exercising their knowledge during the 3 month break, some schools believe they should let the students choose the projectÂ they are going to complete, some schools believe they should let the teachers decide what the students will do.

I believe the students should decide what the project will be, because the summer should be a time where students are taking their break off from school, so the teachers might give the students a really hard and long project that takes a lot of effort to do not knowing how it feels like, so i believe the school should get ideas for what project they will be giving out to the students from the students, choose their favorites from that list so the students dont pick something that is too easy and gives them barely any knowledge out of it, and then let the students vote for what they want to do.

An example of this is at a school in Dubai, where they placed a closed box in every class and let everybody get a peice of paper, write their idea down, fold it and then put the folded peice of paper inside the box,than they open all of these boxes and pick 50 different prompts, then they make a survey and make every student vote for what they want to do out of these 50 different prompts, the one with the most votes gets chosen.

In conclusion, every school should let the students control some of the decisions made, it gives them more freedom and makes them feel like they have a say on whats going on in their lives instead of letting other people decide for them.
