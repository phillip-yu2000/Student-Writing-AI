'' Do you think that it would be fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy?'', Parker questioned

'' I think that it would be a great idea. ,I stated We could go on the ships to see different countries on our free time and we could have fun watching the animals.''

Many resonsons why I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program are you can help out people and you can visit cool places while you are traveling. Also you could get a chance to learn how it feels to help someone out that really needs it like Luke did.

Luke also got the opportunities to see China and Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, and he toured a excavated castle in Crete and he saw the Panama Canal on his way to China, like you could if you did something like this.

Also if you did this you would have the opportunity to see and travel the different oceans like Luke did in his travels.

My conclusion is if you join the Seagoing Cowboy program you will enjoy the sights you see and the wonderful feeling of helping out people ineed in other countries.

I think this because in the article it says ''Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' he says ''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.'' And that

Awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange vistiors for many years. That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program.
