I do not think we should have phones in school. Everyone will be using them during classes.

No one will listen to the teachers about putting there phones away. All the students will try to use there phones in any moment they can. We will have low test grades because everyone will be on there phones during testing. Friends will be calling friends in different time. If one student has free time and the other doesn't ,the student that has free time will call the student that doesn't. Phones will be ringing all over the school. All the students will be late to class because they will be talking to there friends on the phone. All the students will try to skip class ,so they can talk to there friends. All the students that want to get to class will be stop by all the students with phones in the hall way.
