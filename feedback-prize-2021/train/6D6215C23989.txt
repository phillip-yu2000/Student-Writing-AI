Im against to what they are using to see kids if they are mad or sad about anything. That is not good to see what are kids emotional expressions the kids don't want any one to know why they are sad or mad about. Thats why Mona Lisa keeps a smile on her face because she doesn't want anyone to know she mad or sad about something that she doesn't want to tell anyone about what is happing. What if you are having a bad day at school or work or at home and you dont want anyone to know waht is happing so you keep a smile on your'e face. Its a computer software that can recognize emotions."The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". Imagine seeing your'e friend with a happy face but deep in side they are sad or mad about something that happend that day. Its valuable but at the same time no one wants anyone to know if they are having a bad day. What if someone used it on you too see if you were sad or mad or anything like that. You do not want anyone to know that you are having a bad day or anything that is happing in that day that you want no one to know.
