Dear Principal,

I think that the possible policy change is a terrible idea. One reason is because a C grade is considered average. If you are in the average of your class you are doing substantially well. You should be able to participate in sports.

Another reason why I think that changing the policy is a bad idea is because not all the athletes aren't averaging A' s or B' s and as long as their not getting F' s they should be able to participate in sports. Sports are important in most peoples lives and the keep them in shape and healthy. You are hurting people's heath because they have a C average? That's just not right.

Also participating is sports are keeping kids from doing other things that they are supposed to be doing like drugs or getting in to other because. By you doing this you are taking an away their exercise time and replacing it with time to do bad things that can get you in a lot of trouble.

Another reason is that you will hurt the schools athletic reputation. If you limit your students to such a criteria you might not have enough to have teams and that will be very disappointing to many students parents and community members. If it doesn't get rid of teams it will limit the talent on the team. If your best athletes are averaging C' s then the other students will play and nobody likes a losing season.

I know your probably changing it to try to make the C average student to try harder to get better grades but that won't change most students. Some students won't even care if you take their sports away and the wont care about their grades either. Most students averaging a C probably don't care about their grades anyways. So really your not helping at all.

I feel very strongly about this opinion and I'm not even averaging C' s. I have an A average. That's how unfair I think changing the policy on sports participation is.

Sincerely,

An Angered Student
