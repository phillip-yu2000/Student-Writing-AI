It's cool to study different things about our Solar System, but some things in Space can be very dangerous, like trying to examine Venus closer. In the passage, it says, While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. I chose this piece of evidence because it talks about studying Venus, on how studying can be a worthing pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

In the beginning, it talks about Venus can be a very safe planet to research if we are far away from it. But it also says, if we get closer to it, it can be very dangerous since it is one of the hottest planets in our Solar System.

In the passage provided, it talks about Venus's temperature and it's thick atmosphere. Also talks about not being safe trying to get closer to it because it makes an example saying, "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

In the end, it talks about if you try and visit Venus, it's worth it not just because of insight, but because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our curiosity should lead us to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
