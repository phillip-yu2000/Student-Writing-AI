In my opinion I think driverless cars are kinda cool because of the fact that the driver doesn't have to do much of the driving. Alot of people can get tired while they are driving to where their destination is. Man people have to pull over and stop at motels or hotels to get siome rest, but with a driverless car the owner can be at their destination without having to stop anywhere.

With driverless cars you have to think about the facts that agt any time the car shut down and stop working but the car can alert you at anytime telling you that there is a problem with the system or something. The text provides a lot of interesting facts about theses types of new cars and on how several companies are in the process of testing them out. The text states that Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. After Google did it many other places started to follow after them like BMW who created the " Traffic Jam Assistant" which the car alerted the drivers when they needed to take over. Then, GM developed driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The driving laws focus more on keeping the drivers , passengers, and pedestrians safe and that was one of the major goals these companies wanted to achieve and they did. Tesla made a project that in 2016 this year a release for a car capable of driving on an autopilot 90% of the time. The cars they plan on working on are Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan to drive themselves by 2020.

Hopefully in the future people will be for driverless cars like me because the have some good benefits of human life in the future. People can read articles about the cars if they want to do background checks if they want to. I would love the fact that we would not have to drive the entire time if I was planning on a long trip, a lot of people will change their minds about driverless cars in the future because I did.
