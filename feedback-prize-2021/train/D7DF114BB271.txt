The ability of being able to read someones emotions can be a positive, but it can also have negative affects. Therefore I say im against this use of this type of technology. It is exposes problems like false detection, what about people with down syndrome, non accurate mental readings. Technology should not be released unless all problems are solved and are guarenteed to not happen.

In paragragh 6 it stated that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." Well FACS may be able to detect how people are feeling but what if the students expression is fake. Meaning what if the student is merely pretending to look confused or bored. Is FACS going to change the students lesson plan to something easier making the student work less and passing the assihnment easily?

In the begining paragraph 3 it explains that the process of FACS constructed by a 3-D model of the face and its 44 muscles. Being able to calculate and determine the facial muscles is vitial to the accuracy of this process. Lets say that a kid using a computer has down syndrome and his entire face is numb which has caused it to droup down substantually. How would the FACS process work then?

Lets say a student is having a bad day and doesnt want anyone to ask what is wrong; or how are you? Then that student gets the computer and puts a mask on. Meaning that he or she pretends to be happy or understanding about the lesson. But inside he or she is dying and wondering if they will have a happy mom or dad to go to. Will they get beaten again? Will there parents fight? Where are they going to sleep tonight?

A computer cant calculate what a person is feeling just by looking at there face it needs to know the back story of each individual student, what type of family they come from, their grades, etc. You cant judge a book by its cover, you have to read it to truly understand it.
