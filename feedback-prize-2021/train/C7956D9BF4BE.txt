Do you guys belive in aliens? Well,I got a friend over at NASA who does. And I'm here to tell you all about the Face on Mars. You know,the one that's been all over books and magazines for like the past 25 years. A lot of people think it was created by aliens,but I don't. Let me tell you why.

My first piece of evidence to put an end to this ludacrisy is that in April of 1998,Mars Global Surveyor flew over the an area of the Mars where the Face was spotted,Cydonia. Michael Malin and his orbit camera team took a picture of the face that was ten times sharper than the original photo from 1976. The picture,to everyones suprise but mine,revealed that there was no alien monument. The picture only showed a natural landform. However the phot was taken during a cloudy time of the year on Mars.

So,on April 8,2001 another photo was taken. This time a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Mars Global Surveyor used a camera that had each pixel span 1.56 meters. So even if the picture had a plane on it or small shacks,you could still see it. When the photo was taken it shows the Martian that resembles American lamdforms called buttes and messas. It even reminded a scientist of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

So I hope this can put away any ridiculous ideas about the Face being created by "aliens". This is all proof that what was thought to have been something mythical,was actually just a landform on Mars! Aliens do not exist. It's just that simple.
