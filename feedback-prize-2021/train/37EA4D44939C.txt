There are many reasons why you should be in the Seagoing Cowboy program. One reason why you should be in it is because it is an experience for you to go do something fun. Two, you also would get to explore the world, and take care of so many animals! Just think exploring the world, and taking care of animlals. Those are some reasons why you should join the program.

Some reasons why I claim the statements, is that if you don't have anything to do try the program. It keeps me busy all the time. If you like animlas, you would love this experience! The animlas have to be fed, and watered two or three times a day. Just think you could help the animlas if you tried the program!

In conclusion, the program is a very good opportunity because of all those reasons. If you have never explored the world before, you can by this program. You get the chance to be around so many anuimals. I thought the program was a very fun thing that everyone should try. You get to do so many fun, and interesting things, that it would help the other countries very much!
