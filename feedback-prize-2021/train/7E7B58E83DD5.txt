I think driveless cars are a positive thing today. Driveless cars are helping our future and making things a lot better for us now. Techology is being put to great use now with driveless cars.

The reason i think driveless cars are a positive thing is because they are helping save lives. The driveless cars are helping save lives everyday. The more techology we have, the better the cars become. They have alerts and different things to make sure the driveer knows what is going on and help to try avoid accidents from happening. For example BMW announced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant."

Driveless cars Can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. These are great things to have on a car to makes things a lot easier and safer for others and yourself.

The driveless cars are just an enhancement for humans and to help keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safer now.
