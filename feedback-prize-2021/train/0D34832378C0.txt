When you give someone advice, you have to give it like you mean it because then when that person tries it out, everything might go bad and they'll get embarrassed. If your friend needs help for a job interview, let them know to wear a suit, with a tie, and black dress shoes. Give them an idea to put on their resume. Just try to give advice that you personally think will work, and if doesn't, help again. But dont get too much pressure put on your back. When you help someone, theres always a certain point where it's just too much to keep helping, and thats okay. Let them know to ask someone else if you don't have anything to say. If there is too much pressure, try your absolute best.

If another friend needs help for what to wear on a night out, tell them what you personally think looks best and would wear on a special occasion. Make sure you tell them to have a good time and have fun. Tell your friends this if they want your help, and always wish them the the best.
