can autonomous cars be trusted? thats the question being brung up from this article because of the precariousness of how the car operates with no regulations to distinguish liability between consumers and the maufacturers. regulations on the smart cars autonomous functions are not even in the works yet as smart cars arent allowed and many states progress is a good thing and these new features for smart cars is what progress looks like, making driving easier and hassle free is what it seems to be aiming for, and while that can be seen the only problem is current traffic laws, what i mean by that is if the there are no current traffic laws that cover who would be liable in an event like if car malfunctions and causes an accident. it would be hard to decide if the problems with the car were caused by lack of care for car maintenace on the consumers side or rushed assembling on the manufacturers side but whie what i said is true it is also a small issue that can be remedied within a couple years with new breakthroughs in how the new features operate to be much more reliable in an event when they're needed and also when updated traffic laws are put into place to accomodate the new smart cars in conclusion while it could be dangerous to allow these cars to go in to a more widely public use i believe it should be put into developement as it is the next step for innovation in the automobile industry
