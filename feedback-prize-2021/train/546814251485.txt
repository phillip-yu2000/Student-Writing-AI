The school principle has decided that all students must participate in sports, work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. I think this is a great idea and will benefitÂ many people. This would make students more active better member of society and brighten the students future in life. It would benefit the school and sports teams as well by having smarter hard working students.

Schools have a lot of hardworking students but also have students who dont care and dont contribute to the school or themselves, making students participate in a sport, work on the year book, or serve on the student council would fix that. By making a student play sport you would make them work towards something out of school instead of just laying around, which would make the student a harder worker and benefit his grades. The sport would help the student have better ability to work with other people also giving them new friends to have fun with making school a more enjoyable place. Sports would also help the student become more healthy physically. Working on the yearbook or serving on the student council would benefit the student and the school in many ways such as giving students the opportunities to use there talants, and ideas to make the school a better place. Students could use there skills writing and putting pictures together or develope them while working on the yearbook. Serving on the student council, students could make changes to the school to better it for themselfs and others.

I agree with this idea for the stuents and the school. It would make the students helthier, hardworking, get better grades,and express there ideas and talants. This is a great idea and more schools should do the same thing.
