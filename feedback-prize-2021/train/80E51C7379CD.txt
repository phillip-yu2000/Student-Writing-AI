Online distance learning would be a horrible idea for Generic_School.

It gives an unfair advantage to students who have internet, it would be most likely poorly designed and hard to get working, and it probably wouldn't even function correctly.

First, the advantage it gives to certain students is, at minimum, completely unfair.

Imagine you're a student who lives in an area where your family can't get internet service. How would you feel if you were not doing so well in a class and someone else, with the same performance in class, suddenly got much better grades because of something you can't access. Like any student, you would probably be mad. Nobody should be left in the dust.

furthermore, Generic_School's inability to understand well designed tech would lead to the software used in it's online distance learning program being clunky and slow at best. The software would, most likely, barely work. Have you ever tried to use an app that was irritating and frustrating to use? Imagine having to use a program like that every single day. Its even worse that it has to have video capability. And even if you had good internet and the software is decent, Generic_SchoolÂ has the worst public internet I have ever seen. On a lucky day you can barely load Google.

And lastly, there is no promise that the software will be reliable enough to even use it. Imagine trying to use something that constantly crashes and lags all the time. It would be absolute chaos to get it to properly run for more that ten minuets straight.

In conclusion, online distance learning would be absolutely unfair and unusable to the point of even considering it is foolish and stupid at minimum.
