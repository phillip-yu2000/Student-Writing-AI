To the principal:

A recent problem that we have been facing is the school cell phone policy. I know that you are considering two possible policies and I would like to tell you my opinion on which policy is better for the student and the education matter.

Cell phones are a way for students to relax and spend their free time, but cell phones can be a major distraction, especially when it comes to education. I say that we should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

If we do not let the students bring the phones to school at all, they will feel restricted and will alternatively bring their cell phones to school. This will cause more of an absence of mind.

Letting the students use the phones only at free times will teach them trust and respect. Students will no be distracted in class and will have a good time. This way, they concentrate on school work as well as their other interests.

This is my opinion and proposal on the school's cell phone policy. I hope you will consider my idea and thank you for your time.

-Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
