If I were a scientist at NASA, I would show many resons why the "Unmasking the Face on Mars" was not created by aliens. First, I would ask them "why" do they think aliens are real. With there own proof. Once I would get a response, I would tell them there isn't much proof that aliens exist. Including, that there are also no signs of life on Mars.

Also, I would also state that the Face was only a natural landform of a mesa, made by natural causes on planet Mars. It was probably most likely made by a sandstorm. But, surely not made by an alien. I would also tell the person who I am arguing with, that aliens are just fictional characters in movies, book, etc. made up by normal people.

Another important reason thhat you can tell that the Face on Mars is only a landform is that in the pictures show, the face has more features as a normal mesa. And you can tell because of the more advanced technology to improve the photos shown. With that reason you would point out how the face has revalent features of a landform. To prove that statement in the text, it states that the landorm just appears as an Egyptian Pharaoh face because of the shadows on Mars.

With all of this information I would've proved that aliens didn't form the Face on MArs.
