Dear Principle

I have heard about your decision to change the grade average to be able to play sports. I respect that decision but I don't agree with it. I am a student athlete here attending your school and even though i have an A average i have friends who have C averages and are wonderful athletes. Yes The policy is agreeable and it has benefits to make students get better grades. Yes it is going to make students try harder in the classroom. There also a down fall to that decision. If the policy gets changed will the work get easier? There's got to be a reason most students have a C average and i believe its because the work is to hard.

Sports are a very important roll in me and my friends life's. It keeps us out of trouble in and out of the classroom. sometimes When our work is too hard or if we just don't feel like doing it we start to slack. Now since we have sports we actually do our work. C averages are a pretty good grade. I know we can do better sometimes but what if the work is way too hard and we try our best and get help on all of our subjects. Then we still make the same grades. Its probably one of the two reasons. The work is too hard or the teacher is not teaching the correct way.

I think that the decision that has been made to change the grade average is fair. Some people like the change, preferring parents mostly and then some people do not like it at all, preferring the students. Then there is some students who think that the decision is a fair deal because it will keep there grades up. That's a very good way to get a scholarship and receive what you have earned over all the time that you have put into it.
