Driverless Cars is good way to help a driver when they are tired and they can take a break from the stairing wheel. The good thing about Driveless cars is that they can drive by themself under specific conditions. Google has had driveless cars that have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.

I think it's a good idea to make drivelss cars because it's interesting and this will help people out a lot especially when they are tired of staring the wheel and they need to sit back and relax, but I mean they will still be alerted to take over the wheel when they are dealing with traffic and accidents the care will warn them.

No matter what, theirs always going to be an accident and you can't blame the car for it, accedents happen and it can either be the other person in the other car or you. If you have a driveless car and you are taking a break but you still have the responsibility to stay on tract and have an eye on the road and not be texting it's still dangerous even though if it's a driveless car. Driveless cars can steer, acclerate and brake themselves but they are all designed to notify the driver when its neccasary.

Driveless cars can also help people who don't know how to drive it can help them out if the person is going to fast it can slow them down.

In 2016 Telsa is realeasing a car that is capable of driving outopilot 90% of the time. In 2020 their will be cars like Mercedes, Benz, Audi, and a Nisaan that will be alble to drive by themselves I think have driveless cars is a good idea.
