Imagine you're stuck on a problem, and you have no idea how to fix it. You've tried to think of several solutions, but none seem to come to mind. Going to people you trust for advice is one of the best ways to help you in any situation. When asking for advice, it's best to go to more then one person and seek multiple opinions, because with many opinions, you get more solutions, point of views, and support to help you make the better choice. The more opinions you get, the more thought out solution you can make for a choice best fit for you.

When you're in a problem, there are many ways to get out of it. Having many people say their opinion gives you many solutions to any given situation. Some people might give you the easiest way, while others might give you a more thorough way to get out of a problem. For example, when I'm in an argument with a friend, I like to go to people I trust and ask them the best way to handle the argument. Some may say to drop the friend and move on with my life, while others might give me ways to talk to my friend and fix the issue. In that moment I have many ways to help my problem, and I can choose which way to follow based on what I believe to be the best for me and my friend.

With other people there to help you solve an issue, they give you what they see on the situation so you have a better understanding of the problem. Different points of view give you the idea of where a misunderstanding may have occurred, or what you need to work on for future references. For example, when I become frustrated with a friend, other people's points of view could show me where I might have misunderstood what my friend was trying to say. With that information, I can solve the conflict with my friend and know what I could work on when communicating with people so the problem doesn't occur again.
