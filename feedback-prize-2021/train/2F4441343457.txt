Dear Principal,

I believe that policy one would be the best choice for the students and the school for two reasons. First, what if there was someone with something that could harm the school. Second, the student would need their phone with them if they need to call their parents to get home if the school office was closed. So I hope you read my reasons carefully and think about your decision.

My first reason I think we should have our cell phones is because, there could be someone in the school with something that could put everyone on campus in danger. So if the teacher aren't able to get to the office phone a student could pull out there phones and call the police, before something really happen. For example, what if a student brought a gun to school to scare some of the other students because they were bullying him. Someone could call the police before anything got out of hand, or they could talk him out of it. But i believe we all would like someone to call the police for no one would get hurt.

The second reason I think we should be able to have our phones at school is because, what if we have a event like: softball or volleyball game, and it was cancelled at a late notice and no one had their phone or their key to the house, because they were not able to go home after school because the game was real early. Then, they wouldn't be able to get in their house or call their parents to tell them that they need to get in the house and that their game was cancelled.

So our phones at school would be helpful for emergencies, and getting a way home from school or to a event because the event was to early. Therefore, I really hope you take a chance to read my opinion on why students should have their cell phones to school, and make a wise decision on what police you choose after you read my letter.

Yours truly,
