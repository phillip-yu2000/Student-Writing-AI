When my friend told me about how he was going Europe and wanted me to go, I was the happiest man alive. I was happy that I was going to Europe, but even happier that I was going to be a part of the United States Relief and Rehabilitation program. On this program you have the chance to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. This is a wonderful opertunity for everyone to take.

I said that the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. We have fun doing our work and also have fun with our extra time. When the animals our dropped of, on the way home we play games such as table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whilltling. This games help us pass time do we are never bored.

When I was little in worked on my aunt Katie's farm which had prepared me for the dangers at sea. On my second trip I served as a watchman. My jobs was to check on the animals every hour and report back to the captain. I was running back to the animals when I almost fell over the rail. There are a lot of fun things to do on the job, but there are also some risks you take.

I am very grateful for this opportunity because it made me more aware of animals and people of other counties and their needs. This awareness stays with me leading me family to host a number of international visits for many year after.
