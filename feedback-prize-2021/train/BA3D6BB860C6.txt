Dear principal,

I think it is a big thing to help with our community to help keep it clean and to help keep are community smart , it would not be bad to make everybody to do community service because everyone needs to know how to do that and to make a difference in our lives and communities i think it would be great to do that and im glad for people that have already done it and i think it would be a big help with people that are not a good learner like needs help and stuff i think that it would be great for that too. i would help in so many ways and i think if it is just our school then so be cause that just shows we are trying to help our community in different ways. or if it happens where we cant do it i think it should be a punishment for the kids that do get in trouble. and yes i understand where it takes a lot of there time well if they just did it for just an hour or 30 min. that would be great. cause 30 min is a lot of time to help but i was just going to tell you i think it is a great idea even if some people don't like the idea i still think you should do it or you should do it for punishment so that they would not get in trouble no more especially if they don't like doing that. so i thought i would just give you my opinion this and to tell you it is not a bad idea it is a good idea.

thanks.
