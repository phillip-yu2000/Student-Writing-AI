We should keep the electoral college because. It will allow votes to have a certainty of outcome, Requires a trans-regional appeal, and finaly to avoid run-off elections. This list will be baised on reasons and facts that i think will be sutible for my reason you may have your own facts and opinions but remember anyone can say what they think so this is what i think. Now let us begin.

First off i want to start with on how it will allow votes to have a certainty of outcome. In the source 3: in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president by:Â  Richard A. Ponser he talks about that a dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Also he talks about winner-take-all basis, and that even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in the state. From what i understand is that electoral college helps create a winner-take-all basis.

Second i would love to disscuse how it requires a trans-regional appeal. In source 3

he talks about how the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (south, northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful
