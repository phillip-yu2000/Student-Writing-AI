I don't like it that us students has to have a B average just to play sports because most students has a C average i don't think it is right. Its wrong for you to change the policy because it will be hard to play sports or other activities and keep a B average. I know school work is more important than sports but sports in what I am trying to get a scholarship in.

I think we should just keep it as it is a C average to play sports and if we fail then its our faults not ours you can kick us off of the team or whatever until we get our grades back up. I think it would be easier in us just to keep it as C average i know life is hard and we have to learn but try to make it as less painful as possible.

If you want to change the rules than you can but you will be seeing a lot of athletes quitting because lack of getting that B average. I know you want us to do good in school and do good in sports and in school but its hard when we have to have a B average and get into shape for football, baseball, basketball. Etc.

The only way your going to be seeing a bunch of athletes is if you decide to keep the average at a C average. I know this letter may not mean anything to you but please listen and keep it the way it is. you shouldn't change it just to make kids do better in school you should kelp kids achieve in life in school and in sports.
