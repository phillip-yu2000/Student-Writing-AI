Dear Principal,

Some students perform community service. Some tutor elementary students and others clean up litter. They take this task seriously. However, many other students who do not wish to partake have the perspective that community service is time consuming, and unnecessary to complete. For this reason, I do not believe that community service should be mandatory and required. For example, many students feel that this duty will take away their privilege to get what they need and what they want to do. For the unwilling students, I think making community service mandatory will also effect their work performance in school, since all their time would be invested into this service and not into their studies. However, for the willing individuals who insist in participating community service, they have their own choice and judgement to join or not, therefore the decision was none other than their own. In conclusion, I hope you consider the idea of making community service optional and not mandatory, as students can make their own choices, and decide on whether or not they would like to participate.
