There are some advantages and some disadvantages for having and not having a car. U need a car just incase for an emergency and then there is an a advantege for no having a car and that is less pollution in the air.

First I like to talk about the disadvanteges for not having a car. not having a car means more walking or bike riding  and then there is always being late to work or being late to something because you do not have a car to drive. people need to have a car because they have to go to work everyday are just to go have fun or go anywhere.

The Second disadvatege for not having a car is when there is an emergency. If there is an emergency hiow are you going to get to the hospital or to the doctors if you dont have a car. Having a car is beteter than not having a car. For an example if a person gets hurt and needs to go to the hospital how are they going to get there if they dont have a car.

The Third the thing I like to to talk about is the advantages for not having a car. Not having a car will help people got more excersice and help them move about around. Not having a car will help with having more money to spend on food or going out with freinds or family.

The Fourth reason why we shouldnt have a car is having less pollution in the air. Also not having a car a will help with the space or room you need Cars can take up alot of space. Cars are also expensive. some people think its bad to have a car because they are expensive. Without cars you will see lots of people walking or running around.

There is advantages and disadvanages for not having a car. Some reasons are good and some reasons are bad.
