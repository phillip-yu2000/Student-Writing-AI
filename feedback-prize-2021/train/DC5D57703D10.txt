Do you think students should do community service?

Well i think they should because its to many kids on they street doing things that they don't got business doing an it a same that their like this.

I think that if students do community service it will help the environment plus help the lots orderly residents needing the help in their homes.

An I think that students should take more interest in helping day cares, cleaning up the parks volunteering in helping teachers in elementary schools

If students help the teachers in elementary school the teachers will not have to leave their students unattended with no supervision. They can go make where they need to go an com back. Also at day cares if the sitter need help with entertaining the kids you got someone to do it for you an to keep them quiet, bring a snack when its time to eat, or read a book when its time take a nap. Last if the students clean the parks up for us the kid wont have to worrie about they kids getting hurt or the baby's eating something they don't have no business. Therefore I think that students should do community service.
