I am going everywhere trying to find out the opinions of our city about, whether or not I should get a pet dog. Also nobody gets why I need more than one person to answer this big question.

The reason why I need more than one opinion from the people of Generic_City. Is because everyone has a different opinion and I want to know all of them. Also it will help by putting them all together and then coming up with a great response. Therefore I went through the city and the park asking a variety group of people the same question. Also all of there answers were the same but different .

Now I am putting everyone opinions together , because not everyone is going to say yeah you should get one. Therefore I want to know why that is that they would say no , and should I consider that reason not to get a dog. But I loved how I asked multiple people and not just one that helped so so much. Using different people opinions help when you are making a big decision because they probably have made it too. Also , It will help with a lot of upcoming things now I know to ask more than one person.

Also seeking the help of others was a good thing that I did. Because I feel like if I only got one person's advice that I would not really know if I wanted a dog or not. Another example I remember asking my family if I should buy air pods or clothes for the trip I was going on. Then they all had someting to say some of them were like clothes because you already have headphones just save up for them a different time , the other were like you should buy the air pods you have a lot of clothes. It was a very hard decision but I made up my mind I went of the clothes because I already had headphones and majority of my family said that. Therefore I think asking multiple people is better than just getting one opinion.
