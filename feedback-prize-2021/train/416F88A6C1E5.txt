Phones and Driving

Cell phone have become very popular over the past few years. According to the iPhone the world is going crazy over them. There are about 7.53 billion people in this world and 3.3 billion people have phone. Some people use their phones for good reasons, for example, they may need to use their GPS but 50 percent of the time this is bad because the people would be more force on the directions then the road and 9 times out of 10 this will cause a car wreck! This is not safe at all.

People should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it's a distraction. When using a cell phone in the car you must look down and not up, when operating a car, you must be looking straight ahead and watching for red lights and stop sign. Also, must be watching for other cars when those cars are not paying attention.

Another reason you shouldn't use you phone and drive because you're more likely to found at fault for the accident that you may cause. Insurance rate hike, consider your passengers, consider other motorists, protect the pedestrians. It only takes a few seconds to park your car and use the phone. Its better if people should just use hand-free mode to regrade the racks and insurance.
