"Joining Seagoing Cowboys"

According to the text, Luke stated that on his trips he was on a cattle-boat and that it was an amazing experience for him. The text also states that besides him helping people he got to oversee Europe and China, and if you joined you would get to see even more. Luke also got to tour a excavated castle in Crete, so if you went you would probably see something even better.

The text also stated that joining the "Seagoing Cowboys" you get to care for animals during the crossings and you had to feed them and give them water to keep you busy. Also going to join the "Seagoing Cowboys" you have to be prepared for dangers at sea, because if your not you might have something horribly happen to you because you might get the nightwatch job and have to check things and make sure everythings okay and might fall or slip in the process.
