Dear Principal,

I think that it should be a grade C average to be in sports or other activities. Most student try their hardest just to get a C average to be barely passing to play in sports. Also most students can't stay focus on what they are learning and have to get help from one of their classmates witch they don't get the full help that the teacher gave the class. One reason why they wouldn't get the full understanding is because the student that he or she gets the help from then they may not be able to tell her or him what the teacher taught the classmates a easier way on how to do the work.

For example, for math, the teacher may be teaching them on how to set up proportions and one or two students aren't paying attention and when the teacher gives them their assignment he or she don't understand on how to do the proportions because they weren't paying attention. So if they go ask a classmate that did pay attention they don't show him or her on how to set it up just how to do the work. And that's why i think that the student should get a grade C average instead of a grade B average.

Also they may want to try harder to get a grade B average to improve their grades so that they don't have to worry about failing or barely passing. And its better to know that your doing good in a class instead of knowing that your barely passing in a class.

Students may love the activity or sport that he or she is in, and if their failing then they may be sad that they can't play in the game or participate to the activity that they are in. They would really like it if they could play in the sport that they are in or participate in the activity that he or she is in.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
