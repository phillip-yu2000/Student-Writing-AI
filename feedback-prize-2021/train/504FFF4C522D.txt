Phones and driving

Distracted drivers kill one in ten people everyday in the United States and injure 1500. Texting is one of the main distractions that cause these drives to kill and injure people. While texting you aren't focused on things that matter like the road and that causes these types of accidents to happen. People don't realize how serious this is, the driver might lose control of the car and their reaction time won't be fast enough. In 2011, accidents involving a distracted driver killed 3,331 people.

Habits like texting and driving are important to break. An example of a simple solution to this problem is to simply turn off your phone, it will block out buzzers or vibrations that will tempt anyone to check their phone. Many states in the United States have already passed the no texting and driving law. People still believe that texting and driving is no big deal and have confidence they can text and drive simultaneously. However. Lots of teens spend 15% of their time not in their lane.

With the advanced technology we have today, we should be using voice activated responses and apps to tell people when someone is driving and they'll get to them shortly. Preventing texting and driving can be a simple problem to overcome but very difficult. But if everyone works hard to make it happen we could be saving many lives everyday. If the situation is so important to put someone else's life in danger then why drive at all? Because in reality one text or call could wreck it all.
