Dear, Principal

I believe that students should be allowed to have cell phones in school. But only can have them outside of class. If they have them during class they could be cheating on home work and on tests. I think that the first policy should go into play. The students should be able to have phones in their free time. Because if they get a call concerning family or friends they should know firsthand not being told by a teacher or another student.

But if they have them on in class they should get taken away. Because of the possibility of cheating or making fun of others through cyber bullying on cell phones. That is one thing that could get out of hand. And the school could have a big problem on their hands because of cell phones. They should not have cell phones in class they will also cause a big distraction to other students that get distracted easily and have a hard time staying on task.
