Hello TEACHER_NAME, :D <3

Well, you already know me, STUDENT_NAME, i just wanna say that even though people have low grades (in the 60's] or a C average they should still have the right to be in any sports or activity they want to be in, because they want to be part of something in the school activities. & by the way, people will try to put their grades up if they want to be in the sport they like, but if they don't even try to put their grades up to be in the sport/activity they like then why bother having them ?

Well, what i' m trying to say that the ones that should stay in which ever activity they want are the ones that really want to part of it, try to do better in class, does their work/homework everyday, participates in class everyday, & try's their BEST & not the ones that are not even trying to put their grades up, not even doing their work in class, or not bothering to do ANYTHING.

Trust me, MOSTLY everybody wants to be in a sport/activity but they cant because they have C average. You should give a chance to the people that really want to be in something to actually be in what they wanna be in ! :D

What should be a "rule" for every activity is that the student should:

Show their report cards or progress report anytime they get them to the person who is in charge in which activity they're in to see if they put their grades up or not.

Trust me, MOSTLY everybody wants to be in a sport/activity but they cant because they have C average. You should give a chance to the people that really want to be in something to actually be in what they wanna be in ! :D
