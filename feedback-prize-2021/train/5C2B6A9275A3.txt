The use of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because the teachers can recoginze what is happening to the students or what they need. it will also be helpful for the students when they don't dare to ask or somthing that they can't explain.

The matchine are exact and they are able to detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. This new technology is the latest innovation from Prof. Eckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic emations. They are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All of the emotions associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit". The software read people's face and tell what is happening to them. Dr. Huang observes that,"The facial expressions for each emotions are universal". For example, our frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises our eyebrows when we are surprised.

Using a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Imagine a computer knows when we are happy or sad. Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructors. sometimes, it is hard for the teachers to guess the students. Human may know 50% of what they need acording to face emtions but the Face Action Coding System might know about 90% of human,s emotions by scanning their faces.

Therefore, the use of the latest software is good to express the emotions of students in a classroom is very valuable because it saves time and also can offer the students what they really want. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.
