I don't agree with changing it because sometimes students cant help that they don't have a B average or higher in all their classes. Teachers are a big thing that helps you in a class or tears you down in a class. If you don't understand the teacher or don't understand the class or even don't get along with the teacher then that can change the way you work and act in the class. You could only be missing a B by 1 or 2 points and that means you cant play any sports until that is a B average and sports are important for some kids. I believe it should be determined by your homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Sports are important to some kids and all but they have to be abill to do good in class as wail as in there chosen sport. In personal reference i am pushed to do good in school and i am unable to do sports until i bring my grades or grade to a passing average. That's one of my family's rules no sports if there is not all passing grades on report card. I personally know many students that live to play sports and come to school to play sports and they try their hardest in class but don't always achieve their goals in the classroom so that means they cant play. That's why i believe it should be averaged on homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Other family's might think differently about it than i do but this is how i feel about being abill to play sports as long as you are doing well in all of your classes.
