Having driverless cars is a great idea, but it could also be bad. It all depends on the person in the car and what types of decisions they're making. I think the world could work better with these cars. Although I also believe that these types of cars can be dangerous.

If businesses and manufacturers really wanted to, they could make these dream cars a reality. The cars that we have now are pretty close to being completly driver independent. All we would need to do is give the cars a few more updated sensors to replace the drivers. The updated sensors would act as the human reflexes; therefore creating better driving conditions. Hopefully this would create less wrecks or accidents.

Also these driverless cars should have updated satelites and cameras, so when there is a detour or road construction it will automatically update the cars route. This will help backed up traffic a lot. If these cars could have the best technology that's out there today, they would already be a success. For now that's the only thing that's keeping the cars from success.

Some people may be worried about the safety of these cars becasue at any moment in time there could be a glitch in the computer software, and that small glitch could cause an accident any second of any day. I, on the other hand, am not worried about that, becasue even if one car has a giltch there will be many other smartcars on the road to help avoid an accident. That's why these cars should definatley be on the road.

The driverless cars are coming, and they're almost here. All they need are a few more technological updates and they'll be completly ready for the road. And once they hit the ground it'll all be smooth driving from there.
