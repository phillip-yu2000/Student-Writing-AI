Luke didnt know what was going to happen after high school graduation. He was working at a grocery store and a bank(part time).His friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He didnt want to say no and he knew this will be an opportunity of a lifetime. He joined the program he wanted to do something together w/ his friend. He wanted to joined the program because he to try something new why he had the chance.

He signed up to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Being a Seagoing Cowboy,you have to take care of animals such as, horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke didnt want to just work for a grocery store and a bank, he wanted to do something else like being a Seagoing Cowboy. Would you like to keep working at a grocery store and bank? I wouldn't because, I would want to try the opportunity that is offered and see what will happen.

Luke had to make alot of trips to get to where he was getting to. He made 9 trips. People thought that it was unbelievable opportunity for a smalltown boy. He says that he had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. He thinks the Acropolis in Greece was special. Luke also tuored an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.
