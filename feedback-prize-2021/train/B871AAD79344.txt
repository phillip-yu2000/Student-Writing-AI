I agree with this decision, because it makes school less boring and depressing if students have something to do other than sitting in a quiet room like robots listening to the teacher and being told what to do all day without being able to talk without raising their hands so taking a elective gives them a chance to have a little bit of freedom.

Doing something other then school work helps with stress because you can do something you want to do because doing something you don't want to makes you have stress.

Sports is also a good extracurricular activity because kids in america get fat and obese so they don't want to do any sports or and they don't stop eating unhealty foods because they lose motivation to care for them self but school can the school extracurricular can help them gain some motivation to start working out.

Kids that have problems with getting friends because their anti social or something can find their own group of friends if he likes computers he can sign up for the coding or computers and arts to find other people that had the same intrests as him or her.
