If our principal was to take sports or any curricular activities away then a lot of people would be devastated. The reason being is because if you had a favorite sport/hobby then you wouldn't be able to do it because your principal took it away. I think taking away some bodies favorite thing to do is like taking a child away from his or hers parents. The reason being is because if playing football was something you really focused on and your principal took that away from you then you wouldn't be able to practice and go on to pursue your dreams as a football player. I feel like taking our activities away is unfair to everyone. I mean if you think about it that's how so many people join gangs and commit crimes. Its all because they don't have a sport or an activity to do but besides killing or shooting someone. To me you shouldn't just take away all activities because people have C as there grade point averages.
