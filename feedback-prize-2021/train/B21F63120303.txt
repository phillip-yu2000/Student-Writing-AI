Dear Principle,

I think student should be doing community service because in my opinion students should do community service because when they are leaning about the environment community service could show them what helping the community can do for them and their earth. I think the students in the school should have this opportunity to help out in their community. They will learn by them helping their community people just might realize they should help out in what should be more done around their community.

students will understand more about what good they will bring to there community if they help out, examples: picking up trash in local parks, recycling plastic bottles and soda cans. if more people would help out in their community more often on their free time personal i think the community we live in now will be more happier to live in. I honestly recommend that student in our school should be apart of helping their community, taking care of what they live in. I think it would also show the students how to be more safe and more aware of what they can do to make there community allot better and happier to live in.

The most simplest things that your students in your school could do by recycling, throwing their trash away instead of throwing it on the ground and would help more then anyone could possible imagine. Your students could have a fundraiser to make helping their community fun to do and they would also be showing other out of school what they can do as well to help out their community and with the simplest things. Many people think that helping their community is boarding and not worth doing, but if u really think about it helping our community would make a great change in how people would think about what they lived in.

So what I'm trying to get at is that not only it would help our community i think it would help our school learn how to take care of were we live and make it a better place.
