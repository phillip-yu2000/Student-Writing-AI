Driving while using a cellular device is very dangerous, but it can be useful at certain times. The use of cellphones ranges from informational, to recreational activities. The use of cellphones during driving can be catastrophic not many people have the skills to watch the road and their phone at the same time. The fact of the matter is that it's too dangerous to let people use cell phones while they drive, the accidental crashes that happen each year would skyrocket. I advocate for a ban of drivers using cellphones while driving.

"Approximately 660,000 drivers try and use cellphones behind the wheel of an automobile" according to edgarsnyder. com. This is extremely risky as not being focused while driving can lead to death by car crash, not just for the driver at fault but everyone in the crash. The drivers of America need to be attentive when operating a vehicle because of: pedestrians, stop signs, public and or private property, cars, trucks, etc. The mortality rate of people in car crashes are very high, and the property damages done are very extreme, not to mention that it can cause problems later in life as well. Overall it's not even worth the trouble to use your cellular device while driving.

To look at the perspective through another person's shoes is the key to understanding why this is true. The thought of leaving this world or being the cause of someone else leaving this world is enough for me not to even think about using a cellphone while driving. The hearts of the family members who had their loved ones taken away makes me tear up. A great man once told me, "all life is precious and it is not up to man but our creator to take it away. " There is nothing more wrong than knowing that you took a human life and that is the reason I think cellular device use during driving, should be illegal.
