I think that the author is suggesting that studying venus is worth a pursuit despite the dangers. because they can find different types of species and able to figure out if there is life/organism. And NASA is trying to figure out methonds on how the could have their equipment not damage or destroyed by how hot the temperature their is

. And NASA might use silicon carbide for the projects for venus and NASA is going to use a old technology called a mechanical computers the deviced was made in the 1800s and was played a important role in 1940s in world war II.

But the device can caculate only using lever and gears. But the problem of modern technology it has it's pros and cons the pros is that it's powerful, flexible,and quick. and cons is that it's very delicate when it's in on extreme physical comditions.

NASA is going to send people to study venus but the surface might be to extreme for but the the scientist are going to foalt abpve ground like around 30 feet or more but the surface of venus is extremly hot like around 170 degress Fahreheit

(Now that hot) but Earth,venus,and mars are some what close to each other kinda like neighbors.

Venus has it's atomsphere very thick almost 97%of almost pure carbon dioxide blankets now thats a lot. it's challenging bevause the clouds have a high corrosive sulfuric acid in venus and the average temperature is around 800 degrees Faherheit! and the atmospheric to be more scientific the pressure around venus atmopshere is around 90 times greater thaat what we have on earth and the conditions on venus is far more extreme then any other human ever experience on our own planet.
