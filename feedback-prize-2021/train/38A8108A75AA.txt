Arguments over whether we should limit car-usage has been an importamt topic through out the world. Even though there are some set backs, the advantages are tempting.

in Germany, almost everyone has learned to do with less usage of cars since 2006. I thinnnk the twon should be able to do as they please. passengers cars are responsible fpr 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.

In paris, driving has been suspended due to growing amounts of fog. after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Cold nights and war days caused the warmwer layer of air to trap car emissions. If the driving roads are not safe, then they should create a driving ban on people for safety.

I strongly belive that we should limit out car use in order to achieve safety for the people. We can take buses that can hold 30 people instead of each person driving their own car. that would make a huge differnce.
