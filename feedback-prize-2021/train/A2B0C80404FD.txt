Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. People do a lot of things with cellphone, but they should never be able to use phones while driving a vehicle. There are many reasons why you shouldn't. Car crashes, running red lights, and death.

First is car crashes. Car crashes are very common, sometimes it can be because people don't know how to drive, but they are mostly caused because of people looking down at their phone instead of looking at the road. These are liabilities because you can really hurt someone or even take their life. Texting and social media are taking all of the attention away from you looking at the road. Why not be smart and just put the phone down for a few minuets and just relax and drive. It can save a life

Next is running red lights. Think about all of the things that can happen if you run a red light. A major ticket, a bad crash, and even a life. Just all of the bad things that can happen. Just putting the phone down can prevent all of the bad things that can happen to you and your loved ones. Say your driving on a major highway, maybe I-95, there is an intersection in the middle of the road and you need to see the red light because its about to turn. If your looking at your phone and miss the light you can cause a major disturbance in traffic.

Last is death, Think about how many people you can kill in a car crash. Your driving and you pick up your phone and miss a turn, you hit a car and that car hits 5 more cars and sets off a chain reaction, All of those people have a probability of dying because of how fast your going and how hard you hit them. Now you can be charged with murder and that gives you life in prison. So think about that about that before picking up your phone.

In conclusion all of these reason are why you should not be able to use your phone while driving.
