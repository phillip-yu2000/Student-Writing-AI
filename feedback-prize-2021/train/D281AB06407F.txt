Have you heard of the Seagoing Cowboys Program? Well, It is a program that you will be able to take care of mules, young cows, and horses that were shipped over seas. You should join because it is helping Europe and Asia take care of animals and supplies.

One reason to join is that you help animals travel from one place to another. You will be helping European and Asian countries recover their animals, food supplies, and more. You will visit many countries helping them recover and saving animal's lives as well. And I was happy with what I was doing.

As I said in the first paragraph you will travel to many places. You will able to have some free time when you are at a country because I got to travel to Crete and see an excavated castle and also marveled at the Panama Canal. It was fun to travel all over the world to help people.

On this trip I learned my way around a few countries and how it feels to help people just because you want to. You might get hurt along the way but at least you are doing what is right. By doing this I was drafted into the military when I turned 18 and when they learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. So as I did I saw how much distruction wars could do. By that I became aware of what people need.

To sum up my thoughts, I think you should join The Seagoing Cowboys Program because you are helping animals and people, you visit many places, and you learn things along the way. And I have exprience of getting hurt during these trips but that should not stop you from helping your world go through horrifying events. So, in future reference I advice you to do what is right no matter what.
