Dear TEACHER_NAME

It has come to my attention that you want to change our schools policy so that students cannot participate in sports or any other activity unless they have a B average.

My comment on that would be that most students in class have a C average therefore they wouldn't be able to be on any of our schools teams and if you don't have any students on a team then there wouldn't be a team at all. therefore you wouldn't have a sports department, now i know you care about the education of your students and there well being, but lets be reasonable, if there aren't any students at the extra activities such as, dances, games, fund raisers, etc. then we wouldn't have enough money to provide the school with the materials a school basically needs.

Now on the other hand i do realize and understand were your coming from TEACHER_NAME, some students don't deserve to go to extra activities or be on a team, but i think that if a student is on a team it will encourage them to bring up there grades academically and also students want to go to games and other fun things so i think that they wont just be going to school and doing things that bore them.

I would hate going to school knowing that there's a game later that same day and i couldn't go just because i had or had a C average.

so those are my reasons.

sincerely
