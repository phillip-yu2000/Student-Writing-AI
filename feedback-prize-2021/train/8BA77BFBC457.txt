Limting car usage is good because of so many ways.. For one, cities all over the world are starting to do more and more about this problem all the time. All of these have been making a huge impact of the massive amounts of smog and pollution created by cars. Owning a car is very expensive anyways.

The massive amounts of pollution in the air is convincing large amounts of people and governments to start creating societies and communities that are car free, or very expensive to own cars in. In some cases of extreme pollution, the government has made it so the next few days, there would be no cars allowed, except taxis and buses. The results from both of these have been very possitive. When France had issued one of the days, the results were 60 % less in on of the most polluted cities in the world.

Cars are responsible for 12% of the greenhouse gasses in Europe. The United States is one of the largest users of cars in the world, so what does that says about us? So many parts of the world use cars for daily parts of their jobs and lives. Some of these include delivery companies, and other jobs with 50% use of automobiles.

With all of the plans of less car usage, prices are going up. Fines on no-driving days, fees to park your car, and lets not forget the one thing you need for your car, gas. Especialy with the cost of gas going up it is cheaper to buy a bike, than to ride a car.

Those are the reasons why limiting car usage is a good idea, pollution, and fees, not to mention every action from governments.
