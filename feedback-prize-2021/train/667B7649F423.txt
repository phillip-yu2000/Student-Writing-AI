In the passage "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author gives reasons why the car would be nice to have, but they also give reasons why it would not be good to have. Even though having a car drive you around would be nice, to me the benefits of driving yourself around are so much more than thoughs of having a car drive you around. Having a car driving you around all the time can create many dangers to the people around you, possible malfunctions can occur to the car, and the joy of driving your own car around would be lost.

The dangers of having a car drive you around would be that the human brain is marter than a computer. We can determain situations better in person than a computer can however many miles away from it you are. While computers are more logistically smarter than humans, we have experiance in everyday life to help us determain how to drive more efficantly.

Havong a self driving car is a great advancment in the technilogical field, but what is saying that there would not be malfunctions. If you are driving approxamently 70 miles on the interstate and the car malfunctions, there can be major risks to your safety and the safety of those around you.

Lastily, when you were little you would always dream about driving your own car one day, but if you have a car driving you around you would lose that freedom feeling. Also, today a lot of people like to drive around when they are streesed because it helps them get there mind off of things, but if you have a car driving you around places you lose the stress free driving time because you are not controling the car.

There is some benefits of having a car drive you around. Some say that the benefits are better than the reasons why we should not have them. But, to me, driverless cars are taking to much away from us and putting us at to much risk to be a good thing.
