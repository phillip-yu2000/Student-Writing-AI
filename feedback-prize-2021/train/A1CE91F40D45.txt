Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There are many different ways this may affect our school. In good ways and bad. For all we know if students really care about their sports like me, I'm almost positive this will make them make better grades.

But also, at a school like this, where we have tremendous athletes, they might not stop playing sports because they would rather slack off. If that's the case then you would have a lot on your hands to deal with from parents.

I'm also sure that you will be hearing a lot of complaints, not just from our students, but other schools too. You might set an example that most kids look at as a punishment and other schools might fallow in your footsteps. Because the rule has always been a "C" average I do not think that you should change the policy for just our school. That seems unfair.

Get this rule approved by the SCHOOL_NAME so all schools have to change it if you really want it to be different, but don't just change it for us.

And a "C" isn't failing. I mean it's not the best grade in the world but its not nearly the worst. You don't have to go to 9th period if you have a "C". You don't have to go to summer school if you have a "C". So why should you not be aloud to play sports if you have a "C".

Sincerely- STUDENT_NAME
