Is the FACS (known as the Facial Action Coding System) a good idea to read the emotional expessions of students in a classroom valuable? I agree that it is, the reason why I agree to that cause it can help students show their emotions when they are scared to, and in the future it can really come in handy.

The reason why it can help students show their emotions when they are scared to is that because what if a student is in class and they are sad but they just don't wanna say or tell someone, well from the FACS it can show when the perosn is sad.

In the text it shows that from this new technology it can really come in handy in the future by the more we use it and explore with it, it can help with us by first making animated videos, like in games, movies, short films etc. that would come in handy cause by then things will be really easy.

In conclusion to my side is that I think its a good idea to start spreading the FACS around this will do good in the future and we can't make it good if we don't explore and make it spread cause i'm for sure know that this will be good for our society maybe for the whole world.
