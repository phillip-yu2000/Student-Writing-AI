Did you know that there has been an ongoing debate between Nasa and the society? The debate is about whether or not the imprint on mars's platform that appears to be a face, was created by a natural cause or by an alien. I had done some scientific study on the situation myself, being that I am a scientist and I believe that the imprint was indeed made naturally.

some eveidence to back up my claim would be that in paragraph 12 of the article i used as a part of my scientific study is that what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. This reminds another scientist named garvin, of the middle butte in idaho. A middle butte is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. This is proof that the imprint was made naturally and not by an alien because lava domes are made naturally which is what the face on mars is.

In conclusion, my opinion is that the face on mars was made naturally on the platform. I have done research on this very subject and i am positive that my hypothesis is right.
