If you have been wanting to go seight-seeing, you will get to see lots of nature's art from a distance where you can see it all not just once, but many times.

If you are concerned about the time issues, no worry, there are plenty of things to keep you busy. The article does state " It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China." Although the artical does state that it took some time, it was never hard to find something to do. Supporting this, "The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time." Although it would take a while, the only way to get board is not to join and I don't think anyone is in there right mind when they say "I want to be board."
