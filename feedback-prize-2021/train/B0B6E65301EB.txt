I think the Facial Action Coding System is pretty good, but I think it has a few problem.

The Mona Lisa is a hard painting, because every people have a different opinion about it. For example some people say she is sad, angry, but some people say she is happy. This Facial Action Coding System can help us. It says Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. This program can read by muscles so it can help us if we have painting and we need analys that. It has classifield six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. If we raise our eyebrows then we are surprised. This system can mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece. It says we can probably tell how our friend is feeling by the look on her/his face, but it is not always true. I think everybody had experience when she/he was smiling but she/he was sad inside. And I think this program can not read this if we are similing but we are sad inside. It says the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. It could be good if the students bored or confused but a computer never being a human. In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth and it was instruction #1. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around eyes. It was instructions #2. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Faces do not lie. The emotionals very important in our life. If our friend is sad but if we are positive and we are smiling than maybe he/she will smile.

This technology is pretty good. It has a lot of examples how it is working and it is good if we need to use this program in class. For example analysing painting. But I don not think it always could be analysing human emotionals.
