I think that is a good policy because it makes students that play sports want to have a better grade instead of just passing so they can play. Most football stars have a C

average and still get to play because there excuse is "i'm a football star if i get a scholarship it will be on football,

not on academics", but they don't understand that you can lose your scholarship if you don't have good grades. Also changing the policy would look good on the schools reputation because grades would be going up, which means our school would be respected academically as well as athletically, which means we could get grants for much needed school repairs. We might lose some key players but if they cant get a B in college they don't play so its just preparing them for that. The only bad thing is that people might move to different schools and then we would start to lose funding after enough people left, but if people saw that they were just trying to help then this wouldn't be a problem.
