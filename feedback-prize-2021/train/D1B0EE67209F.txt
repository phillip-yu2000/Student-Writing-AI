Dear principal,

I am writing this letter, to help choose which policy would be best for the school. I think that the first policy would be a better choice. Some kids have overprotective parents and they need a phone to let them know where they are or something. Also, what if on their way home something very bad happens; fall and can't get up, lost, hit by a car, robbed or many other possible things, they would need to inform their parent or guardian right away. Another reason i chose that policy is because either way kids are going to bring a phone, and because of that there would be a lot of confiscations. To avoid having parents come to school and pick up their kids phones, you should just allow kids to use their phones on free times. If every school had this policy there would be no reason to text during class since all kids would know they have free time in a couple minutes. That is why i think we should have policy 2.
