In "The Challange of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present in many different ways. The first way is, he says that Venus is much like Earth. It has a surface of rocky sediment which is much like Earth. He also says that Venus has valleys, mountains, and crates much like Earth. The secound way is that in the article the author says, "Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."

This furthermore explains how the aurthor explains his thoughts.

Venus is not hospitable for many different reasons. The first reason is that Venus is 97% carbon dioxide. The second reason is that Venus itself can reach up to 800 degress Fahrenheit. Another reason Venus is not hospitable is becuase the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system. The final reason Venus is not hospitable is that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid making it impossible to live on Venus.

Although there are many reasons why Venus is not hospitable NASA might have found a slolution. In the article it says that NASA could maybe make a "blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape." This is just like how our jets travel at a higher altitude to fly above storms. The vehicle NASA is talking about will be very similar to jets. In the article it says, "a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." Even though temperatures will still be around 170 degrees thirty miles above the surface NASA might be able to pull it off.

In conclusion, even though there are many different dangers to exploring Venus NASA won't settle for nothing.
