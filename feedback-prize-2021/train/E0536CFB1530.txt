I think the principal should go with policy 2. I guess it's okay to have them during free time or lunch periods, but eventually, it'll be their main priority. It'll probably start off okay, but when your texting someone, you tend to make the conversation longer. Let's say one of your best friends was telling you a secret about someone else. They'd text and text, and it be almost impossible to stop because you have so much you want to cover. Then they might sneak it under a table or hide it in a book as if they're reading. Well instead of listening to your teacher the whole time and not studying, you've been texting, which could affect your grades for all the time you've lost. Staying focus and putting your mind to what really matters gets you far in life, not texting.

People may use some excuses like if they're was an emergency. The school does have a phone, doesn't it? Why not use those instead. They become so obsessed with them sometimes that they become idols and we forget what's really important. If texting gets out of hand instead of working, people could fail high school, or their grades will keep them from getting into the college that they want to go to. Just save all the texting for the end of the day so that you can get done was has to get done. Procrastinating will put you in a big whole, and you'll look back and see where you messed up, maybe hoping that you had put your priorities first. By then, it'll be too late.

What's more important, cell phones or education?
