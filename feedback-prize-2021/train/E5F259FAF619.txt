I think we should be able to use are phones as long as when we are not using them when we are in class. If we are at lunch or between classes if should be okay. It would be a good idea also because so students have to talk to there parents if they have to stay after school or get sick in the day they could just text or call there parents. If your parents had to talk to there child about something that was important that had happened at home or if she could not pick you up from school.

If we are in class we should make sure they are off because we don't need then when the teacher is trying to teach. If we have them in class we might not listen to what the teacher has to say.

If they go off we might want to use them and not listen to what we have to do for homework. It might even get another kid not listening.

I think it would be a good thing to a least try. If kids were not following the rules for the phones then they could take that away for a week or two and see if they would start to follow the rules for the use of the phones. There are benefits to us being able to use our phones at school. They could call there parents about sports, sick, and getting home late. Its a good idea to have phones at school.
