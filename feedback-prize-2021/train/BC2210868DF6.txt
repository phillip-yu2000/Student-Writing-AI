I think its not fair because some people have a hard time with concentrating in certain classes.

I think it should be a D and below to not be able to play in sports or other activity's. My opinion is that I think it is unacceptable to have a below C average because i think that just means there not there for education there just at school for friends and other things that are not educated. So i think they should still be able to participate in sports or other activity's still unless once again if it's a D or below. If people that had to leave because something bad happened to them or a family member that would not be fair to them . So if my principle changed the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activity's unless they have a B average then that would not be right at all.
