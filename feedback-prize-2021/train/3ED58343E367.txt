Do you think the Face on Mars is real? The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. If there was something that made this, they would leave tracks. But there's nothing.

The Face on Mars is not real because it's a natural form. Scientist says it's a "mesa." Which is common in Mars in Cydonia. It also said that NASA said "a huge rock formation which forms a head, eyes, nose, and a mouth." So everything is made out of bunch of rocks. Michel Malin and his Orbiter snapped the picture ten time bigger than the original picture in 1998. So then it revealed a " natural landform." Theres nothing special about. It's was just land. Later on, Malin's team did a second picture but bigger in 2001. Gavin said there were other objects like shack, airplanes, pyramids, etc. They were all made natural. Also, in Earth, there are many landfroms that looks like things. Like Middle Butte in the Snake River. And it is almost the same size as the Face on Mars.

Just because it's on Mars doesn't mean it made by aliens. It's made out of natural. Sometimes strange objects appear around the Earth. Thats because it's normal to the us and enviroment. It's just a natural form. Its just the lack of conspiracy theorist.
