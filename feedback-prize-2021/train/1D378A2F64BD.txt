Autonomous cars are not the thing of the future. At this point in time, our technology can not match real life situations. There are too many conditions and too many saftey standards that are virtually impossible to accomplish while creating a "Driverless Car".

In the subtitle; Sensing the World, it explains how most of the driverless cars act and how they truely work. Many of the first productions were meant to run a specific track rigged with wires, magnets, and etc. This technology would be far too expensive, so we must rely on sensors and other features connected directly to the car. The problem with sensors, video cameras, and laser systems, is that they all can malfunction. The last thing anyone wants to do is to rely on something may indeed malfunction and put them in danger. Even if we were to say that the sensors and other technology was working in top shape, there still are limits to them such as poor lighting, bad weather conditions, and even animals.

Overall, we as human should not rely on technology to perform one of the worlds dangerous daily functions. Instead of progressing AI control, we should focus more on how the car would react if we the humans lost control. We have come this far by manual control, why switch now? Most accidents that occur on the road are drunk driving, distraction, and un safe conditions. Built in technology would be able to counter both driving under the influence and distractions.
