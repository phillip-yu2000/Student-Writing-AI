I think that the idea of having Driverless Cars is in a way not smart. For the simple fact that anything can happen while your in the car what if the car malfunctions and it hits something before it gets your attention. And a question that I have is will the car stop as it gets your attention or will it keep going? Also in the passage it says what if road blocks lie ahead of the car will it stop?

But I'm not totally against it because it seems like they have the right idea. In the passage it states that the combination of the censors that the cars will need and the laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the diverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel! But I don't think that this makes the cars driverless I look at it more as assisting. Also the process will be very expensive, for a simple radar it costed two hundred million dollars!

Also what is a driver goes to sleep on the road a simple vibration will not wake them up if anything it soothing! Alot of accidents may occur from this feature. Also they don't even have the new laws following accidents in the new Driverless cars, maybe some people will think that the new laws are unfair and that can stir up alot of problems!

Lastly I think that the drivers will get very bored having to wait on their turn to drive, and how will the car know you destination will you have to make all the turns for the car? I really just think it isn't a good Idea there are to mny flaws that come with Driverless cars!
