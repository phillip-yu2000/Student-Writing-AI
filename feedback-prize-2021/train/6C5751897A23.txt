You should join the seagoing cowboys. We have fun, travel, help people, and deliver animals.

One reason is because we travel. We have gone to China, Italy, and even Greece. We will go so many more places to maybe even England. We would be able to go to a lot more places. With you.

We also deliver animals and food. Our animals include horses and young cows. We need help caring for all of our animals. Caring for our animals means making sure they have been fed and watered every hour.

Also we help people. We give them food and animals. They need that after wars. Its such an adventure.

Just because we help people and do work doesn't mean we don't have fun. On our trips back we play table tenis, baseball and, vollyball. We also do fencing and boxing.

Thats why i think that you should join us. I hope we see you on our next trip.
