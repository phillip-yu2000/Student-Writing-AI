Dear senator of Florida

The Electoral College should not be kept in the system because. One, the electoral college are the people chosen by the candidate that are running for president and are made of House of Representatives and Senate. The electoral college votes for the president based on what the people from the state vote on. " Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." so in other words you may vote for someone but it's all upon the electors to discide who wins the election. another thing that is wrong with the electoral college is we don't was vote for our electors. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to the voters. becuse of the winner-take- all sytem in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they knjow they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind of election we have now. the people believe that we should have the power to discide who we choose as our president not the electoral college.

their is some upsides to the electoral college system. "In the winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates- as we saw in [2012's] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. . . . Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign.... the more likely to be more thoughtful voters favoring the people of the state." And in the bigger states the electoral college therew are more electoral votes due to the amount of people in the states and in this case more votes equal higher of a chance of the person you picked to become president.

yes there might be an upsid eto having an electoral college but the risks out weigh the benefits. And so in the end i believe that we shoudn't have an electoral college i believe that the people should vote for themselfs.
