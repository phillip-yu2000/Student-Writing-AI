Phones While Driving

While being in the car and having your phone on you, you are responsible to know when it is an appropriate time to use it. If you are lost and need to find a way to get home, you can easily pull up maps and navigate yourself. If you need to use the phone to make a phone call in the car you should be able to, just appropriately and safely. Although, using your phone in the car while driving is very dangerous and can lead to an accident. It is still important that you have your phone on you on all times in case of an emergency and use it accordingly to time. You shouldn't use your phone while driving instead, use it when you have stopped at a red light.

Car accidents can happen very fast and most of the causes for them is texting and driving. Texting and driving is not a safe option epically if you have others in the car with you. "Cell phones caused 26 percent of car accidents in the U.S. in 2014. Text messaging causes 5 percent of crashes" it is important that you know when to use your mobile device while on the road. You should be able to have your phone in your presence though, while driving. If something has gone wrong, you shouldn't be trapped without a phone on the side of the road, instead you should be able to use your phone in case of an emergency.

Phones can distract anyone anywhere at any time, that is why you should use it responsibly at the right time. While driving your phone should never be in your hands, instead it should be in your purse, glove department, etc, at least arms reach. A phone can distract you in and within seconds "BOOM" you hit a car, so it is important you use at an appropriate time.
