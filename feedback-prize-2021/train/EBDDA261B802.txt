I think the first policy is better because if had an a bad accident you will need your mom or dad to bring you something like inhaler or like special the nurse ran out that she had for you .They the other reason was that if you are getting bully you can call your mom up to the school and you can straighten this out with both of you guys parents if needed. But inside the class room they should be turned off inside the class room and if you get caught with a cell phone out you get in trouble by the principal and you don't get back until your mom up and straighten everything out and that mean that you cant bring it to school no more. In between lunch and free period you should to use not just to call your mom just to come get you .You should be allow to do that only three times unless you have a dentist appointment that same day or a doctors appointment. Will in lunch you should be able to call your mom and tell you fast food or some homemade food because maybe you just don't eat lunch inside of school or you just think their lunch is nasty or just look nasty.
