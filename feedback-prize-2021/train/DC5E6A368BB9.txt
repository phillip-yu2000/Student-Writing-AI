This is not a valuable thing to have in the classroom. This is not valuable because when we are on the computer we are not doing things that have anything to do with how we are feeling. When we are on the computer we are usaly writing esays, taking test, and reading articles.

Some times in the classroom we will wright esays. When we are righting esays they are usaly about books or historical people/events. These things have nothing to do with how we are feeling and when I am wrighting I never have a smile on my face even if im having a good day.

In class we will be taking test. When your taking a test its about what your thinking not how your feeling. Your not going to have a smile on your face if your thinking about the year J.F.K was shot are you?

when you are reading an article in class its rare that its funny or sad. Usaly there about politics or a historical person. You are not going to show to much emotion when reading those.

That is why I think that this would be pointless to use in a classroom. This is pointless because we dont do things that provoke emotion. We read article, take test, and wright.
