Dear principal,

I think that students should only be required to perform community service when they are needed to or when wanted to. For example: ( If they have done something wrong to the school property they would have to clean up what they have done, or the students should be required if the are willing to do this kind of job to stand up for there community.) Mostly some students would love to do community service. Just show people how much awe they can show. I think it would be best for having volunteers to show up to do this kind of utilization.

This would help community be more of a clean place to be in if students are able to do community service in a plausible way. I would think that all students should not be forced to do this, but they should be offered to do it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
