Dear principle,

I am writing you this letter because of your new policy you are considering on passing for sports. I know many people on school sports team's, i myself do not participate in school sports. I participate in out of school sports. But many friend's of mine are on the school's volleyball team, basketball, cheer leading, and football team's. I know they enjoy their sport very well, but if you make the change from having a C average to participate, to a B average most kid's will not be able to enjoy their sport anymore. All lot of us kid's have C average's.

But i believe if you make take away sports from C average people you may not have any school team's anymore. I don't think that your grade average should be able to take you off the team. I know that your probably thinking i shouldn't have a say in this since i don't play school sports. But i do play out of school sports like volleyball, tennis, bowling, and some other sports just to name a few.

I don't want to see my friend's being kicked of the team just because they had a bad day, boomed a quiz and it brought down there overall grade in the class. I can tell you one thing that i know many people who play sports that, that is all they live, breathe, and eat is sports. They practice everyday even when there not at a team practice they practice with friends and family to achieve there goal and be good in the sport that they love.

So i guess what i am trying to say is don't change the sports grade policy, after all a C average is still passing.

Thank you for taking the time to read this argument letter about the new policy that i hope you don't which to. Thanks again Mrs. Principal.
