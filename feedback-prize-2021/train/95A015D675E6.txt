Dear State Senator

My name is Mikayla and I am very concerned about how my president should be elected for the United States. It would be nice to change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States , not keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair and should not be used to elect the President of the United States.

The Electoral College has it's issues to why it shouldn't be used to elect the president of the United States. Well for one the Electoral College system "voters vote not for the president , but for a state of electors , who in turn elect the president." In paragraph 10, sentence 4 it states that electors "sometimes" get confused. Why is that you ask? well because the people are picking the wrong candidates.

The electoral college is also unfair to voters. I say this because of the winner take all system in each state. in paragraph 13 , In paragraph 2 it states that canididates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , they focus only on the tight races in the "swing" states. Personally i wouldn't want to use something like that if its unfair , outdated , and irrational.

We should change the election to popular vote for The President. Why you ask? good question. Well because that way it can be fair and reasonable. And let's not forget the voters wouldn't get confused.

The electoral college should be abolished forever. We should continue from now on by changing to election by popular vote for the president. Popular vote would be fair and everyone would love it.       Â
