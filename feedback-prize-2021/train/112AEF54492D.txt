Dear State Senator,

I believe that we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Simply because as citizens we do our parts by working our butts off daily doing things to help build the community up or even clean it up. We should be able to have some type of power over who will be leading us down the road for however many years. With a popular vote, it would not only be fair but justifiable as well. As helping and paying citizens we should be able to feel as if we have a voice in this goverment and can make, what can be a powerful change in this world.

I truly believe that if it all was based on the popular vote the world would be at piece... everyone wouldn't feel like the government or others discared their opinions and just did what they wanted. Instead, they'd feel like they got a good try out of it and was able to fight just a tad bit for what they believed to be right instead of being knocked down and told their opinions do not matter. It would also give an accurate vote. The Electoral College is minimized to 538 people being able to vote for the president and a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president giving the candidates a less of a chance to win. With the popular vote it gives them more of a chance to win the election.

We people should feel safe and secure with whom is chosen to lead us and our government. With that being said I totally agree that it should be changed election by popular vote for the president of the United States.
