Dear Principal,

I think the policy that you are considering is an out range to many athletes at your school or any schools as a matter a fact.

I think athletes like my self should at least have a 2.0 grade average because that's a C average and that should be good enough because not everybody is good at school some people aren't good at math , English , science , health , geography . so just because we cant a B in every class we cant get a B we cant participate in athletics?? That is a total out rage to all athletes and coaches because some of the best players on the team try their best in school and all the school subjects so just because they tried their best but still cant pull off a B they cant play that's not right.

Another reason why u shouldn't consider this new policy is because if you want your school to win a championship and get cool stuff for your school then you have to realize that the best players on the teams sometimes cant pull of a B in every class. And every team needs their best players to come up and play because without them no hard feelings but the teams might suck including your team. And playing without your best player is ruff trust me.

Im one of the captains of my basketball team and the best i can pull off in class is a C and trust me i do try to do my best sometimes the great basketball players arent good at school but im positive when i speak for the basketball players on every team that if one team member goes down others show up and play harder but that's sometimes not enough but like my coach says all for one and one for all.

So please don't consider this policy for your school because it'll just be a total outrage and chaos will happen with your basketball team.
