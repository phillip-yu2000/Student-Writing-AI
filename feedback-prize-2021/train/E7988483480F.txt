Dear Principle,

I do not think the idea of students who don't have a B average not being able to play sports is fair.

Some students don't do well because of a certain problem or disability that they have.

Also, many kids are overweight or have nothing to do in the afternoons when they get home from school and most kids' parents' work in the afternoons so sports are usually a really good extra curricular activity to have to keep them busy.

Also when colleges are looking at student's applications they look for extra curricular activities along with good grades. If a student makes very good grades and also does sports and other activities then the college would most likely choose them instead of a student whose grades are not good and that student doesn't have any sports or activities. Taking away sport opportunities for students with lower grades would lower the amount of students going to college and being successful in life.

Thank you for your time,
