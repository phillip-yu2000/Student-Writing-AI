In the artical they are talking about how they came out with this new prgram. In this program it is able to read people facial feature by there actions they were able to get the Mona Lisa's in the artical they said that she was more happy then mad she was sad and angry or other things. I agree with this to have a machine that will tell your emotion this wouldnt just be helpful for students it would also be helpful for stuednts because if they have something wrong and they dont know what is they can just go to the machine they could just get there face examed and then they would have resluts. it would help counlsers alot to because not everyone can tell when someone is either mad or upset. Also it wouldn't just be helpful for schools it'd be helpful for police station so when they are questioning they can ditect if they are lying or not another thing is it wouldn't just be a small accomplishment to move on into the future life it'd be a goal for them to have multiple if these computures in places where they will need them at and places where others will use them for good. A bad thing about this computer would be for teachers if they were to upload a lesson to it and they were to have everything planned out they would either have to try to keep students on the same track as others and others for them to no get lost or confused with what they will be learning during there leasons when it detects on of them being bored. After all the reading i did think it'd be a good idea because it wouldn't just help one person it wouldnt help multible people who need counsling or for people who don't know how to feel or what to say. So this computer wouldn't just make an impact in one person but maybe world wide.
