Dear Principal,

I would like to share my views on the new possible policy change requiring students to have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I am partly against this policy change and partly for the change. The part of me for the policy to be changed can understand why you are doing this. I am going to assume it is because you want the students to do better in school by motivating them with higher requirements for there sports or other various school activities.

The other side of me that is saying not to go through with this policy change. The reason for me being against it is that I enjoy the activities sponsored by the school and I don't want to have to change myself academically to participate in these activities. The students who do not have the required B average would also not like this possibility. As I stated earlier, I do understand why this could be good thing motivating the students. But, it also has a chance to have a bad effect on the students education. If the students are so into their activities that they care more about said activities than their education they could be effected by the previously stated bad change. That bad change is the students dropping out. And I know that you, the principal and head of the school, do not want your students dropping out of school and ruining their education.

In conclusion, I agree with this about 50% and disagree about 50% with this double-edged sword of a policy change. The good side being motivating the students and the bad side being students dropping out of school. Thank you for your time reading this letter.

Your student,
