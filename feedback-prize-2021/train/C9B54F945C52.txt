Everyone has heard of the Face found on the Red Planet from a region called Cydonia, right? It was pretty interesting and a very amazing thing. It became a pop icon and starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows. Everyone believed this was evidence for life on Mars. But that was shut down after another picture was taken of the Face that didn't quite look like a face at all.

On April 5, 1998 Michael Maling and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a trip to Cydonia for the first time. There, they were able to snap a more clear and sharper picture of the Face than the original photos. After looking at it, the picture didn't show a face. It just showed a natural landform.

Although, the picture was proof that it was just a normal landform, not everyone was satisified. The Face on Mars is found at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet and the camera used to take the photo had to peer through the clouds to view the Face. Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the haze of the clouds.

The mission controllers were prepared for a second look. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless day in Cydonia, the Mars Global Surveyor went to find the Face. What the picture showed was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which are landforms common in the American West.

In conclusion, the Face was not made by aliens. The Face has nothing to do with aliens and wasn't made or created by them. The Face isn't The sharper pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 show proof that the Face is actually just a natural landform.
