Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard from some of my friends that you wish to change school policy so that all students hoping to participate in a sport must have a B or above as there average. Even though that may bring up a few student averages I must disagree with your point. Here's why...

Firstly, I would like to point out the students that are week in core classes like Math and English and need to use sports as a gateway to there future such as college or maybe even getting a job. These students will have more trouble in their future if they don't have something there good at and can excel in such as sports.

Secondly, what will happen to the students who give up after hearing they must maintain a B to be in sports? Some students have to try hard to maintain a C. What would happen to them? A lot of them will most likely stop trying altogether now that they've lost motivation.

My final point is that I think the current policy work fine. While I disagree that students must have a B average, I think maintaining a C is nothing short of reasonable. Student who are getting failing grades are obviously not trying and there isn't really any excuse for that.

Keeping a C average is a just and understandable policy.

Inclusion I would like to thank you for your time and hope you bear in mind the points I've made in my article.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
