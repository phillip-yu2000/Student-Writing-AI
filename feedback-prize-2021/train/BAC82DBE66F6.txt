The government claims they are for the people. In which the electoral colledge is cerrupt considering that every state doesent have the same amount of votes. Even thoe a presedent can get majority vote it wont matter because the other presedent has more votes according to the electoral colledge. Your not even voting for the presedent your voting for,a state of electors then they elect the presedent, how do you know that they are going to vote for your spacific presedent. This shows that a simple system can be rigged for failure.

Sorce 2 paragraph 11 shoes that certain electors refused to vote for there partys presedent. Popular vote is a simpler less fool proof system and should be considered if the government is trully for the people. The electoral colledge it is a very sensitive system and alot can go rong vary easyly,knowing that your vote might not actually matter can be frusturating because your relying on a nother person to vote for that presedent. We the people should change the system from electoral colledge to popular vote its only fair to the citizens that actually vote, and its more fool proof.

Sure they say that curruption happens vary rarly in this system but you cant simply trust somebodys word like that expessualy now in days. Its scary how you have to vote for a state to vote for you chosen presedent its just a longer more complicated system that can get messed up easyly. Election for the presedent is a big deal our presedent has the biggest role in the country and if we cant rely on electoral colledge because it can easyly be currupt or damaged than that could screw the whole country over.

I think we should change to popular vote because it stands more for the people and is more fool proof and can work better for a number of reasons. I hope the state senitor wold be able to take this idea in and make it work.
