I believe our school should let us students have cell phones at school. Many teachers may say," No, students will use them during class and that it's just an interruption", but some students may need their cell phones after school if there in sports or in any kind of activity, they may not even have to be in a sport at all.

Yes, it is true some students won't turn off their phone in class, but there's always a punishment for that. Students should be able to use them during lunch hours or even passing periods. Yea staff may say," No they're going to be calling people to do something dumb or may even call parents to pick them up." But some may just have a smart phone and may just play games and not even interrupt other people. Yea what if kids don't have a smart phone? That doesn't mean they cant have one at school. Teachers also say," NO PHONES in the locker room", Because some students act immature and start taking pictures of other people or send forwards about a person, wich can hurt someone in many ways. Some students may even use them in class or in the library, but there is a always a consequence for that persons actions. Some students may get caught and some may not but when they do the teacher or teachers should have all the power to look at the students history on their phone to see if they have been messaging other students in other class. This cause is very disruptive especially if the cell phone isn't on vibrate or silent. Kids can always be in need of help after school that's why they would need their phone, and if they didn't have their phones something bad can happend because nobody knows when something bad is going to happened.
