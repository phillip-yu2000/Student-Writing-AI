Students at most schools love to play sports. If they have to have a B average grade, that will be unfair. Most schools need to have a grade over an F or u can't play sports. The more students you have at your school that like to play sports, the better. When most of the student like to play Basketball, they participate more in playing that sport. When they participate more, they win more games at different schools and your school, the more games they win, the more trophies they bring back to the school, the more trophies they bring back, the more popular your school will be. When many of the students have a C average and they need a B average, there will be hardly any students playing the sports that they love at the school. I don't think you should change the policy to kids needing a B average grade because you won't have very many students participating in your school's sports activities. Changing the policy to needing to have a B average to play sports would be un-called for. Your school won't have any teams at all.
