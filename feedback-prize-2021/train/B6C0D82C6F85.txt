To the principal:

I believe that all students should not be required to perform in community service. Some of the students just have too much on there plate already,

then throw in something else, it will cause much drama that the school does not need. Even though community service is a great way to help out and fix things in your community it will just take up way to much time your students lives. The downside to not having every student involved in community is that colleges look at the student and their extra activities they are involved in outside of school. I know that would help some students that are going to college on a academic and sports scholarship but yet again it would have seen a waste to some of the students that are planning on not attending college. This year if i would have been forced to do community service it would have been a hassle for me since i play football and i am in double advance classes that takes up most of our evenings and sometimes even our weekends. Overall community service should not be required to all students maybe the ones who do not have anything to do after school or on the weekends that would be great but those who play a sport or are in a group, club or something like that it would not suit them well. All though community service is a very debated topic around the schools in our nation. It is as big as the board of education. So in the next few years we might see a law passed from the president concerning community service involvement in schools.
