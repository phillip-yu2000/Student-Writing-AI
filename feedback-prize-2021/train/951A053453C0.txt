Having different technology helps people. People like it, it can be helpful in many different ways. For example, if a person can't speak their is a techonolgy that helps people that don't have to have a voice with a computer. Techonolgy is useful in many different ways. The use of the technology in the article Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D' Alto would be really vaulable.

The new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad says the author. Examples that they use when a computer can tell if you are happy or sad is if you smile when a web ad apperas on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But, if you frown, the next ad will be different. That would be great because if you are watching something and then all of a sudden an ad comes on and you can't skip it, you want it to be entertaining and fun and not boring and dumb. It would also be very helpful if you are at school. "A classom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", Dr. Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lessson, like an effective human instructor" that would be really helpful for some people. Just, in case somone dosen't want to speak up if they are confused the commputer will know right away.

There's also other examples for this. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for the videogames which would become more fun for the person playing the videogame or video surgery. Dr. Huang also says "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that, too."

I would think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable. By, the way it works and the way it could help in many different ways. In this passage it wants us to understand that a new technology could be coming soon, in which it could help in many different ways.
