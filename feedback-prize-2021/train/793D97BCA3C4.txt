Dear Principle

I believe policy 1 is the best choice for our school for many different reasons. One reason I believe that police 1 is best is because student won't get suspended every other day for the usage of the phone. So instead of students being suspend they can be at school learning, and not missing any work or assignments. Which means they wont be behind everyone else. Another reason I believe you should enforce this police is because students will be able to contact someone if they have a problem and can't get to any one at that time. Any example: if a student is hurt, like the student has broke their leg, they can just pull out their cell phone and call someone to come and help them. There are some reason I believe you should enforce this policy. I know your thinking what if the students pull out their cell phone during class. Well here are some ways to make sure the phones are turned off during class. One thing you can do is have all student, when they walk into class drop their phones into a little box. Another thing you can do is have the teachers check the phones and make sure that their turned off.
