In my opinion I think it will be a good idea for the teachers to know if a student is in a good mood or not. When a teacher calls on a student and dont not want to go the teacher might think it is because that child is being rude, and all that the child want is to be left alone.

With the scaning programs, that could scan your face and can tell if you are in a good mood or not, teachers and student could have a good bond. If the teacher scans a kid face in morning when they all enter class she could know who to call on ,or maybe even after class she could even have a talk with the child. If someone can tell how a person feel if it's fear , anger ,digust, happiness,and surprise.

Those are some examples of ways it will be useful to have the "Facial Action Coding System". That type of technolgy would be very valuable in the classroom,and maybe even outside of school.
