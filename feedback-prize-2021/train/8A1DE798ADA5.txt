I do not agree with this statement, one reason is what if a student cant do certain activity. Activity's arent always good for certain people they might need help on something or they feel sick, you cant always put school in frontÂ of everything. Activity's are great but you gotta make sure you are in the right state to do said activity.

School activities are a great way to socialize but its also bad if a student gets too anxious or cant handle said activity you cant make the student do an activity. School isnt for activity's either its meant for learning about socializing, and learning something new, and activity's might get in the way of studying or trying to remember certain things. Its very important to make sure your students are well kept and helped and that there not worked up.

Anxiety is a huge plus with school, there is many things to do and learn and adding to it might get a student worked up and its very important to keep a student feeling safe and knowing that there is help. I dont think its bad but i also say it isn't good there are pro's and con's to it and it depends on the student in general. You cant just focus on the student though you also have to worry about the parent and see what they say because there parent is the one that is giving the student the opportunity to do activities and if they dont like the idea maybe cast a vote.

All in all my opinion about making students do activities is a no for me there are good things about it but there is also bad things and making sure everyone is updated with the idea is a big step. Voting might help since it lets parents know and also gives them a choice but it also helps the student with there school academics.
