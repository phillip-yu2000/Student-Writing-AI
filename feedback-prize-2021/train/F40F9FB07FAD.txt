"Driverless Cars Are Coming"

Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore ? They started coming up with new ideas on how to make cars work better. Most people like me are fascinated with cars that can drive themselves . Who wouldn't want a car that could do that?

It sounds like a good idea but there are some things most people wouldn't like about these cars. The cars that already have been created are not completely driverless. That means you still have to pay full attention when the car is working by itself.

Google had a car that could drive half a million miles without crashing but it still wasn't driverless . The driver gets notified when pulling in and out of driveways. The Google cars would also alert the driver incase of a accident or roadwork .

Some of the cars made had sensors in them. The sensors would allow a much better respond than the human drivers . BMW "Traffic Jam Assistant" had a sensor that would make sure the driver had hold of the wheel. Most of the cars developed so far couldn't really do much but steer,accelerate, and brake themselves. The human driver still had to remain alert incase they had to take over and start driving in case of an accident or roadwork ahead .

So why would anyone want a driveless car that still needs a driver? They think the idea of it is fun , which it is . Most laws about driving are focused on keeping the people in the vehicle safe. New laws will be made incase there is an accident . They will have to see whos fault is it- the driver or the manufacturer .

Would you still want a car that you had to drive? Doesn't really sound like a good idea to me . Sounds fun but it's a lot of work .
