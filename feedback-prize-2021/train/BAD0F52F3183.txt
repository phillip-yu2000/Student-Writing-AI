The Face, is it a natural landform or actual life on the planet Mars? In this argument I believe that the Face on the planet Mars is not alien life, but is a natural landform that has formed over periods of time.

I believe that the Face is a natural landform because of the information from the text.

Starting of on May 24, 2001 when the Viking 1 space craft found the face when it was searching for an area for its sister Viking 2 to land.

In 1976, the Face was not that clear at the time until 1998 when it started to take more shape.

I believe that if it was not a natural landform, NASA would have probably kept quite about it until they offically knew that it was or was not a natural landform.

Just because when it came, people are statring to think that the Face is "bone fide evidence of life on Mars."

If there was life on Mars, people all around the world would know about the it, and possibly would try to travel to Mars to see such life forms.

Yet know has tried, we humans have only sent robots to do the work on Mars for us.

On April 8, 2001 when they took the picture the second time, they have recievced a photo that they could compare to the picture that the Viking 1 took in 1976.

I believe that it is just a landform because the qoute from Garvin when he said "It reminds me nost of Middle Butte in thr Snake River Plin of Idaho" so it must just be a landform creation when it can remind some on of an experience the already seen.

In closing, from the facts from the story I believe that the Face is not alien life, but it is a natural landform that has been created over time.
