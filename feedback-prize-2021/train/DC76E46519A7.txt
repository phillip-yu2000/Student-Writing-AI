Phones & Driving

Well to begin with, I think drivers should not be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I think drivers shouldn't use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it's very dangerous. Texting and driving or even looking at something on your phone while driving can be very risky for you.

Personally i wouldn't text and drive. When driving you have to be very cautious. Cautious for you , not only you but other too. First off texting and driving is illegal. If you get caught by the police you can get a ticket for it or worse. Majority of the people today don't care. They would rather text back immediately when it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car.

I know for a fact it's dangerous because just a month ago my cousin and 6 of my friends got in a bad accident. The accident was so tragic that my cousin and 4 other friends died and only one of them manage to get out. The driver that hit their truck was drunk. Not only was he drunk but he was texting as well. When driving you should never text. If you think the message is that important you should at least go park your car and go from their.

They have commercials on tv about texting and driving. Also on billboards, youtube, and etc. A lot of people text and drive still to this day. But it's most definitely not safe. I think banning cellphones while driving would be a good thing to do. Everyday people die from car accidents. Because of the use of using their cell phones while driving.

We've all became attached to our cell phones. However there is a dangerous side to cell phones. That is using it while driving. It is very dangerous. Also it can cause of harm to yourself, not only yourself but others as well. When you are driving you have to be cautions and know that your driving for others too;
