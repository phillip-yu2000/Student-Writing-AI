dear principal it think that it is not fair the way that you are not letting all of us students not participate in all the sports here in SCHOOL_NAME only if you have b average you may play .please if you let us play the sports without a b average not all of us are perfect at what we are. plus if you don't let other kids play sports without a b average it will be total chaos if you don't let us students will not try there best to put in effort in to there grade .there fore if you do decide to let other children with different grade average they may pick up there grade if you allow them to play there sports

. there personality may change and start acting right and then all of the kids would have a b average and you'll be so proud of your school and how much effort the put into there school work and the way they act who knows they might even mature . in conclusion that is why i think that you may want to rethink about the rule on sports that you want to pass I hope you don't want to pass this new policy because your doing something that the children of SCHOOL_NAME would not appreciate because sports are a big part of SCHOOL_NAME and for you just to make a decision like that is hurtful to the kids who play sports here in SCHOOL_NAME
