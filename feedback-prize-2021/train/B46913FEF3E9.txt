Dear principle,

I have heard that you want to make all students do community service. Well I do think that some of them are not wanting you to do that but me i do. In this letter i am going to give you some examples why you should make ever student do community service.

Well one is that some people need to take time out of there day to help there community. I think it will be a big help for the students to learn responsibility. It will also help the community to be clean and not have trash all over the place.

Here are some suggestions on some community service idea. cleaning up trash on the streets, helping out at the retirement home, and also helping out at the animal shelter. There are some examples on some that people do everyday. Me myself loves animals and would like to help out at the animal shelter.

Also it helps the student to take care of thing that he/she has. He/she will learn to not to throw out trash on the street because they will know what its like having to pick up trash on the side of the road. It will teach them to take care of there pets. Last but not least it will teach them to be kind to there elders and to take care of them, love them. It will teach them to take care of there elders at there house, there church, or at school.

Well this is my letter on why you should make students do community service.

Sincerely: A fellow student
