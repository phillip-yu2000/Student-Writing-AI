Dear SCHOOL_NAME Principal

I don't think that students should be required to take community service because it would just take time out of their school work.

Also Students might have to do things when they get home like babysit their sister or brother but if students are required to do community service then their parents might be late to work. Another example is that students might fail a test/quiz because they don't have enough time to study do to the community service.

Therefore it would the service would make the kids more tired and would not pay attention to what the teacher is explaining.

Also students have sports after school and if they are late then the coach might not play them in games and or events.

Another example is that students might only see their parents a half an hour before they go to work but with the community service the students would not see their parents at all.

Those are some reasons that the students at SCHOOL_NAME should not have to do community service.

But in some cases it would be a good thing because it would keep our planet cleaner and there wouldn't be as much pollution then there is now.

Also it would help if we clean up the earth because the rate a global warming would be decreasing.
