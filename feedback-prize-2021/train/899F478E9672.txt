NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circiling Mars and snapping photos of possible laninding sites. It spotted what looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. There are many conspiracy theorists that think this is proof of life on Mars. I disagree. The article states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West." The face like shadows that were captured on Mars can be compared to landforms on Earth. I think that what is thought to be a face, is just a hill-type mass with shadows that look like a face at certian angles. The article also says, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeares on JLP web site, revealing . . . a nautural landform. There was no alien monument after all." So what this means is that the landform has nothing to with life on Mars, just the planet itself. When NASA released the picture, they captioned it, "huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." I personally think that what they had captioned the photo is all you need to know about what it is, a huge rock foundation. If what NASA captured was an actual aliens face, they claim they would release that information because it would do so much good for them. With scientists who studied the pictures, the declaired it was only a landmass. So without the evidence of other life on Mars, that's all anyone can call it for now.
