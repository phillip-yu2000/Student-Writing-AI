Driverless cars are in our near future, but is this the best way? There are many reasons why I dont believe so, such as the fact that they are going to need to make logical decisions and could be dangerous to drivers and pedestrians due to the drivers not needed to pay as much attention to driving.

What does it mean for a computer to make a logical decision? Lets imagine that your in a driverless car, and your headed towards an inevidable crash that will kill you. The only way to get out of it is to go on the sidewalk, where 3 small children are playing hop-scotch. If your watching "in-car entertainment" and the computer decides that you need to take over at this time, there is no time for us as humans to think. This is a major problem that will come up. Unless everyone's cars are fully driverless, its hard to prevent this scenario. This would mean we would have to make traditional cars as we know it, illegal.

Fully driverless cars are coming, but there are a lot of problems that we need to address before that happens. The idea of logical decision making for a computer processing things in 1's and 0's is a hard conundrum to overtake. Once we address whether or not the government keeps or takes away our driving privledes, then we can garauntee that our roads will be fully safe.
