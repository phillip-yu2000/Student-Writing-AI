Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I have read and understood that you are considering to two policies for cell phone usage in your school. I have read both and i think that the best policy is that you allow the students to have their phones during lunch and other free times. I think this is best because giving students the time to have their phones out when there is free time gives them the time that they need to have their own personal time. When students are having to hide their phone in class this just makes more interruptions for the teacher to have to handle, but if they had their phone out in free time then there would be less interruptions for the teacher and the students wouldn't have to worry so much for getting caught with it or having to hide it. I think that giving these students the chance to have a little bit more freedom and not having to hide everything that they do would make the classroom more comfortable for the students and the teacher as well. Teachers make students feel like children when the students are getting yelled at for having phones and it just makes the whole class become uncomfortable to them. When the students have a feeling to hide something such as a cell phone, they become self aware and make things very uncomfortable for the whole class. Letting students have their phone would give them the freedom to talk with the people they wanted to without interruptions and there would be more peace and not so much tension throughout the school. When the students are hiding their phones behind books or papers they are more likely to get caught and get in trouble with not only the school but the parents as well. Letting them have their phones during acceptable times would let them have the freedom to talk but it would still make the classroom a better place in whole by teaching them but still letting them have their own personal time.

Thank you for your time,
