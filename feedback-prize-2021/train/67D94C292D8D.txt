I think that the technolgy to read students' emotional expressions would be very valuable in a class room , because like the first sentence in the passage said "Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling , even when they are trying to hide their emotions." You never know how anybody is feeling, especially if they are good at holding their face expressions.

The technology really shows which muscles move and the emotions that follows on from that facial expression. And it shows that if you have it in your classroom , at times you can look and see how your students are feeling during class. The passage says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."

I think it would be a nice thing to be able to use the technology for that because you always wanna know how somebody is feeling, you can make their day by doing something little. And people that are like hard body never want to show how they are feeling. They don't want to bring attention to their selves.
