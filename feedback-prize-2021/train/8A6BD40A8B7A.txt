I believe that you should not do that, because some people are struggling just to get a "C" and making it to an "B" that would be harder. Some kids would drop out of school if they fail another grade believe it or not it will hurt them in the long run some will lose their confidence in them selves, others would feel alone. Now, say that you are in there shoes would you like that to happen to you i don't think so,

as you can see I failed the first grade i hated that and i lost my confidence in my self i felt like i cant do nothing about it I even felt alone so as a student of SCHOOL_NAME i know what its like to struggle through school i still do right now I have low grades but

I am still going to fight for what i want. You should know yes there are some kids who don't even try those are the kid who should be sent to summer school if they don't pass but other come on give them a chance to prove to you that they are trying it's just the mertiaral is difficult to understand i know you probably think i' me saying this for me but I am not i believe i speaking for every one who struggles in school we all do we just need to learn to pick our selves back up it's easer said then done. this is my argument so make sure you listen to everyone and trust your self sencearly, STUDENT_NAME
