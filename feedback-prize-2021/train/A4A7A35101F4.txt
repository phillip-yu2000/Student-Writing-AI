To The Editor:

Many people think that cleaning trash is very helpful and many people think it wastes time. I believe that the students should choose whether or not if they would like to clean trash or spend their time doing what they want to do. Some students might not clean litter but those students may be doing something else for the community. Furthermore, it should not take many people to clean much trash. Students may also be cleaning trash on their own time as well.

People who tutor the elementary school kids, that is very nice, but some students also think it wastes time. Let those students choose to tutor or not. Some students may have important activities to do and cannot afford to waste that time. For example, some students have a sport team to go play with or practice. Others may have after school classes to attend to. Many students can help trash but there are many who cannot afford to do those stuff. The principal should not make all students require to help perform community service.

Students who do other community service might have a lot of free time, but there are those who have little time to spend. There are those who might have a part time job, or helping a friend, or they have to do a lot of homework as well. These students have a lot to do so they cannot spend their time on community service.
