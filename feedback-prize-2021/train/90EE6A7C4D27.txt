Somethings that I have observed is that when taking long trips by ground vehicles often times the driver will get tired of driving so they put their vehicle in cruise mode, now that is a nice aspect to the vehicle. Taking it one step further so that the vehicle can steer, accelerate, brake themsleves, and alert the driver to take over when nearby problems occur such as navigating through work zones and around accidents now that is even cooler. Like the article says the system has a warning system so that the seat vibrates or a light on the windshield flashes to warn of problems that are nearby. Now that sounds great but there should be even more safety like the article says installing a camera so that the vehicle is watching the driver while the driver watches the road. I am all for the driverless vehicle but some factors are necessary to take in terms of safety.

The vehicle may have a warning system which is great, but what if the warning system fails to warn. I get that there are complications that can occur such as the driver less system failing to work properly. When accidents do happen like this whose to blame is it the driver or the manufacturer. If say a mother has her children with her and the system fails and crashes does the driver have the ability to sue the manufacturer. Now if something like this does happen and it goes out to the public how many people are going to purchase the vehicle.

Like I said before I am for the driver less car, it sounds great, but people need to take in to consideration about safety. I have given my two cents about the driver less car it is time to make it work.
