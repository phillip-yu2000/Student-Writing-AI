I feel like making a multiple choices can help a person make better choices because it can do more by going to multiple choices than by sticking to one seeking multiple choices is good cause you could get different answers from different point of view. Just sticking to one is less effected because you didnt go out and find more. Cause someone might see your scenario differently. They might have experiences with Ur situations.

Chosening multiple choices can give you more options and things to chose from. Cause what if you make a choice and you dont know if you should stick with that one. then go find more answers and see which ones best for you. After you can play around with you options and see whats better than others.

You can have different things to try out you wont have to be stuck up. Thinking on one thing you can go to multiple people and ask, ask for there opinion and see what they think then take theyre advice. Because being stuck up on one wont help, you can just go out and test the waters my conclusion is. Seeking multiple choices will help so you dont go out and do something when you could ve done something better.

My thesis is talk to people and see what they think, get theyre opinion ask family,friends and even co workers ask anyone you comfterbul
