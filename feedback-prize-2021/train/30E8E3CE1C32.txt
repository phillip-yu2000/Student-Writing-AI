Dear Principle,

You are considering two policy's about having cell phones at school. The first, is to not let the students have cell phones at school. Second, to let the kids have them at school, but to not let them be on during class time. I strongly believe that you should let us have our cell phones at school ,and just have them off during class time.

I think that we should be allowed to have our cell phones at school, but not have them on during class. This is because, sometimes things happen outside of school that students need to know.

For example, say that someone's parent had to let the student know that they wouldn't be home when they said they would. The student would be able to check their phone during lunch and find out what they needed to know. Plus, kids have cell phones for a reason, and if we have our phones with us at school we will be able to contact people during the designated times about various things.

I don't think that you should make a rule that the students shouldn't be able to bring their phones to school for many reasons. I, for one, believe that children can be responsible if there are known consequences. If you are debating to not have phones at school because they might be texting, or using their phones to cheat during class then make a strict rule for it. You could say, that if a teacher finds you using your phone in class then there will be no warning it will just be taken away. If kids know that there will be a consequence then they will usually not break the rules.

Therefore, if you don't want kids to be fooling around on their phones during school then you can make sure that doesn't happen, but don't take away the student's rights to be able to contact people as, and when, they need. I strongly believe that students have the right to have their phones at school, if, and only if, they follow the rules and not abuse their privileges.

Sincerely,
