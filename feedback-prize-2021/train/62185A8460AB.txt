Phones and driving,The main meaning behind a phone is to have communication that's why it was created now the question is should we or should we not use our phones during driving. We need our phones for one thing and that's calling,Anything else other than calling could may or may not result in a crash or even death. Phones today are mostly used with teenager behind the wheel and there has been many accidents of teenagers using their phones while driving. Phones theses days cause many distractions while driving but that is their choice to pull out their phone while driving. So in my opinion i think we should have our phones while driving,so now let me explain why.

Phones,Now a days we use phones for many other things other than calling. Our phones has been changing and still changing and adding more options other than communication such as apps. Apps are mobile applications that you can download on your phone. There are just so many things that we can do on our phones,we may wanna take a picture while we on the road or we may wanna watch a movie on our phone but like i said before we need our phones for many reasons and i'm not just speaking teenagers i'm speaking for everybody because now a days we live and run on our phones so only thing i can really say about texting or anything

That has to do with a phone in driving is stay safe.

Conclusion,in my opinion everyone doesn't need to have a phone while driving but no one is going to make a law saying we shouldn't have a phone while driving. It's just not gonna happen because it would not be a suitable law to create when everyone around the whole world has phones and use them while driving. We the people are just gonna have to be more careful when behind the wheel while driving.
