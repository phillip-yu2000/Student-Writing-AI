Dear Principal,

To have to be able to have a B average to play or participate in sports is not fair in my opinion. Some people love to play sports and enjoy the opportunity to participate in these events. I would have to argue to the fact at least the students should have to receive a C to participate in these sport events because some people try there hard to the best of there ability to be able to get good grades to be able to play the sport that they want.

I have an experience of mine on that I have had a C and tried my hardest to get it up. Sometimes I even stayed after school to get the grade that I needed up. I love the sport that I play and would be extremely upset if I could not participate in the sport I wanted to play. I

would personally from experience be very upset. I would hate to see other people not be able to do the sports they wanted to . I also think the school without sports or fun activities would be a boring school because there would be no excitement for the game after school. There would be nothing to look forward to. There would be no talking in classes and the teachers would actually have silence. The teachers would maybe be happy but then be sad cause the students are upset.

That is my opinion on why we should at least have a C because a C is still a passing grade. There should still be sport activities in the school because it makes everyone happy and gives them something to look forward to throughout the week or even on weekends. They also give a lot of confidence in the world to me because you cheer on your friends to do a good job. It is a fun advantage in school and I think we should not change it and keep it the way that it is way.
