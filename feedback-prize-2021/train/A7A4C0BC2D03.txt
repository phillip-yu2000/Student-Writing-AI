dear mr. principle i don't like the new policy to have to make a b average to play sports a c is still passing so you need to let it roll by. If the policy is passed u will not have no football team because the whole team is making a c except one person and he sit on the bench.

U could have a school vote some people cant make a c but they will have to make higher den a c to go to college but right now is to much pressure then they will try to make a and bs . If you don't pass the policy it would be a great thing because everybody that want to play sports hate it and some people that like our sports team and are real fans hate it too and you will wined up with no students and the school will be shut down forever.

Let the parents vote to to see what they think and the school border because its their school they should have a word to it. a If someone making a b and they usually making honor roll and they mess up on a project and they make a c in the class they wouldn't be able to join a beta club or student council and that will be wrong but if we make a c and we cant play sports then if they make c and cant join beta club jrotc or student council because you got to treat everyone the same black ,

white , dumb,

smart,

nice , ,mean every one should be respected.

Some colleges you can go to with a c average but im staying in state so that's

5,000 dollars paid already to go there so please don't make that policy but ima try to get honor roll any way.
