Dear Principal

I think you should not make the school policy. Kids would not be playing sports if you do that so the school has no trophies for the school. You should leave the sports and activity's. The students would try harder and maybe even not sleep and the students would fall a sleep in class.

That is why should not make that policy at your school. Also they would not try anything to play sports because if you make that policy kids will not try harder. Teachers would not like there students falling a sleep in class and them getting detention for trying harder. Students would hate the principal if they are not allowed to play sports and other activity's with a grade c average.

Most kids would be tiered of lack of sleep so kids would not be happy about this situation. Policy are not fair because they make follow the policy's that schools make and the government that make new unfair policy's.

Sincerely

A Student
