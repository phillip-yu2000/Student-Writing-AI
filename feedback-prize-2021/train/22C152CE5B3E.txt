The study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becuase the temperature of Venuse is way to dangerous for humans, but it's survivable. Humans will challenge themselves to go on adventures and try to find different ways to go on planets.

Therefore this means that humans could survive Venus. Paragraph 4 states, "At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but still survivable for humans." Althought this means that Venus temperature is a potential threat towards humans, but we can survive being there. Paragraph 3 states, "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface." Things like those won't stop humnas curiosity towards finding better and more safe ways to exploring Venus.

Therefore there could be a chance we as humans can survive Venus. With the quotes and evidence that have been stated there is a possible chance for humans to go to Venus. There are many dangerous things in Venus, but it's not stoping humans curiosity toward going to Venus. This means that humans can discover new things on Venus.
