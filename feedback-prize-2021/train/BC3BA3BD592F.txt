Dear TEACHER_NAME:

Many of my friends help out the community by cleaning or doing something to help the community stay clean. I think it would be great if we helped the community stay clean. We only have four kids in our class, I think we could all be in a group and make the community a safe and clean place. Off course we would need your help to have that done.

We can help the community in many different ways. By cleaning,

giving charity, and by making our community a safe place. It would be fun for the whole class, we could have more time to talk and know each other better. If we and other students in this school help the community at least for a couple of hours a day, it will make our community a very good place.

If you can organize all this for us I'm sure no one would say no. I'm sure they will realize that we are not doing this just for us we are doing it for the whole community. Many kids stay home thinking of what to do, but if they would have a choice of staying home and not doing anything I'm sure they would love to help the community. I'm one of those students who some days has nothing to do at home and cant figure out what to do. Helping the community will help me and so many different ways. Please have the sincerity to make this community a better place by us cleaning and doing everything we can.

Sincerely your favorite student in the 8A class.
