Have you ever had to ask for advice from someone? Asking for advice from someone can sometimes be the best thing you could have done. Because maybe if you didnt ask for some advice you could have messed up or if you were planing something for someone you could have done the wrong thing if you didnt ask for advice. For example your throwing a surprise birthday party for a friend but you dont know what they want for their birthday so you can go ask one of their really close friends so you can get some advice on what they like.

One of the most common place people ask for advice is the store because the person wants to know your advice on something they dont know about. If someone ask you for advice on what brand cereal is the best you might recommend the ones you think are the best. But if there going with something healthier like what kind of fruit is the best for you you can tell them what you think is the healthiest for you. Giving advice to someone involves having an opinion on something like what your favorite ting to do outside is or what you like do do on your free time because when someone is asking for advice they want your opinion on the situation.

Getting more than one person to help you on advice is a very helpful thing to do because they can fill you in on what they think about the topic. Some people you can ask are your close friends,family,and a therapist if your having some questions. Some times you dont have to ask for someones advice but its best if you do because they can give you their input on it and you might change your mind.
