Driverless Cars Should be developed . Its a great way to save money because there is no need to buy a car or to waist money on fuel. In fact Goodle has has cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009, this has really helped promote the idea about driverless cars.

There are many perks that driverless cars pertain, for example it has driven for more than a half million miles without problems reported. Also if a person wants to take control they have to oppurtunity to do so. They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in or out driveways.

In conclusion I agree about the fact that Driverless cars should prohibited because it saves money and you can still take control. To insure safety Manufactures are also using cameras to watch the dric=vers are remaining focused non the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver .This is my reasoning of why I think "Driverless Cars"should be developed. .
