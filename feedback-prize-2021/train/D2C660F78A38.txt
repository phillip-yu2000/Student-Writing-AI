The face that you see on mars was not something created by aliens. Although it may look like a face its not. What you see in this picture is a butte or a mesa. In the following paragraphs I will state reasons helping you undertstand that the pictures effect everything and that it wasnt created by aliens.

The pictures that you have seen are very old. Most of the pictures you have seen where taken from 1976-2001. These pictures have really bad graphics. Things that are old are usaually harder to understand and comperhend. Its hard to see old things clear. Advances in technology have helped us see older things a lot more clear. We can fully understand things from the past now.

The cameras we use today have a lot better grapics. Back then their images could only span 43 meters per pixel. Today our cameras can span 1.56 meters per pixel which is a lot better. This helps us see pictures a lot more clear. We took pictures of the of the face and could see certain things the older cameras couldn't see.

In the new pictures if there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids we would easily see them. There wasn't any of these things. What the picture of the face showed was equivalent to a butte or mesa. It looked like landforms found in the American West. It reminds people of the

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

All the new pictures we have help us undertstand and see things more clear. We now know that it wasn't created by aliens. Its just a simple butte or mesa thats no very special besides the fact that it kind of looks like a face. It reminds people of a Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This face has nothing to do with aliens.
