PHONES & Driving

Driving with a cell phone has its pros and cons but it really depends on the driver if driving with a phones is a bad thing. Some people use their cell phone for navigation that could help them get around in an unfamiliar area. The cons of it is that some people may be paying too much attention to their phone and not to the road. Being on your phone could be helpful or dangerous.

The reason it could be help full is that it would be easier to call for roadside assistances. If I were to have a break down I could call to have my car towed away and have a ride home. I also could use it to call for someone else who need roadside assistance and may not have access to it. It can also be used for traffic reports if there's heavy traffic or there's been a wreck and you can call for help.

The reason driving with a phone would be bad is that you could easily be distracted by it and can get in a wreck or cause one. Being on the phone with someone may cause you not to hear someone honking at you. Teens should not be able to have their phones in hand while driving since they use their phone the most.

If I were to make laws I would pass a law saying that people under the age of 21 shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving. I would make it cause usually the ones under 21 are the main one son social media the most and could even get distracted by a simple notification.
