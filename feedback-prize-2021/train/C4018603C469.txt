It happens once every four years, when everyone goes to the polls and votes for whomever feels just right for them. What people dont know is that your vote doesnt matter as much as you think it does. What matters is the electoral colleges votes. Hearing that I take a firm standpoint on abolishing the electoral college.

The reason i believe to take out the electoral college is because when you go to vote your not only voting for the prestdent your voting for his electoral college. In some case's if the person you voted for won then all of his electors get voted into congress as well, so your basically voting for 34 other people to make the right decision for you.

Another problem with the electoral college was the catastrophe of 2000 when Gore and Bush went up against each other at the election. The problem was that Gore recieved more votes than Bush, but Gore recieved less electoral votes,so Bush won the presidency that term.

I believe that is an unfair way to do the election i believe that whomever recieves the most indevidual votes should win, and everyones vote should matter not having an electoral colege decide for you. The electoral college is unfair, old, and not proper, we should change the way a new president is elected.

In conclusion, the electoral colege should be taken out, and a new alternative method should be establishesd. Lets change this winner take all system. People lets do something to change the way we vote!
