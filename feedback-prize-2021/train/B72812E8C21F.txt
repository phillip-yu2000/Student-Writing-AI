In my opinion I think we should let students play sports with at lest an C average because many students try there hardest to complete there task of what they are told. Many students try to manage to have a B average but they just can't be able to get there grades better. But what they can do is get extra credit. There are many reasons why they are able to play and one of them is that they should be aloud to play with an C average cause not that many students don't really have there grade that well when they play soccer they normally have like D' s or F' s in there class because sports are always on their mind.

Students should be able to play for many other reasons. This is another reason why they should be able to play with an C average. Not many students have the time to finish there work to manage to have a B because there to busy with playing sports or its also the homework or class work is to hard for students to understand. Many students try there hardest to keep an C instead of dropping down to a D or an F. So C average is actually good for them.

A lot of students brag and say that the homework is too hard or they missed an assignment that they needed to turn in or that they didn't do so well on a test so there grades drop. But most of the students try and manage to get good grades. Most of the time its not the students fault that they do their homework because sometimes the practices end long sometimes so many students don't finish on time. Some teachers should understand not everything is possible. Or even sometimes the students practices start as soon as school ends. So students should be able to participate in sports with an C average.
