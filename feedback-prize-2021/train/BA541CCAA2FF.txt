We will not be benefice of taking classes online and the reasons can be for slow internet, get distracted and not having time.

There is a bounch of students that have problems with slow internet, some times the internet doesn't

load the wed pages and with slow internet we can not due our online classes. One time i was with my friend in his home and he was taking his class online like every day and then the internet when down and he did not finish his class online and the internet didn't work until the next day.

Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we wan to eat, our parents need help and they call us and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online.When i was in LOCATION_NAME i took some classes online, it was my first class and my uncle did not know what i was doing classes online and he call me more then 3 times and because i was using my headphones and i did not ear when he call me the 3 times he get mad, he disconnect the computer and the computer shot down, i did not finish the class beacuse of my auncle and the teacher tell me that i was so disrespectfull to her and she didn't wan to give me classes again.

One of the most common problem is the student don't have time for example we have jobs and we don't have time for classes online. Some of the students are in club or they go to church, they also take care of there little brothers, with these reasons is why taking classes at home is not a really good idea.

Do you really thing that taking classes online can benefit student? Issues can occur, when we are doing the classes online from problems of slow WI-FI and also problems or differences with family that may affect us in our concetration with the classes, that's why i don't agree of having classes online.
