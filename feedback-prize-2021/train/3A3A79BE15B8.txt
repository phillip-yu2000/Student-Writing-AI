I believe that the face of Mars is just a natural landform because there is no such thing as aliens living upon us. Another reason is that Mars could've got hit by an astroid that came from the Astroid Belt, or maybe could've had a volcanic eruption. I know this because in the passage from the article it said, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural land form."

Another passage form the article says, "what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West." I believe that Mars had signs of life, and water in the passed, but now Mars has changed and is still changing over time. Mars does not have water anymore, but theories show thats there might some signs of living on Mars. And that is why I believe that the image of the face on Mars is just a natural landform!!!
