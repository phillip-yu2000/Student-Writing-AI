"when i need some advice, i speak to many other people to get there opinion on thing's" i said to my friend that is seeking for advice.

The reason many people ask more than one person for advice might be because he or she may not feel insecure of something, or someone so then they might go ask someone for advice to think and process on there opinions. It like buying a new pair of shoe's, you want to get the pair that makes you look clean and fresh with your outfit so you would ask for other's opinion to help you decide on which pair to get.

you don't have to ask people for advice if you don't feel like they aren't gonna give you the right advice you are seeking, ask the people that you trust the most. like your parents,your sibling,your other relatives,and even your friends. who ever makes you feel happy or secure to speck with about your problem that needs advising.

But the more you ask for advice the better the outcome will be. because you ask many other people for there opinion just as i am doing right now writing my own opinion about asking for advice from someone. and never let down on any good advice people give you.

"thats why you should ask bunch of other people for advice", i told my friend with a smile with joy in my opinion i believe asking people for advice is the best option because it would help you with your choice next time.
