All Schools should offer distance learning because i feel like it's a great idea for the students to participate in class when students aren't feeling well, away on vacation, and any other reason students couldn't make it to class. Distance learning will help so many students on missing class assignments due to being absent. Usually, students who miss class end up having to make up work but with distance learning, students wont have to worry about missing any assignments. Distance Learning will benefit all students with any kind of reason for being absent to class. Students with a type of injury that keeps them from going to class should have some type of way to attend class when they physically can't.

Schools should set up different types of distance learning programs such as online or video conferencing. With having the ability to video conference the class students can't attend, it will teach them to be responsible with always attending class no matter what. These programs will help students from having their grades go down and passing the class.

Bullying is also a problem for some students and it keeps them from going to class. If schools came up with a way for bullied kids to attend class with out actually being in that class, students who are being bullied in their classes would want to go to class. Students sometimes cut class because they are being bullied and don't want to deal with it so they skip class and miss work, distance learning will help those students. With distance learning class skips will most likely decrease.

All public schools should definitely consider distance learning and help out all the students who miss class due to various reasons. It will show that the school system actually cares about their students and are trying to help out however they can. All students who get the access to distance learning should be grateful that they are getting the education they need wherever they feel safe and comfortable.
