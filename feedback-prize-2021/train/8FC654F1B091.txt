TEACHER_NAME,

Today I have been informed of the new policy change on the subject of the sports and other activity changes that are being made at our school. It has been brought to my attention that this new policy is that the students have to have at least a B average to participate in the sports we have to offer our students. Our concern is that while many of our students have a B average, many more have a C average. So in changing to this policy, there will be many of our athletes who will no longer be able to participate in the sports or other activities conducted at our school.

I believe that some students may only come to school for that bit of time they have to get away from school work and home life. I believe that our school sports act as a guideline but not a restriction for what our school can achieve. We should have a goal for them and if they can not meet this goal, they can go to extra tutoring sessions to bring their scores back up. We do rely on our athletes to show others that we can have students with not only talent on a field or court but talent in the classroom.

We need to have a goal for our athletes but not let it serve as a block for achieving greatness through sports. Our sports builds our student's character, personable skills and sportsmen ship so taking this away would not benefit us but would make our scores and averages decrease.

I understand your concern but I think we need to give our students a chance to raise their score before we proceed with further disciplinary action. In using this as a learning experience, we can learn to help our students in every way possible.

Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts with you. I look forward to seeing how our students progress!
