When people need advice they will most likely ask multiple people so they can get different anwsers. Having different anwsers will help a person out by giving them multiple options to choose from. When someone responds with what they were thinking of they are likely to choose it if someone else agrees. Someone could think your idea is really bad but some people wont; Thats why it is always good to ask for multiple people's opinion.

I have learned this because There have been multiple times where I am hesitant to do something but if I have someone supporting me and what I want do, I will most likely make the best decision for me. An example of this in my life is reclassing next year. My family supports me making my own decision allowing me to do what is best for me. This allows to not worry about what others think. If one of my parents disagreed in my decision I will most likely not do it even if they allowed me to. It is good to seek multiple opinions from others so you have different responses and options that others agree with.
