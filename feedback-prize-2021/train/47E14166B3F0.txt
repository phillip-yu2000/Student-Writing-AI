Dear Principle

Cell phones have been a great hassle in schools seeing as kids use them to send messages to each other or call each other. But cell phones can also be an important thing to carry around. I am writing this letter to you to help you on a decision on the schools cell phone policy. With the two possible choices there are i like policy 1 the best.

Policy number one states that students are allowed to bring there phones to school and use them freely. To me this seems like a not thought out plan because the student are already with there friends so why would they need to use them at school. The only time cell phones would be necessary at school would be during an emergency. But this is also helpful incase a student forgets something at home or has an accident they can call there parents or who ever to come and help them.

Policy 2 states that students aren't allowed to have phones at school at all. Honestly that doesn't sound like a good idea because of the reason that there going to use it anyway. Most students will use there phones in school anyway wet her or not you say they cant. If this policy is chosen there would be a lot more problems at school. More students will get caught with there cell phones out and get in trouble.

Policy 1 is the better choice in this dispute between policy's because there would be less students in trouble. Policy 2 would only bring more trouble to schools and more work for principles or counsellors. Policy 1 is the more fare and equal one and well its a lot of fun to use your phone. So go with policy 1 it will save you time and a lot of disputes between parents and students.
