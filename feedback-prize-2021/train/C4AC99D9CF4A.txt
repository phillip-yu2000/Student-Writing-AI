The Face on Mars was not created by aliens. It is simply a natural land form. You can find similar land forms on Earth. Also, why would NASA even want to hide the existence of aliens? It is simply illogical to think that it was made by aliens.

The Face on Mars may look like a mask or a face, but that doesn't prove that it was made by aliens. There are many landforms here on Earth that look like faces or animals. NASA has taken photos of it, and it is clearly just a mesa. Why would NASA hide the existence of aliens from us anyways? Considering that it "has become a pop icon" and "has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years," wouldn't NASA benifit from the existence of aliens?

NASA has not covered up the existence of aliens. The Face on Mars is just a naturally occuring landform that happens to look like a face. It's fun to think about what would happen if it was an actual face or created by aliens, but it was not made by aliens. Anyways, NASA would be trying to prove that there were or are aliens there if it was actually made by aliens. They would benifit greatly if aliens made the face.
