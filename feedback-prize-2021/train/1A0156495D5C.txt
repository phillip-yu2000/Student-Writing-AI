After I read the passage I think Luke really wanted to do something good for the world or in other words, help others in need. If Luke wanted to tell someone to join the Seagoing Cowboys then he would want to in include the feeling he felt after seeing how much better people started doing after they helped them. He would probibaly also include that when they were done transporting the animals they got to go sight seeing and he would tell the person he ws trying to convince to join the Seagoing Cowboys that he got to go to/see Europe and China, he got to see Acropolis in Greece, he also would say he got to take a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, with streets of water, and he also got to tour an excacated castle in Crete. I think Luke would have a great attitude and he would want more people to meet. Luke was very good at seeing hope for everything and he had good reasons on why someone should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
