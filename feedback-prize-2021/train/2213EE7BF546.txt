Dear TEACHER_NAME

I have been thinking quite a bit about your idea of making it required to do community service. In my opinion this is a great idea, but an even greater idea not to. Instead of making kids do community service, you could just reward the kids who do. If there is a reward most kids would like, then more kids would want to do community service to get the reward and would feel good about doing something right.

They also would really enjoy the fact that they made the decision themselves and were not forced to do so.

For example the kids really like your cut in line passes. You could say for 2 hours of community service you can have enough cut in line passes to get you through the week. This would really tempt them because they hate waiting in line for lunch because they are cranky and hungry.

Another example is rewarding them with free time. Every Friday for the kids who gave at least 2 hours of community service can have the choice of skipping his or her last two periods and getting full credit on any of the assignments they will be missing. To just go to the gym and hang out, and not have to worry about their classes. This would also really draw kids attention because they already hate school and even though they might not act like it really wish they could get "A' s".

Therefore, rewarding kids for community service hours would be a great idea. It would also greatly increase students wanting to do community service so they to can be rewarded with fuller stomachs and less of a headache.

Your Student,
