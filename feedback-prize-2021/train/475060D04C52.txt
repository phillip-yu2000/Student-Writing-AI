Luke made a good idea to join the Seagoing cowboys. But he also made a bad disision to take time out of his time to make it where he could play with his own friends and if I were him I would join but I woulnt because it would be bad if I couldnt get to hang out with my friends.

He might have joined because he wanted to help other people because he might have wanted to help load the cattle and not hang out with his friends but if he were to travel to anouther place away from his friends he would be sad and so would I.I dont blam hiim for being able to cry and wine like a little girl but we all have our own ideas. He wanted to change his life by doing good for otherr people and not just his self. Luke wants a experiance adventure with the seagoing cowboys but he cant do that if he dosnt have experance.

Luks parents wouldnt let him go if he didnt argue with them. You know why he wouldnt have arguied with his parents they might have sugested him going over to join the seagoing cowboys. That is why I think he should go.
