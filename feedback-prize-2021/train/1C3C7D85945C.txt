Dear State Senator,

I strongly disagree with the electoral college for many reasons. For one, if our votes can be over powered by the elctoral college, then why even bother having an election. Also, its all of our election we should all have a say without it being over ruled by a small group of people. And lastly, even if we were to have an electoral college. Mke all votes equal it is extremely unfair to make evry citizens vote equal to one vote and the senators equal to two votes.

First I'm going to talk about why theres no point of even having an election. Well whats the point if almost every U.S citizen takes time out of there day to vote and pay money to do so when at the end when they count these votes there only going to go by what the electoral college says anyways.

Secondly, who even came up with this idea... Having the whole country vote for somone then letting 200 something people determine if there votes are correct. Its an opinion and it should be majority rules.

Its is the dummest thing Ive ever heard and my baby cousin could of set up this system better then you guys.

And lastly, why the senators votes shouldnt count as two. Well unless ther super human or some type of god there just as important as anybody else who voted.

Therefore, I hope you take this into consideration and how after reading you know how unfair it is to keep the electoral college in the U.S.       Â
