Requiring a student to participate in an extracurricular activity takes away a students freedom to choose what a student does in their free time! I disagree with the principal, I think that students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Certain students may not want or are able to participate in the activities. Students sometimes does not want to participate or are not able to participate. If a student wants to play a sport and does not make the team, that student may get stuck in an activity they hate, that also may waste the time of the student, who could be doing other activities at home to better themselves.

Forced participation of extracurricular activities may cause planingÂ conflicts. Parents may have super tight plans for everyday, so adding picking up a child can cause serious problems for those families. That includes losing jobs because the parent can not complete the hours of their shift. Also those added steps to a day will have a even more serious effects on single parents.

What if the students make more friends? No, even if the student makes more friends some of those other students are not the best people to be around. Along with the fact that most of the cons of all this out weighs the pros. What if we give all the students rides back home? No, that would not work either. Bus drivers would have to work more hours making the school pay more for their salaries. Also most of the activities do not end at the same time so making the plans for the bus rides would take so much time and be hard to get together.

Requiring students to be part of extracurricular activities is wrong and should not be put into place at any school. Being part of an extracurricular activity is a choice to be made by students, not the schools. They are called extra for a reason.
