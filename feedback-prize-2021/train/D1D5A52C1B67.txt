Dear, Principal

Us students have a problem with the changes you are making in our school.

We disagree with the not participate in sports or any activities unless we have at least a B average , many students in our school are great at playing sports and with many more activities , but the more students that have a c average many not participate in these activities .

This is not fair to our school we will have a camp ain of student that are great at sports and activities and the once that are very smart to get together and study so we can keep participating on these activities. We need these thing to keep us going in school for our health , trying something new , helping each other, being friendly with others , and making new friends, if you let this happen we would be on track with our school work and not giving up and trying our best to have and get a B average or even an A average, we will become successful by the time you approve of this letter, we took our time to write it and we hope you will think about our deal.

We would be glad if you as our principal support us on this camp ain.

Thank You for your time.

Sincerely , Your Students
