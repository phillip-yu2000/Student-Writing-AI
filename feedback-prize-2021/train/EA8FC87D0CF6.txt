If you like to join programs and to help out with people who need help then you should consider joining Seagoing cowboy. why you should join is because seagoing cowboys have helped many countries that have been left to ruin and if you join you could have the chance to help the ruined countries who need help through disaster. Also meeting the needs of other people and seeing the needs of other countries.

UNRRA is a group of 44 nations joined together to form United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation. UNRRA has hired Seagoing cowboys to help with their program for example in 1945 World War 11 was over in Europe, and many were left to ruin. In that case UNRRA and seagoing cowboys helped by taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. So meaning that they helped even though it was a very long project. But it is worth a try to do something new if not tried before.

Putting the idea of joining there are some benificial things of joining. For example you get to visit different places and meeting new people could be fun. By joining it could bring good oportunities like it could open up the world to some people. And it makes you aware of people of other countries and their needs not just yours. it would help people feel better knowing that you just helped animals or other people.
