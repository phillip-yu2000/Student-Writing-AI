Luke wanted everybody, including himself, to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program beacause he wanted to help the countries that they were going to. He wanted to help the countries recover their food supplies, animals and more. There would be 44 nations that would join up together to help the countries in need that they were going to.

In August 1945, they recived their orders to report to New Orleans. They had 335 horses in the cargo plus enough hay and oats to feed them. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. They were caring for the animals during the crossings. Luke said,"Besides helping the people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."

You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because there are countries that are in need. What if our countrie didn't have food supplies, or animals, or other things that we need to survive. If we helped their countries when their in need, then they would help our countrie if we were in need. That wouldn't be good if we won't share what we have that they dont have.

If we don't help the countries that are in need, then we might have another war because they would be angry at the countries that have all the things that they don't have. Also what if there were terrible storms that would wipe out all the people that don't have shelter in that countrie. See we have shelter that would protect us from dangerous storms and we also have money to repair what the storm did. But they dont have any money to buy shelter. They also don't have any food to eat, but we do.

In conclusion, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program to help the countries that are in need of. It's not fair if we have something that they don't have and we won't share it. If you don't want to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys progran, then you could also donate some things that you have to the program.
