Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that students should have a B average to participate in school activities. This would help students raise there grade. Students would do more school activities. Many students would be motivated to better in subjects they don't like. I feel this plan to change the grade average will benefit our school and our students future.

The first reason is this plan will help student raise there grade. This will help students because most students want to be in sports, will force then to do better so they can have privileges to do what they enjoy doing. Fun games will motivate then to do better in class.

Students will do more school activities. They will do more school work to raise their grade and they will read more and do what they would not do on there own to get a better. Everyone feels better with a better grade.

This will motivate them to do better in classes the dislike. They will study subjects they wouldn't have on there own. They will try to learn what they didn't understand and they will do better in school. They will help then pass the classes they never could.

Making students have a B average to participate in school activities, will benefit the students learning . They will improve in there subjects and they will have a brighter future, a better education, and a better tomorrow. Our
