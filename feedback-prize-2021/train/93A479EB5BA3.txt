Based on what i read i think that limiting car usage is a great idea. Two reasons why i think its a good idea also is because it will help our envieroment and less accidents and deaths . Now its possible that some countrys already have no cars period but we may need some cars and any type of vehicle because we need some kind of transportation because we can't always walk it will eventually hurt us to walk always. Like it says in source 1 paragraph 2 in vaubans streets its completly car free that means that there most be no accidents at all amd less traffic for them. Here in florida we have many vehicles and need them but it would be something different to not have them and maybe have less accidents and help our enviroment too because if u think about it we sometimes leave our cars turned on and that destroys the enviroment that we live in . I myself prefer to have vehicles because its better because its resourcefull and easier to travel.    Â
