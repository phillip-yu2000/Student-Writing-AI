In this article about "Driverless Cars" i feel it could be a problem having cars on the roads that isnt operated by an actual person. There could end up being a problem with the driverless cars if they arent ready but the developers dont know if a problem has occurred til its out on the roads. I would think that the developers would wait for awhile just to make sure that nothing major could happen with the car whenever it is out on the roads and hopefully wont cause damage. Some people might be fascinated with cars that could drive themselves but it could be dangerous because without a human operating the vehicle it could crash and damage our community.

Some positive reasons for having driverless cars is that it would be easier and better for people to have them. In movies, they have driverless cars which people think are really cool. If they have driverless cars in the future and something goes wrong, they have sensors so that the driver knows if there is a problem and they have drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, which is a great thing to have, especially if you almost back into an object or another car. Using a driverless car could also be a new way to actually make driving a vehicle fun.

If the driveless car developers wait for another 10 to 20 years on having them on the road, it would be better and much safer because the more time they spend working on them the better it will be and the less problems and damage there will be.

Also, before 2000 we didnt have the mapping, sensors or computers but now that we do we should spend more time try to fix the issues that they have. If you use mapping on a driverless car, it might not work as well as you might think because what would you do if it gets the address wrong and ends up taking you to the wrong place. GPS's arent always the best to use because they might have to relocate all the time which could mess everything up.
