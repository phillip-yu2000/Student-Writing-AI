Dear TEACHER_NAME,

3|1|2011

I recently became aware of your plan of to change the schools policy on required GPA for sports and other activities. I would like to ask you to reconsider your plan. I am aware that you feel this will provide an incentive for students to work hard. However, I feel many students will struggle with this. Quite a few of our students try very hard and receive a C average. I feel that it would be unfair to punish those who try hard, but school doesn't come easily to them. Many students put in huge effort and receive a C. I feel that students with a C average should still be allowed to participate in school sports and activities.

Secondly, lowering the grade average to participate in school sports and activities could benefit many students. Many students stay out of trouble when they are participating in school activities. The time spent on wandering around empty homes is much shorter when students participate in school activities. Lowering the grade average to a C could help prevent many students from getting involved with trouble.

Lastly, I would like you to consider that a C is an average grade. I am not saying a C is a good grade but, it is the best some students can do. Some students don't receive the support at home and it shows in their work. We shouldn't penalize students for having average grades. We can work with students to help them raise their grades, but we should still allow them to participate in activities.

I as well as many students would greatly appreciate it if you made a C average the limit for participating in school activities.

Thank you for your consideration on this matter,
