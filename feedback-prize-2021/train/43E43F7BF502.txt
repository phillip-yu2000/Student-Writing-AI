Dear, Principal

I think that you should let the students bring their cell phones to school and let them use them during lunch and other free time. And then if they don't turn them off during class or if they get caught texting or playing games with their phones they should get them taken away. If they get there phones taken away they should get them after class. If they get it taken away again they should have to get them after school. Then if they get taken a third time their parents should have to come and get them.

I think if you let them bring their phones to school they would be much happier. Because if you don't they would probably find something more loud and annoying to do. I believe that if do this it would save allot of frustration and complaints from students and teachers.

I think that most students would be reasonable enofe to agree with these terms. Because it is better to have them for some of the time then none of the time. I also think the parents would like this because then they don't have to be down at the school talking with the principal and getting their son or daughters phone all the time.

Sincerely yours,
