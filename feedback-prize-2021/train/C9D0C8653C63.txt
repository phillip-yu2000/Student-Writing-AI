As a scientist at NASA, I know that this "face" found on Cydonia is just a natural landform that makes the shadow of a human face. Natural landforms often make shadows when light hits it at a certain angle. This causes the shadows to form things like faces, animlas, or other things. For example, when Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking photots of possible landing sights for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadow likely to be of a humans face. The shadow made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Some scientists think that the "face" could also have been an alien artifact. That may be possible but, its more likely to be a shadow caused by the formation of he land. The "face" is caused by rock formations which resembles a human head giving an illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth. More scientists believe that this "face" is most likely to be caused by shadows.
