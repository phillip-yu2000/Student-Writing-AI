Dear Principal,

i think policy one is the better choice. If you let the students use their phones during free periods and on their own time, its most likely that they wouldn't use them during class. Other students might be texting their friends who are in class while they have a free period.

So it might not be a good idea also. If my principal gave my school an option to pick which policy they like better, I'm pretty sure the majority would pick policy one. I would pick policy one too.

If you remained with policy two more students would be tempted to use their phones during school hours and not just their own free time. My school has a policy that states that you may have your phones out after the school bell rings that states school is out. Also after that bell has rang, you many have it out on the bus if it's not a distraction for other people. Most students in my school think its a good rule, but most of them break it and have their phones with them during school hours anyway. If the teacher hears the phone, they will take the phone and send it to the office. It will remain there until a parent or guardian comes for it, and that student who had the phone would be sent to SMC, Student Management Center. So in the end Policy one would be the better choice to go with.

I clearly think you should go with policy one because most student would be happy with it and put there phones away until they can have them out. You most likely won't have a problem with it if you do pick policy one. Most kids don't even eat lunch at lunch period anyways. I hope you go with my opinion. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
