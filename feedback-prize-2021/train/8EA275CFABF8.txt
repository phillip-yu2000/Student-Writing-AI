Imagine a world when all you see is people sitting in their cars and not paying attention to the road ahead of them. That seems very scary to me. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea or the way to be going for the future. Driverless cars could lead to many fatal accidents and also many injuries.

My first argument is that technology always seems to fail. When you get a new iPhone, sometimes not everything is right in the phone or something is messed up from the start. If we had driverless cars in the future, technology would be the key function to make the car work. What if the technology failed like what seems to happen many times to iPhone users. I think having driverless cars is putting too much belief and risk into technology. You can never say when a problem would quickly approach or is about to happen, it just happens. If a problem just happened in a driverless car when the driver wasn't paying that much attention to the road, many accidents and fatalities would be on the rise.

In conclusion, I think the idea of driverless cars are very unique and out there, but as of right now and the technology we have, I could not put my full trust in a driverless car. Today, the technology and sensors needed for a full driverless car seem very unrealistic. Sensors created for the driverless car would be tested many times, but if it fails when it isn't being tested that can cause too much harm for everyone and everything in the world around us. I believe that we should stick with normal human driving for the safety of everyone.
