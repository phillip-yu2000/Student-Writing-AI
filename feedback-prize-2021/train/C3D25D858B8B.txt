The Facial Action Coding System, or better known as FACS, is a new technological advancement that can detect how a person is feeling. It holds promising applications for a variety of different things.

Prof. Thomas Huang collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe to innovate this technology. The Facial Action Coding System is a very complex.

It recognizes the muscles in the face and compares them to a neutral face; this is how the system can tell if you are feeling happy or sad. Eckman, the creator of FACS, organized six different emotions for the system to recognize. These feelings are, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and identifies muscles such as, the orbicularis oris, which tightens your lips to show anger. This action is very similar to what we as humans do every day, except this is much more accurate.

I am for this technology becuase I think that it could help our students fully understand the material better. Every student learns differently, and that can make lessons more challenging for some more than others. The Facial Action Coding System could potentially modify the lesson to make it easier. I also think that this type of technology is important for students that have trouble focusing. The system could potentially make the lesson more exciting; this would possibly help the student focus better. It could also help the world of animation. Dr. Huang predicts that it could make computer-animated faces more expressive; this would be helpful for video surgery. FACS can do so much more for the technological world, making it useful in many different aspects.
