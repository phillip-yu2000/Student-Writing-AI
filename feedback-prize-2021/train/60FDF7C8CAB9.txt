Some children nowadays don't like to confront people with their prblems or they are too scared to ask for help. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions os tudents in a classroom is valuable. Its is valuable because it can detect problems in students before it's too late.

It's impotant to know what students are feeling to make sure they are comfortable, genuinely happy and interested. Since this technology can calculate the emotions from the way muscles contract on your face, it'll be easy to detect a problem without asking them when they can easily lie. You need to keep the students interested because if they are not interested in what you are teaching then they will not pay attention and won't get anything from the lesson at all. With this technology, they can have a better chance of getting better grades or have a better prespective on the subject.

There are many risks from not knowing exactly what the student is feeling. They could be feeling anxious, depressed or even scared. Anxiety and depression are two major and risky mental health problems. People who have it may not want to talk about it or even share that they have it. With thus facial recognition, they will be detected as sad or scared and you can be able to get them the help they deserve and need. We have many muscles in our face and all of them can identify in the categories of sad or scared. As the author includes in the passage, in papragraph 3, "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an "action unit.""

This technology can really help a student's life in the long run. You will not regret getting this technology that will get a better understanding of children then we ever will.
