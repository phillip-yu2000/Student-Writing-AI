In a suburb city in Germany, people have quit using their cars. Why ? so the communtiy can create denser cities and so people can walk with more space and not worrying about any car accidents that could happen while their walking or driving an automobile. Paris has also banned the use of automobiles so that the air inthe community can perhaps not get too polluted with gas, oil, and other chemicals that damage us. Here a are few advantages people can optain with these new rules and laws.

If fewer automobiles are used during day and night, people who walk from work, or ruuning errands can have an easier time breating the less-polluting air. In many locations around the world has residents that don't own or use a car or motorcycle because this can benefit the community by making it safer to walk. I source 4, the passage shares information about percentages of young people that own cars, but rarely use them on a daily basis. Source 3 talks about a couple cities in Colombia declining car use since a variety of people in Colombia have car and motorcycle access, the streets get polluted extremely easy, so residents tried to reduce the amount of smog in the community.

My grandfather who live in Cali, Colombia for example, dislikes relying on his car so much to travel places. Many times, he walks to certin locations beacuse he explained to people who lives on his street the damage car oil and gas can effect the communtiy harmfully. To many people, driving cars is the normal way to get to places, but to others, walking is their best option.
