Technology is a wonderful thing that keeps growning and changing. Many people have different views on technology. Some people think technology is a great help to our daily lives such as computers, cell phones, and cars. However, there are many other people who would strongly disagree and say technology is ruining us. Either way you can stop technology from growing and becoming part of us.

Technology has advanced our cars in many ways. Many new things have been created such as electric cars, environmentally friendly cars, and now we are seeing driverless cars being created.

There are many positive aspects to having driverless cars. With the improvements in software cars can now handle more driving tasks on their own. These cars can steer, navigate, and brake themselves. They also notify a driver when the road requires human skills. When the vehicle is in danger of backing into someone the seats can vibrate to alert the driver. Some people just do not see the point of having a driverless car when you still have to help the cars in certain situations, but I think they are a great way to keep us safe annd focused. All of these aspects are examples of how the car can keep you safe and eventually lead to less accidents.

Transportation is a very important part of our daily lives. With the driverless car transportaion is becoming safer and easier. Drivers will be more alert and focused. This will decrease the amount of accidents caused by careless driving. In conclusion, I think driveless cars are a great addition to technology and transportation.
