There have been many debates on whether or not driverless cars should be a thing. Yes, there are ups and downs of these cars, but you're always going to have those no matter the case. I believe with our technology advancing that we need to start working on some way of cars controling themselves.

One reason why I believe we should keep developing these cars is Google has had these sort of cars since 2009. If our society has been using them one way or another and if our technology keeps advancing, in 10 or so years we can find a way to make them safer. We don't have to release them any time soon, but wait till they are safer and have been tested and proved their way into pursuading people they are safe.

This can either be a pro or a con. The drivers have to stay alert and take over when the car needs it. They aren't made to know how to go around traffic and roadwork, so when the car sends an alert the driver can take over. I take this as a pro because it seems safer than leting your car try to work its way through roadwork on its own. When you have control you feel safer, but this can also be a con. When you hear "Driverless cars"

you think that you won't have to do anything when thats not the case, yet.

In conclusion, driverlass cars still have a way to come, but with our technology advancing more and more every year these cars will be safe and driverless in just 10 years. The cars we do have that may be released aren't driverless, but they have a safe way of letting the driver know when to take over. Our society will be changing in more ways than we can imagine in just a decade.
