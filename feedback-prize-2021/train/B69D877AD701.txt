I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you join the program you can take care of animals,play games on your free time,and go to new or exciting places. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy I did those things. Being a Seagoing Cowboy means that you would have to be on a cattle-boat going to different places.

On the cattle-boat I had to take care of some animals. I took care of horses,young cows (calfs),and mules. Sometimes, I have to check on the animals every hour as a night watchman. I have to feed the animals two or three times a day. I had to clean the animal stalls too.

On the trip, I would get free time. When I get free time I found some fun things to do. I did these things:table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. Other Cowboys played baseball and volleyball I played those too.

While sailing I went to lots of places. I went to places like Venice,Italy and China. Going places is part of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I went to places in Europe too.

In summary, I took care of animals,played games,and went to different places all around the world. It takes some work to be a Seagoing Cowboy but,it is worth it. I'm glad that my friend asked me to go to Europe with him as a Seagoing Cowboy. I didn't just get to feed cattle the whole time I went to places all around the world.
