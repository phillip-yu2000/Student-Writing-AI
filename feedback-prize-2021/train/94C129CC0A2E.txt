Dear TEACHER_NAME

We teens need to take a break once in a while from our studies, and what better than sports, but it seems to you like if we must just learn and learn and learn. Like many others, I do not agree with your new policy. I don't think its fair that we need to have good grades to play sports because not all of us have that potential of getting good grades , but what we do have is passion for a sport. What if the next Kobe Bryant was in that boy who was not able to play basketball because his grades were low, and instead of playing basketball, he was forced to study. How would you feel if in 20 or so years you see the boy again, and he tells you that his life has been a failure because all he wanted to do was play basketball, but instead he had to study, but he could never get to that B so he dropped out of high school. What if that boy had played basketball and got a scholarship to play in college.

I just hope you rethink of this new policy
