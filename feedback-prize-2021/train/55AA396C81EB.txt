Dear, principal

I was just reading your paper on how students have to have a B average to play sports and be in activities around school. I understand how you want your students to be smart and to participate in school activities and i some what agree with you. If you want the sports players to have good grades then you should set up, a study hall type thing for the sports players so that they could work their way up to good grades and even for regular students , but if u just have people that have good grades chances are that you won't have a very good sports team in any sport, unless you get lucky and get someone with good grades that is a athlete. Also, i agree with the one where you have to have a B average to participate in the activities only if you have good grades, because a lot of kids would start doing better if they got a reward every week that they turned in their work and had straight A' s or B' s. I,

also believe that everyone in the world should do their work and get straight B' s or even straight A' s, because it not hard as long as you apply yourself to get good grades.

Sincerely, A Student from School

P.S You should set up a activity for the student that do good.
