Dear principal,

I think students should be allowed to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times because if someone was hurt and there wasn't an adult around they could call someone to go and help them, and if they needed something they left at home and wanted someone to drop it off and because lunch is a time for students to socialize and talk to our friends by using our cell phones.

Imagine if you got hurt and there was no adult around to help you, you would automatically want to call someone with your cell phone. Its a lot faster to use then waiting for a teacher to come help you. If you were in serious pain and needed to go to the hospital, you would go straight to your phone and call 911. Lets say you forgot your homework or your lunch, you would want to call your parents and ask them to bring it to you at school instead of going to the office and calling. Its faster and easier to use your own cell phone.

Lunch time is a time for students to be with there friends and listen to there ipods and use there cell phones to talk to each other. Lets say you needed something from a friend and they were on the whole other side of the cafeteria. It would be so much easier to call or text them. Students are usually on there phones no matter what. If there right next to each other, they will still text each other. Some students would like it if we were able to use our cell phones and others may not. But the majority of students would like to be able to use them during lunch and any other free time.

In conclusion, I think student should be able to use there cell phones during lunch and any other free time because if someone was hurt and no teacher was around to help them, they would use there cell phone and because its a good way to socialize during a free time.

Sincerely,
