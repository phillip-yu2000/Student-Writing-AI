Dear Principal,

I heard about the new policy you are possibly making to not have students participate in sports and other activities unless they have a grade B average. I think this is a great policy to make.

This policy will put education first as it should be. Education comes before sports and other activities. Its way better to have a outstanding education. Activities and sports are fun, but school grades need to be up to at least a B.

The reason why we shouldn't have the limit at a C average is because if its that low then they are at risk at failing and not pushing themselves. If this is the case, they should spend more time getting their grades up then focusing on other activities and need to focus more on what's really important.

Having this new policy will help students get their grades up. If they know that they cant be in their fun activities if they slack and have a C average, then they will push themselves more and try harder in school. This will make their standards be higher and will help them succeed.

This is a policy that is absolutely necessary. We need to put education first and think of all the student's futures. We want them to go to college and succeed in their life. This policy will help that.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and I appreciate you taking my opinion into consideration.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
