The Seagoing Cowboy program is not a popular choice of career. But meeting new people, traveling from place to place, and taking care of animals is fun, right?

If you'd like to make more frineds, there's all sorts of ways to meet new people. In this program you're able to do just about every one of them. The first new people you're going to meet are your fellow crew members on the ship. Then when you get to the destination you meet even more people, whether it's strangers on the sidewalk, or even an army crew waiting for their animals.

Traveling? Definetely! I've traveled to so many places. Some of my favorites are Greece, China, and Italy. My favorite part about Greece was the Acropolis. On my way to China, I saw the Panama Canal. I loved taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and adventuring an old castle in Crete was pretty cool.

If you're a big animal lover, this job may be for you. I've taken care of hundreds of animals. My first shipment contained 335 horses! Along with the horses, enough hay and oats to get them through the trip. The trips were very long so taking care of the animals kept me busy and as long as I was busy, they were healthy. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. And the stalls had to be cleaned.

Like I said, meeting new people and traveling can always be fun. And if you love animals, you're practically ready to sign up. The Seagoing Cowboys aren't always easy, but it sure is fun!
