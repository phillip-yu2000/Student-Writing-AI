The Face on Mars was a mysterious topic for several years. The Face was believed to be an alien monument. However, through research, NASA was able to confirm that the Face is in fact not an alien monument, but instead a natural landform on the surface of mars.

This famous picture has gotten a lot of attention in the media. What some people may not realize is that the photograph was taken through clouds. The text states, "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face." Some believed alien markings were hidden by the haze, but perhaps the haze was instead covering up detail in the landform that would show that it is not a face, nor an alien monument, but instead just a natural landform. NASA also happened to have technology that could clear up this picture. The technology used to explain this photograph was described by stating, "You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" This shows that NASA has the technology needed to explain this image. After using this technology, the image was revealed. The text claims that the photograph shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. It is also said in the passage that these are common lanforms in the American West. It is clear that this landform is nothing unusual or out of the ordinary, and it certainly is no alien monument.

In conclusion, after research, it was releaved that this unknown formation located in Cydonia on Mars had no connection to aliens and instead was a natural land formation, similar to some landforms on Earth.
