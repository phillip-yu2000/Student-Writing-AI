Dear School Principle ,

The constant cell phone use must stop.

Taking the cell phones away completely though isn't the answer.

The rule of you can only use your phone during your own time is would work very well since some students need their phones to contact their parents for a ride home. Other reasons could be for emergencies or to just be able to contact people they may need to speak to.

Just taking cell phones away completely if anything may only cause more problems.

Cell phones can and are very useful items for when you need a ride home.

Say you have missed the bus and need a ride home all you need to do is contact your parents to give you a ride with your cell phone. Still what if they cant give you a ride then you can just call your friend to see if you can get a ride from their parents. When your in that situation with a cell phone the possibilities are endless.

Also what if you are walking home from school or your at school and you get hurt.

You would be able to call someone for help if you had your phone.

Without your phone you would be almost hopeless and all you would be able to do is yell and hope you can be herd.

Reviewing these reasons show you why cell phones come in so handy at times they are especially needed.

Cell phones by the way the information shows it are very useful devices. They can be used for all of these things and more.

For example if you forget your homework,

you can call a parent to come bring to school so you can hand it in. All of these examples show how cell phones are not just used for evil.
