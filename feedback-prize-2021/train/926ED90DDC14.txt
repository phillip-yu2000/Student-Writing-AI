The author supports his/her idea well with all the details they gave of the temperatures and conditions of Venus. Although it seems near impossible, the author leads one to believe that exploring Venus' surface may be more possible than it looks at first glance. There are metals that could survive such conditions.

While floating 30 or so miles above the surface of the fireball-like planet might give us more insight than we already have, to really acquire significant information, we need to get right down on the ground. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. While that may be hot enough to melt a chinsy-built little robot, the author makes a valid point that a system of steel gears and levers would be able to withstand such conditions for a long period of time. If we could send a mechanical-built robot down to explore, it might be able to survive on the surface of Venus long enough to collect some of the information we need. Perhaps a machine made out of tungsten, it'd be heavy, but the melting point would be significantly higher.

In conclusion, the author makes many valid points that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that come with the exploration of the planet. Harder metals with hotter melting points are obviously going to last longer. Even floating 30 or so miles above the surface in a space ship could potentially give us more information than we already have. If we have the resources to make landing and exploring our sister planet possible, why not get all the way on the ground and get as much information as possible though?
