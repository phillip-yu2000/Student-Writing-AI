Many people have different opinions about what happens on the planet Mars. During a recent discovery many people had the idea that the face on mars was created by aliens. Scientists had a different theory. Scientists believed that the face was formed by something more believable. Aliens was not one of those.

On May 24th NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was on Mars. The spacecraft was going about it's regular mission until it noticed something interesting. The text states, "..when it spotted the shadowy likenss of a human face." The text states, "A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see." Once NASA revealed the images for the world to see, many of them claimed it was from aliens. Scientists had to quickly do their research to clear up false accusations. The text states, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." Once NASA cleared it up that it wasn't an alien monument they quickly found out what the face was. The text states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West. NASA was able to put an end to the false accusations, and also support their conclusion with nautral landforms.

While many people do have different opinions about certain things, sometimes those opinions can chhange. By being able to provide people with evidence as to why something is the way it is can steer thier opinion in another direction. NASA had many followers who felt that the face on Mars was caused by aliens, but NASA was quick to provide them with correct imformation on the formation of the face.
