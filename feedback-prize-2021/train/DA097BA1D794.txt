I agree with the idea of "driverless cars."

I agree with this becuase it could cause a lower number in people drinking and driving.

This project could also be a whole lot safer.

Machines are only as smart as the human making them.

So there could be flaws and mishaps that can occur, but through trial and error we can fix those problems and perfect the car.

The idea of driverless cars can be dangerous in the matter of if something goes wrong and the driver is not alert it would cause an accendent.

When I read this passage i thought to myself.

With a driverless car I could go to sleep while I go to my destination.

Then I read that the car will alert drivers in situations that the car cannot handle.

the creators should fix this issue so that drivers dont have to still pay 100% attention to the road and the driver could relax.

The idea of driverless cars can be a whole lot safer too.

Mostly because if car accendints are caused by humans, a car can fix this problem.

Like in the passage they used sensors to see around the car to help navigate through traffic.

I agree with the idea of driverless cars because it would be safer.
