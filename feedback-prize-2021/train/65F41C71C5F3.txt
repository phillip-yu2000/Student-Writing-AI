UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Some animals were shiped over the Alantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.

Not only helping people and animals, but you also get to meat other places such as Europe and China.

Sometimes on board if the animals are already uploaded you get to play baseball and sometimes volleyball. It is a lot of fun here and there.

Some of the jobs there are, being a night guard, watching over the animals, taking care of the animals, taking care of people, and others.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. Im grateful for the opportunity, he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

So come on down and Join the "Seagoing Cowboys."
