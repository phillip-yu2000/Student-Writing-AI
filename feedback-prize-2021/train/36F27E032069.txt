Dear Senator, i am writing this letter in regaurds to the way we citizens vote. I feel as though we should vote using the popular vote. There are many different reasons i feel so strongly about this. So i will start telling you why i feel so strongly about this.

First,i think that the President and Vice President should be choose by our votes. The reason being is becasue we know what we want for our country. we look for the good and things like that in our president. I think it is only fair that we use the voting tecnique most votes because that means everyone gets a say on who runs our country.

Another reason i think we should go that route is beacuse people sometimes feel left out in all the things that have to do with our country. People want a president that keeps his/her word and one that can be the right person for the job. They want someone who knows who to be a leader because the person who gets chosen has this job for 4 years. I think that people have a right to vote for who they want to vote for not who the electors pick . I have no idea if this is aking any type of sense but i am writing this the best way i understand it.

That is how i feel about this whole thing i think people should have equal rights.  I also think that people should be able to pick who they want to be their leader. They should be able to view thier opitions and see what is best for not only the country but aslo their familes and themselfs. That is all i have to say about this whole thing.
