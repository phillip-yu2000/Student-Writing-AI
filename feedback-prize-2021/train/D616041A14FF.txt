I think that the author of The challenge of exploring Venus suggests studying venus is a worthy persuit because he must really intrest him so he wants to share it with everyone else. In the first paragraph the author says that Venus is sometimes called the " Evening Star " because it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is offten referred to as Earths twin. Venus is the closest to planet to earth. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus. Venus has the hottest surface surface temperature of any planet in the solar system, even though Mercury is closest to the sun. High pressure and heat, Venusian Geology and weather presents additional impedments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and then also some frequent lightning strikes. Some sientists have benn discussing further visists to the planet. NASA has been working on many other approaches to studying Venus more. People striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. The tarvels on earth and also beyond earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Venus can be very intresting so thats whay I think the auther wanted to write about us and tell us amny good facts about it.
