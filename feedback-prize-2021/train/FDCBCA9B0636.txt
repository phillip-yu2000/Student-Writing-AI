Dear School Principal,

I believe that students should have cell phones in campus. If they have something they always wanted from a school. They'll be wanting to learn more. If there's a emergency somewhere where they cant get to the office immediately , they could use there cell phones to call other students to tell the teachers that there's an emergency. Parents won't be angry about this policy because they'll know that there children are learning in ways that they'll want to learn.

So, if they know that they can use there cell phones in school they wont be using it during class hours. Cell phones are really use full to students during school hours. It keeps them safe and will help there education in how they will want to learn. You should really reconsider to allow students to bring there cell phones to school. It will be helpful to them. Students will think that education is fun now. And If you really look at it there's not much time of break or free time. The only time they'll use their phones a lot is during lunch time.

Take my opinion and try it . You'll see that i was right. Our school will be fun for students our age. Parents might want to bring there younger children to this school when they get older.
