I will like to argue against the development of computer drivening cars Computers are made by humans so there is always going to be a problem or something wrong with it. I understand that havent had a lot of crashes but alot of people that drive them selfs havent had a crash either it just depends on who is drivening the car and if they are a reckless driver. They making people more and more lazy as the years go by. They just need to make sure that the people that they are puting behind the wheel know what they are doing and know that they are not the only peoplr on the rode. It s not the cars that arethe problem its the people that dont care about other on the rode with them. They puting all this money in to something that we dont realy need to have. They just making it t o make it and our money needs to go into something that going to make our future better not more lazy then it has to be. I hope that they keep these cars illegal because they are not need and they are not safe
