to: principal from: students at SCHOOL_NAME

we the students at SCHOOL_NAME have talked it over and we would like to tell you the good reasons y having a phone at school is a good reason. first off its a way of connecting with our parents on our break time we always need something from them and need to tell them something everyone and a while so we should be allowed to have them on our break time and also if we do get phones allowed in school we will not use them in class we have all agreed to that and also we can help u out with this to if u allow phones to be in school we will be more clean on our compass and the whole school will act more appropriately in school no more running in the hall ways or acting out in class it makes us feel more responsible if we have something to hang on to and keep track of also phones now have notes in them so we students text a lot and we can just text any notes that u are trying to say to us it would b a lot easier and we can just searched them on our phones in class and we can have our notes as fast as 123 so pales give it a second thought of how the phones should b used and please let us have our phones in scroll for those many reasons that have bee n told students of SCHOOL_NAME
