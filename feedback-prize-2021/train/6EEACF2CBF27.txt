PHONES AND DRIVING

Although cell phones have been in this world for a while they have made their way into our daily lives, we use them for just about everything like texting, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can multitask while being on it. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong times to multi task: while they're driving. As a nation, we have become so focused on how much we can do do at one time that we are literally putting our life on the line, all because we can't put down our cell phones. Using any handheld device while driving is dangerous to the drivers for a couple of good reasons.

When driving sometimes it's difficult to focus on the road and where your trying to go, which makes it easy to forget the road is shared by people doing the same thing. It's not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice to drivers on their phone whether its intentional or because of the hazard caused by it. When driving there is a great deal of skill and expertise that should go int maneuvering a 2-ton vehicle around and with other 2-ton vehicles so why end to life with a 1-pound phone?

Recently there has been a law passed saying you can't have your phone in your hand while driving and if you do and get caught you have to pay a pretty big fine. Its literally seen as illegal and there are still major accidents because of it. Using your phone while driving, no matter how good you are at driving is dangerous to the person driving, the possible passengers and the rest of the community having to deal with the reckless endangerment of citizens who don't put law and safety over their own entertainment and connection to other people. it's wrong and its being stopped slowly but surely
