Dear principal ,

I think that's a good and bad idea because first of all some students get bad grades and some get good grades and if they get bad grades they wouldn't like the school because they will think that they would never be able to do what ever sport that want.

Second of all, the students that get bad grades will worry about getting good grades and then they will say forget this or they won't even care about what the get. Its also good though because if people in the school don't participate in gym and art and stuff like that than well this school policy will be good for them. If they have a C then they might as well just give them a B or make them do extra credit so they would have a B.

Third of all not every body likes to do sports, but the people that like to do sports I think usually get bad grades and the people that get good grades don't really like do sports, but the school policy thing is good because school comes before and thing else because you can't be playing a sport and not have a education that won't make sense. Well that's what I think about he school policy.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
