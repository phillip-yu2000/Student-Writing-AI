Dear Principle,

I think you should not make student keep a B average but a C Average because for three reasons.

#1 Many students in school are sometimes challenged in different subjects and have a hard time with them. For example a student may have trouble with algebra and they are good in other subjects. Algebra is going to make a majority of students not play the school sport that they love to play. I play soccer and I sometimes struggle in literature. And I try my best to bringing the grade up but I still need help and I don't want soccer to be taken away from me for not maintaining a B average.

#2 Students will relax their brains by playing sports or doing other activities and having fun and the next day students will be ready and guaranteed to focus in school and feel relaxed and do the best they can do. Like I said I'm not so good in literature ,but when I'm tired and after I take a shower I grab a book and read to improve my literature skills.

#3 Lastly I want to say sports and other activities will allow students t collaborate band become more comfortable with other students and this will improve a students confidence. When I first started soccer I was always nervous to talk to people but when I start to meet people in my soccer team I wasn't nervous anymore. In school I wasn't scare to ask the teacher a question. And because of that I stared to better in school.

So principle please keep the policy to a C average and I guaranteed you students will bring up their grades and do the best they can do.

Love,
