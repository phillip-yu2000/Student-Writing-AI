The Face on Mars was discovered by NASA'S Viking 1 in 1976. It is in an area called Cydonia. The Face attracted attention to Mars because many people believed that it was created by aliens. It was used in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery store checkout lines. People began to believe there was life on Mars.

The Face is actually a mesa, or a huge rock formation, with its shadows making it appear to be a face. Jim Garvin said that if there were any objects in the picture of the face, such as airplanes or small shacks, they would have showed up. Therefore, civilization would have been seen in the picture. The Face also compares to something on Earth, which leads to the fact that it is a natural landform. It is similar to Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.
