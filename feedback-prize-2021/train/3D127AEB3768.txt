Should drivers be able to be on the phone and drive?

As technology becomes more ordinary, people are finding phones more needed than ever. However there are drawbacks. With phones being so prominent in today's world texting and driving has become a dangerous habit a lot of people participate in. Because of this a question has occurred, should drivers be able to be on the phone and drive?

Thesis

Drivers should be able to be on the phone and drive because talking and driving is done all the time and cell phones are too important to be completely inaccessible in the car.

One of the reasons why drivers should be able to access their phone is due to phones being the main way of communication in the modern world. To completely cut off that communication when driving could be detrimental for people who need to be prepared to respond to people ASAP. There's also GPSs on phones that people use for navigation that would now be banned due to making phones illegal to use during driving.

The other reason to keep phones legal while driving is the actual lack of danger while driving and using a phone. While texting and driving is dangerous. Just calling and driving should not be an offense. As people talk and drive with each other all the time. And being on the cell phone is essentially the same thing.

Conclusion

So in conclusion people should be able to use their phone while driving. As it is not any more dangerous than talking and driving as well as it being a necessity for fast communication.
