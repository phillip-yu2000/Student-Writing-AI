I am totally against the value of using to read students emotionals. I feel like technology isn't always one hindred percent right and makes lots of mistakes and errors. Just because you come up with system (FACS) that has all 44 major muscles humans have, does not mean it's going to be right every single time.

Technology is taking over the world and i understand that, but i feel as technology should not get involved with the human features. Reading students emotional expressions in the classroom is not valuable. This system could give teachers the wrong impressions on how their students are thinking or feeling. For example a student in your class could be very sickand look sad because their not feeling good. You as the teacher might think that he/she is sad because of some other reason such as a personal reason.

FACS is not needed in classrooms. this system has a 50/50 chance of being right on its "guessing". Some people might think this would be perfect for teachers in all reality, teachers for the must part can see when a student is struggling, and would not need this system. We are all humans with feelings and we all deserve to have some type of privacy. What if a student doesn't want anybody to know that they just lost a loved one. I just think that if we don't want anybody to know what we are feeling, our teachers shouldn't be able to figure it out. Keep this system out of our schools unless you all want to have lots of confusing going on throughout schools.
