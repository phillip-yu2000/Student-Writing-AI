In the article, "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author suggests that studying Venus is a great idea despite the dangers it calls for. Venus may be safe from Earth, but the closer you get, the more dangerous it is. Temperatures at Venus are averaged at over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. These conditions are very extreme, but the curiousity of humans will go above and beyond to find out as much as they can.

NASA is working on some solutions to help people study Venus. Due to such hostile conditions, their idea is allowing scientists to float above the fray. By hovering over thirty or so miles above the Venusian landscape, it would help NASA avoid harsh ground conditions. Hovering over Venus would be survivable for humans, but it wouldn't be easy. The temperature would still be very toasty at 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Getting that close to Venus would help them get more insight on the planet, but most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, so the forms of photography and videography may not be effective.

Scientists are trying to think of a way to get up closer so they can gain more knowledge about Venus. Researchers are trying to engineer a design that would allow our machines to last long enough to better understand our knowledge of Venus.
