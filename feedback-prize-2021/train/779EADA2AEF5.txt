Dear principal,

as a student, I believe that the use of cell phones should be allowed at school, but only during lunch, and students free time and only then. Cell-phones should be allowed during class period only on every day that does not end with the letter 'Y'.

'The reason being?' someone may ask, and the answer would be as follows; 'The reason being that all class periods are meant for the learning of information, not an overload of texting or making of calls, but for learning the real skills in life that students will soon need in the upcoming future.' The main reason why cell-phones should be allowed during a students own free time would vary from help the helping of homework, to calling a family member because the student may have forgotten to bring a project to school.

That is why I believe that cell-phones usage should be allowed at school, during a students own free time, but during the class period only when Hell freezes over and no sooner.

Thank you, STUDENT_NAME
