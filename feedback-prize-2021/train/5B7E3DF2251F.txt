Dear Principal,

I think you should put all of 8th grade to work for community service. Community service helps the world stay clean. It does not really take away too much time away from us because it even helps us in our house so trash will not really come in front of our houses. That is how some accidents can happen here in United States because all that trash on the floor can cause car accidents. Let me tell you how they can happen. First of all the trash is on the floor and a car comes and does not see it and they hit it and then the car flips over if it is a tire or a big box of clothes or toys in there. We the 8th graders can change the whole world by being the ones to volunteer to help our world.

If you have any friends that always litter the streets then tell them to stop and pick up what they just threw and go throw it in the trash. Well i hope we make our world better as each one of us volunteer to go help the world and pick up all the trash that we have thrown on the ground. Imagine all the creatures in the water that are seeing the trash in the water that we have thrown in there. Imagine how much trash we have thrown out there in the world. Just imagine how much we have done to the world. Working together makes the job go way much faster and that really helps our community get cleaner.
