There's a Face on Mar's that some people threorise is am alien landmark. However, there's evidence supporting that it's just a natural landform. The Face is a natural landform because while the first picture was bluried the second was ten times sharper then the original, the photos are reported to be of a natural landform, scientist say it is a mesa (common in the western U.S).

As I stated before, scientist say the second photo is ten times sharper than the original photo. This means it was more accurate. The article showed the second picture to readers at the top third picture to the right. It shows what looks like, and is ,a natural landform. One scientist, Jim Garvin, compared it to a mesa. A mesa is commonly found in the "western area of the American West."

In conclusion, the Face is an all natural landform that formed on Mars. I said that it's natural because the photos (which are more accurate than before) are said to have a picture of an natural landform, which they do. The Face can't be a Martian relic as it is a mesa. If it was of Martian descent wouldn't it look more noticable and detailed? The Face is a natural landform because the first picture shown to the masses was bluried and unaccurate while the second was sharper and more accurate than the original, the second photos are reported to show a natural landform, and scientist say the Face is a landform not unsimilar to a mesa (which can be found in Western America).
