It can be valuabe because it will keep students from getting bored and falling asleep or not paying attention to actully staying on track. In paragraph six he says that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor." He also says that "Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication and computers need to understand that to."In paragah 5 he says that"The computer can even be used on paintings such as the "Mona Lisa." In paragah 1 he says "The Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry'. Could any normal person say that about the Mona Lisa I don't think anyones possibly of doing that. Therefore I think that reading the emotional expresions of students in a classroom is valuable becasue it could change the way students and other people learn and think about school They'll be alot more motivated and more focused on their work because the computer is adjusting to how they feel weither if its beening bored or confused it could modify itself to make it not as boring or have the student actully understand it. Its also changing the future if technogly such as video game chartchers and video surgey its making their faces more exoressive which gives gamers a sense of knowledge on how the chartcher is feeling about the certian suitation their in or by giving gamers a certain type of feeling toward that chartcher like their there in the action or have a feeling of like what they would do in the situation or the game.
