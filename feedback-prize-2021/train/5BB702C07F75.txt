If your principal decided that all the students at your school had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity after school would you agree or disagree?

I personally would disagree because what if the student has other things to do out of school then he wouldnt be able to them because of the school rule. For example what if the student was a athlete and had practice for his/her sports team after school it wouldnt be fair.

Another reason i feel like its not fair because if the kid is anti social or just wants to go home and be alone they couldnt do that anymore because the principal wants them to stay for that activity. I feel like if i was anti social it would also help me out to stop me from being anti social so theres pros and cons to this its just whatever you think is best for you.

My last reason is because what if the parent of the kid cant get him/her back home and doesnt trust him/her on the late bus then theres just too much stuff going on. Also the parents might not even have a car for him/her to get picked up or the kid might not be able to get in contact with the parent because they dont have a phone.

So with all this being said and talked about i highly disagree with this decision because the principal can never know whats going on and why the student couldnt participate in them also i understand why some people would agree. Because what if you dont want your kid always in the house and you want them in some type of sport this would be the perfect time to start off. To conclude all of this i personally disagree because of the reasons i stated (The kid might be anti social, There parents might not be able to pick them up and, the student might have something else to do after school.)
