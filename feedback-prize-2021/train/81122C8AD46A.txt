Dear Principle,

I believe that a student with a C average should be able to participate in sports. If you have a C you are still passing and have a average grade. And I believe that is enough to play sports or other school activities.

A B is a good grade but you should not need one to play sports. If someone has a D they should not play, but a C is a good passing grade. If you have anything lower than a C you should sit, but if you have a good passing grade like a C you should still be able to play. I myself have to work very hard to get an A or B, so I think it is just fair to be able to play with a passing C.

If many students have a C average your schools teams will have not many people and many would not get to play. I think if I had an above par grade and I would be very upset if I had to sit. I feel that kids that at least pass should be aloud to play sports or other activities in school.

If someone on the team was not very smart but he could pass I believe that he should still be aloud to play. I say this because he is not failing school he still has a low passing grade. It would just be unfair to the kids that have C' s. They are still passing in school but yet they cant play sports. To me that is just unfair!

These are some of the reasons why i think you could have a C but still play sports. I can kind of see were the school is coming from to try to make there kids smarter but I believe a child with a C or above should still be able to play sports or other school activities.
