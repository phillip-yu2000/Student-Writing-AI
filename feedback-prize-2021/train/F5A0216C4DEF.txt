The article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" is about the present and future of driverless cars. In it the author presented both positive and negative aspectes of the driverless cars. After reading the article I am for driverless cars, because they will minimize the amount of accidents on the road and they could allow the "driver" of the car to be doing something other than driving the car.

In my first reason for saying that I was for driverless cars I said that they would reduce the amout of accidents on the road. I say this because in the article the author talks about how google have had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 and they haven't crashed. This shows how safe the driverless cars are. If these cars were on the road over normal cars they would prevent the driver error accidents, in turn minimizing the amount of accidents.

My other reason for being for driverless cars is they would allow the "driver" of the car to be doing something other than driving. BMW has been working on this feature of the driverless cars. They use a headsup displays in the car the show a form of entertainment and information systems to entertain the diver. And sence the driverless cars still need some driver assistance the display instantly turns off when the driver is need. This feature is not in a normal car. If the driver was need and they were texting the phone wouldn't turn off, there for making the driverless cars safer.

I am for driverless car for the reason of "drivers" being able to something other than driving the car and driverless cars could minimize the amount of accidents on the road.
