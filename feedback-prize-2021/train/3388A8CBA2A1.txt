It would be an amazing oppurtunity to be able to go and be a Seagoing Cowboy, I mean imagine all the things you could see, and places you could go. You may never have this kind of oppurtunity again, so why not take it. All you have to do is feed some cattle a couple times a day, clean some stalls, and if your the night watchman, all you do is check on the cattle once every hour then report back to the captain.

After you drop off the cattle or shipment at its desired location you can go look around and do some sight seeing. No matter where you are i bet you can see some amazing things, even if your not much of a sightseer i bet you'll end up seeing something that you've never seen before.

Then on your way back home on the ship, you and your crew mates can play games and sports where the cattle or shipment used to be to pass the time. Being a Seagoing Cowboy may not seem very fun, but it can be if you make the most out of it.
