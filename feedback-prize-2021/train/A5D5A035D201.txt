Now days all students have phones but some students take advantage of having a phone in school. As a principal you think phones in school are bad but what if we need to call our parents to tell them we are staying after school. As a student i know we cant have phones out in the classrooms but what about in free times. If you let us have them out during free time its a possibility we wont have them during our learning. Maybe we will start doing better in our classes because you will let us have our phones out instead of having them out in the class rooms We don't agree when teachers have there phones out and students cant have them out in free time. If you as principal let us have our phones out in free time we wont have all this phones taken up in the middle of the class rooms. Instead of hiding the phones from all the adults in the school we don't have to be scared of having our phones out in free time.

In this times bad people get inside schools and do crazy thing just because, but if you let us have our phones out or with us we can call the police or someone else to come and help us. As principal you may think its not the best idea but maybe it is when it comes to security.
