Have you ever needed some good advice but didnt know who to ask or how many people to talk to about it?

I have an answer, talk to multiple people about it the more the better. Taking someones else's advice opens your eyes to how other people see the situation. also taking multiple peoples advice gives you options its good hearing how others would deal with the situation and different types of people like your family if you get advice from your family or friends they would most likely give you good advice or try to help. if they try to give you bad advice you can tell their fake and want to see you fail.

for example if two friends get in a fight and friend A is popular and has lots of friends but friend B is not so popular and only has a couple of friends. friend B asks one of friend As friends for advice anyways and she says

"just stop being friends with her shes mean and doesnt like you anyways." she also asked one of her friends and they said "its just a small argument try and apologize" they are two different point of views and ones better then the other obviously getting good advice is so important like friend A and friend B if she hadnt gotten two peoples advice then they wouldnt be friends anymore it doesnt matter what the problem is. its important to get more then one persons advice on the situation so it doesnt leave you with no friends in conclusion you should always take someone elses advice and get multiple peoples opinon no mater what, to see who you can actually trust and who to get advice from in the furture
