In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

In the story the author supports his/her idea by saying "On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." This helps support the claim because the author is talking about the dangerous heat that people would experience on Venus.

The author also supports the claim by stating in paragraph two that

"Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us." This also supports the authors claim becuase he/she is saying that Venus is a challenging planet to study.

In the text the author also states "While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely." This supports the claim because the author is saying that you cannot examine Venus more closely because it is challenging and dangerous.

These claims help evaulate how well the author supported his claim because they explain why Venus is dangerous and challenging to go explore. They also help evaulate how well the author did by giving good examples on why the author said what they said.
