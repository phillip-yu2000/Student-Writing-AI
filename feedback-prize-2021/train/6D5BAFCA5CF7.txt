I would like to say i think this policy is uncalled for, and i think students should be able to play in sports or other activities if they have a c or better. I mean it's not like their failing or anything. But on the other side of the story students should be able to get c or better and not get a d or f. I could see that students should past every class with a c or better. If students don't have a c or better then they could not play in sports or other activities.

I also think that it would be highly unfair if students wouldn't be able to play in sports with a c or better. Some students love to play basketball, football, or even volleyball, and if they wouldn't be able to play with a c i bet they would be highly upset. Students try their best in the classrooms to get their work done, and to get a good grade. So I say that this policy shouldn't be past on to students.
