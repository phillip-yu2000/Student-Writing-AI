Dear principal,

I am student going to this school and I believe policy one is the best choice out of the two policies. I think the students and I need to be able to use cell phones in school during lunch and free time. The reason why I say that is because cell phones are becoming more and more put into daily life then we realise. In most big companies they have cell phone conferences when they can't get everyone in the same room at the same time. Also if you have to send out emails or news really fast and you don't have a computer nearby then you have to use a cell phone so that everyone knows what is going to happen or what is happening. As you can see we are becoming more and more dependent on cell phones and if you take that away from us we won't have that advantage to be ahead of some places in the world. Another thing you could add on is how we could involve it in classes. For example if we need to vote then we could send a text to a certain number and then we would have a class discussion on it. If you get rid of that then what would happen when we have to text or send something important? Honestly we wouldn't know how to do it because we could only use it after school which is mostly around 3-4 hours if you were to include activities and how long it takes to get home. In my honest opinion I think we should embrace the new age and make it into something where we can learn from it. That way we can still use it during school and we will still learn science and math. I believe that we can make the cell phone be part of school if we would try hard enough because I am pretty sure mostly half the kids at school have a cell phone. So I hope you choose policy one and maybe expand off of that to incorporate it into something we could use in class.

From,
