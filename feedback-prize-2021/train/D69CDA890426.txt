Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student you should let us bring cell phones to school. There are many reasons why I voice this opinion. One reason is what if the child forgot to bring something to class and the need to call their parents and tell them, then they could call their parents and tell them to bring it to school. One advantage to this is that kids will not be blowing up the office phones to call home. The disadvantage is that there will probably be a lot of parents coming to the school to bring their kids stuff for class. As long as they don't use it in class you should let them to bring a cell phone to school. Another reason could be to keep them out of trouble. They would be texting or calling their friends instead of arguing or fighting during their free time, or whenever they get to use it. Even though most kids bring their cell phones to school anyway without permission, allowing them to bring it would be a lot better. Maybe you should consider my opinion and let us bring our cell phones to school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
