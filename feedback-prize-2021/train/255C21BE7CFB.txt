When talking about what would be better you would got to your friends or peers to see what their suggestion is to decide. For example, when you need to urgently decide on something, you would go to your friends or peers for their suggestion.

Sometimes, when you want a red sweatshirt or a green sweatshirt, you would gather the information that your friends or peers gave you and whatever you got the most suggested you would go for that. For example, my friends said that I would look good in the green sweatshirt, so I got the green sweatshirt because that one came up the most.

We usually look for multiple answers because when you can't decide on something, you would go to your friends or peers to help you. Gathering the information that they all give you could help but not always. Say that you had a tie, you would go with whatever you like the most or you would go to some one for a tie breaker. For example, if I got the both the green sweatshirt and red sweatshirt results and they both came out to be the same, I would either go to someone to break the tie or I would break the tie myself.

Now what if you were in a different situation, like you don't know what you should do if there is a virus outbreak in your state. You would most likely go to many websites to see what you should do, like, if you should prepare or have a weekly checkup to see if your fine. If you do, theyÂ would most likely recommend to prepare with a week supply of food and water.

Lastly, if you should take your friends or peers advises. If you do you should use these steps. First you should ask and note what they said as their opinion see which one was more used (if they chose that you should wear or use this one better than the other one), than if they chose this one over this one you would chose that one. If you don't, you go with whatever you like.
