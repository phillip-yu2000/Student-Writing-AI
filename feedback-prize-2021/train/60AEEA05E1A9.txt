Online classes, i think that if students really trying to learn something is not need for them to take classes online but sometimes, teachers cannot teach al the students well because is only 1 teacher and like 30 students in every class room, and i think that online classes are not a bad idea because they been teach by a computer and they have to pay attention or they will fail, but at school they wont fail that easy because they can get copy from another students and thats how they will pass classes better at school then online .

Now lets really talk about online classes, is a perfect solution for students that for some reason they cant go to school in case that they had a car accident they cant walk but they parents dont want them to fail the school year , or they dont feel like going to school thats why online classes are the best choice not only for me for a lot of people like student and parents; I mean school is not that bad at school students can make more and more friends every year online they will get tired if they have to see the same computer and hear the same voice everyday.
