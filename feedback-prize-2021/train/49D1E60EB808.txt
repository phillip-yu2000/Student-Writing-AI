Dear principal,

i believe that u should have a policy about cell phones that allows you to have cell phones at school that you can only use during lunch, recess, and passing times. my reasons are because teens like to use cell phones to talk to other teens, what if an emergency comes up?, and what if you forgot something at home and you need to have your parents bring u it from home?

Teens like to talk to each other on cell phones to discuss current events and to discuss their feelings about school other people and their life. they need to outlet their emotions into something. and they should be able to do this at school because school is where most of the problems start out anyway and if they cant vent that out right when it happens then they wont have to deal with it throughout the day until they can get home to use their cell phones to talk to people and tell people about it.

What if an emergency comes up? What if something really bad happens at home or at school and u need to tell your parents need to talk to you about it, But you dont have a phone to talk about it, and its a really big problem like a family member is injured or has become deathly ill.
