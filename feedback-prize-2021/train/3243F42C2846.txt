If you were going cross country on interstates the whole time, why not let your car do the driving for you? Driverless car are great when you do not have city traffic, but it also could be dangerous when something fails in the car. The Google car has driven more than half a million miles without crashing, but it is also not completely driverless. Dirverless cars are the future; this is what the future needs.

Many say that driverless technology is not safe. Some also think that becuse they technology is likely to fail, whoes faut will it be if someone is injured. Many states have limited use of semi-autonomous car. In 2013, BMW develpoed "Traffic Jam Assistance." The car can handle speeds up to 25 mph, but it make the driver hold the wheel. The steer, accelerate, and brake do it themselves, but working through accidents and work zones require human skill. None of the car that are built today have complete driverless technology. Tesla has projeted torelease a 2016 car that is capable of being on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Which means, we are that much closer to developing a full time automatic cars.

Would the drive or the manufacture get blamed if the technology in the car fails? Even if new laws are passed it still woud not resovle the issues with the driverlss cars. Many car that are on the driverless systems, are not really driver less because thay still will need the human skill to guild it around work zones and accidents. Driverless cars are the future of technology.
