Some students would benefit if they understand things easily without a teacher explaining everything and if they don't need help like in math, but other students would not benefit if they don't understand things ,and if they need extra help or ask questions that will be a problem for them taking classes online or video conferencing.

Student who would benefit are those who understand things easily, and if they want to be alone to have a better concentration in what they do classes online is a good option because they will be taking solo training, and it's comfortable to take these classes without going to school they would have more time in home for example, I preferred to take classes online because that will give me more time to prepare everything that I need to go to work, because when I arrive from school to home, I have to do everything really quick ,things that I have to do like wait for my little sister in the bus stop from school then, I have to cook ,and that takes me time, and I have to be ready at 3:30pm to go to my work ,but classes online would benefit me because, I need help understanding classes like geometry or English is not easy for me to understand some words in English, and I need to ask a lot of questions.

Students who would not benefit are those who like to be with friends in school and talk with people that can be an issue for them because taking classes online they will be alone, and they could have some possible technological problems, and if they don't have self-control having a computer in front of them certain time of the day they would not be successful with classes online.

Some people think that students who take classes online don't make the same effort like those who take classes in school , because they don't wake up in the morning to take the school bus like normal high school students do ; however ,I think that students that take classes online male the same effort because they need to have time to take those classes and they have to respect the schedule that teachers give to them to attend class, they have to be in front of the computer a lot of time that can is not good but they do it because they want to graduate like other students wants.
