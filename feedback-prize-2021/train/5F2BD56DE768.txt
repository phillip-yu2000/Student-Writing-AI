In the modern days so much technology is being developed. Now google is starting to make driverless cars. Many people are amazed with the idea of a driverless cars. But to me the idea of driverless cars are a scary thing. The cars still need a human to be able to controll the car when the computer can not. Like when there is an accident a human still need to be able to opperate the car in a safley manor. Yes the cars alert you when you must take the wheel, but at the same time i feel like they shouldnt be called driverless cars if they are not completley driverless. Just like if a human was under the influence of drugs or liquor they wouldn't be able to fully opperate the car. This is why I think we shouldn't have driverless cars unless they are actually 100 percent driverless. If anything I woild take an Uber to where i need to go or I would take the city bus.
