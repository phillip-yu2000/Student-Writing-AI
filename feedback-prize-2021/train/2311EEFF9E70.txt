I am for smart cars because, they have upgraded on safer driving. People can drive all day and not get into accidents. The process that scienists have now are wonderful. There have been over 100,000 cars wrecks in this world because, people are not smart drivers.

Finally making a differents on safe traffic for people to be on the road. People had to worry about being sewed for a car wreck. A long time ago people never had no cars but only horses and boats to travel. Scientists have alot of smart idea of techalnogly. Now they are making cars that you can call or text anybody without using no cell phone.

Scientists also created that only way if you could listen to the radio if your seat belt buckled in for safety. The real age for people to start should at age of

18 because, most of teenagers are careless drivers. Nearly 45.7 percent car accidents with teenagers. Now if they start at 18 at list they'll be more mature for driving.

25 percent for accidents is because of drinking and driving. 35 percent is by falling asleep while still driving. 15 percent is by texting and driving. 25 percent is speeding to fast on the road cause accidents.

The reason why I am for smart driving because, people are making on driving more safer on the road instead getting into a accident. People should agreed of which if we should have smarter cars or not. May let the people deside if it is right smart at being safe.
