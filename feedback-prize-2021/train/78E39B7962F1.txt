Dear Principal,

All throughout our school we have students who perform community service. Some help tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. Yet, there are some students here who don't perform any community service at all. I personally think that community service is an excellent activity that anyone of any age can get involved in. I believe that you should consider requiring that all students here have to perform community service. Some might argue that community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do, but if everyone would just spend an hour a day or even a week to help out our community by picking up trash, tutoring students, helping the elderly, and helping at local stores think of what we could achieve. Our community would be a much better place to live in. It would be cleaner, safer for everyone of all ages, and happier. It all just starts by you taking community service into your own hands. Think to yourself; what will make a difference in our community and world, a couple of kids or a couple hundred? We need to show our leadership and make a difference in our community. Who knows maybe it will turn into something greater. We all just need to put in an effort and we will start to make a difference in the world, one step at a time. Please take this letter into consideration.

Sincerely,
