Driverless cars are a great step in the direction of a better future. Along with making travleling easier on a day-to-day basis, there will also be less accidents, and people won't have to worry about paying as much money as they do now for things such as insurance. We should continue to manufacture our cars to make them completely driverless.

With automated systems in cars, there can be less worrying about driving errors being made everyday. As it stated in the article, these systems can apply brakes or reduce power from the engine when in a dangerous situation before the driver is able to. This will dramatically decrease the likelyhood of getting into an accident. This is also great because the driver won't have to worry about dealing with everything you have to do after that accident as well.

Even though the driver has to take control of the car in situations, such as being in a construction zone, continuing to develop cars to detect these things and navigate them will make driving safer in the long run for everyone. It would be more difficult for people to drive recklessly and make little mistakes that can cost someones life.

Many car companies are making improvments to cars to make them driverless everyday. With more and more companies joining the path to driverless cars, we will get to a safe and convient future faster than we know it.
