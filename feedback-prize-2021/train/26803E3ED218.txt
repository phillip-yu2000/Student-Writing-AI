In addition to all these reaons not only is being a sea cowboy a opprotunity of a life time it feels special to help people in need!

Joining the UNRRA only has a few simple steps you can start at the age of 18 and sometimes you will need to travel over the seas more then once. The trip to China and back will take a month and sometimes you might get sea sick. You also need to feed the animals aboard three times a day and they need to get water too.

But after you work has come to an end its safe to say that you helped people after world war 2. Also its a good feeling to do so and have a great adventure as well. in addition to that you get to meet new people along the ride and tell them about your adventures along the sea as well.
