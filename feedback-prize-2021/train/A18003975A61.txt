Many children that play sports make a grade b average but for the ones that make average grades should still be qualified to play in sports or after school academics. Stopping a child from playing a sport that she or she is very well at and loves to do is wrong. You cant stop a child from doing something they love just for not making the grades that you want them to make. I agree grades are very important more important than sports nut you still half to let them play both things can help you in the future. There are a lot of boys and girls that will be very upset if they cant play there sports and that they are still passing.

Than for the kids that are very talented but just cant make the grades its not fare for these children. And it wouldn't be fare for the children that are special needs and have trouble with there work and take sports away from them its just not right. And taking the kids that take the school to the state champs or anything even better those kids deserve to play sports and they shouldn't be stopped just because of there c average grade its just not right. By taking these sport privileges away there are going to be a lot of kids that just wont try or care about school any more and that will fall behind than not be able to get out from the mistake that they put them self into. there are many reasons why you should not take away sports for the children that attend school but these are my reasons why you should not.
