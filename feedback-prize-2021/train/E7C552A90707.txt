Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm going to just get straight to it; I don't think you should ban students with less than a C average from after school sports and activities. I feel quite strongly about this. My reasons are that, although I never participate in after school clubs and such, I am certain that they are very important to many of this schools C average students. For some students, I'm afraid to say, sports and activities are the only reason they have for coming to school anyways. If it weren't for sports, I believe they'd ditch school instead. Not to mention that a few who only manage a C, might just be unable to juggle school and sports... at least, not on their own. Perhaps, instead of cancelling sports for C students, they could be tutored, by teachers or fellow students. Encouraged to ask for help, instead of 'grounding' them for not. Its just in their nature not to want help. I know a few students who can't do without their after school fun and have no where to go after school hours but clubs. I know many of them, if they tried harder, could really blow us away. All we have to do is get them to try.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
