Dear Principal,

As i student i feel that, we the students should be able to use our cell phones during our free time. I bealive in this because , its not harming anything or anyone , most kids have them and use them during school hours anyway , and its modern day so there should be rules that are considering our wants. I also feel that if we got to use our cell phones during free time, cell phones would be less of a distraction in class . Simply because we've already got to use them at some point of the day.

I feel that the rule , "we can't use cell phones during school hours" is sometimes reasonable . But at other times its not because i always see teachers using their phones. So why can't we? Its not fair even though we came to school to learn we also have the rights to socialize. I think that's one of the most important things you can learn now. Social skills is very important in , job interviews , college interviews, and in meeting new people .

Maybe if we had more interesting subjects we would be less worried our phones or less tempted to use them. I know that's a big part of why i use my phone during school hours, because our subjects aren't fun enough . Even though we're becoming young adults i still bealive that we should stay young as long as possible . And what better way to that then having fun in school because that's like our second home.

We should all work together as one . The school system should work with the students and the students should work with the school system . Lets start by allowing cell phones and having funnier subjects . And return we "the students" will pay more attention in class and become more involved .
