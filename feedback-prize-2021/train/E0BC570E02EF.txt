Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that you should follow policy 2 .Event though i love using my cell phone and do use it in class some times i think that they will become a huge distraction during school. First of all if kids get to use there phones during class breaks or when they are done with there work they will rush through it and do a bad job on it because they want to text or play on there cell phones. i know this will happen because i would do the same thing and also in the fifth grade. We got to go on the computers in the back of the classroom when we were don with our work and all of the kids would rush through there work and get Fs on there papers. After the teacher realised this she stopped letting us go on the computer when we were done. since she did this all the kids took more time on there work and got better grades. Also kids texting would distract the kids doing there work with all the vibrating and the ring tones because event if we wert allowed to have the sound on kids still have it on and say they forgot to turn it off and complain when the teacher took it away. Also if kids had to turn it off during work time they wouldn't and when there ring tone goes off during a test or quiz the teacher would half to take it away and the school would half to have a lot more phones and issue more detentions. Another thing is students would text students in other classes and if the other student forgot to turn there phone of, there would be one more phone taken away and the student who received the text would get two extended detention and probably get grounded by there parents. Also, do u like giving out all those detentions? If you do go with policy 1 and you get a lot more cell phones and get to stay after and hold a lot more detentions. These are all of the good reasons i think there should be no phones in school.
