Hi my name is,,, well you probably know my name. Ok so I read a story about a boy who went for an adventure somewhere. He was about 19 only 18. He has a best friend he went with. And he was so excited to be going.

I am going to tell you a story about a boy who followed his dream and became a seagoing cow boy. He was in highschool when one of his friends offered to take him to a wonderfull play. He started to surf a that's how he became successful.

He can become a seagoing cowboy so can you. He followed his dream so maybe you should too. And if you do fallow your dreams I'm sure you will become successful and earn your way to the top. And if you don't choose this path I hope you still choose something like seagoing Cowboys and still make sure you fallow your own dream.

Hello I think you will still be successful in any way. Make sure you have a friend like Luke's his friend is friendly, nice courageous, thoughtful and kind.

P.S.

Make sure your job is fun for you or at least you really like it. And try to make a change once in a wile.

You can change your life don't forget that.
