80% of Americans believe seeking multiple opinions can help them make better choices, and for good reason. Studies have shown the average Americans faring far better in their lives compared to their counterparts because they are listening to other's advice. There are also many myths that have the moral of listening to other people's opinions. For example, Perseus got his achievement of slaying a gorgon because he listened to the Oracle. Another example I have is the fable of Osiris, in which Osiris listens to Sekhmet and becomes the king of he underworld. In all of these stories, the hero listens to other people, and benefited from the people around them being more knowledgeable, more experienced, and giving the hero more choices to consider. Therefore, I believe listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice because they have more experience compared to you, know the pros and cons of your choice, and gives you multiple perspectives to deliberate over.

For example, let us talk about the anecdote of little Generic_Name, whose life was changed forever by listening to a person who has more experience than him. As a young lad, little Generic_Name always dreamed of becoming a soldier, because he admired his mother who fought in WW2. But Generic_Name's mother, who lived through the inhospitable battlefield, didnt want her child to follow her path. As a result, she talked to him about the hardships that plagued her when she was a soldier, and successfully changed his mind. Thanks to Generic_Name's mother changing little Generic_Name's mind, He became a successful and joyous doctor who saves countless of lives every day. If Generic_Name's mother hadn't been a soldier who has lived through the darkest depths of hell called the battlefield, then she wouldn't have been able to change little Generic_Name's mind, and he may have had his life cut short. Another story we can talk about is the story of little Generic_Name, who always wanted to be a magician. Generic_Name always fantasizes about being on stage, listening to the crowds wild applause as she entertains them, and thankfully, her father is there to fulfill her fantasies. Thanks to Generic_Name's father being a renowned magician, he had the connections and knew the tricks that could excite the crowd. As a result, Generic_Name became the greatest magician of that generation. If Generic_Name's father wasnt a magician who had walked the path Generic_Name was planning to walk, then she wouldnt have been able to reach the heights she was reaching right now. Therefore, I believe that listening to people who have more experiences compared to you an help you make a better judgment.

Another anecdote we can talk about is the anecdote of Generic_Name, a menacing ancient man who knew the pros and cons of doing drugs. As Generic_Name was walking the streets of New Jersey, he saw a group about to eat drugs. Generic_Name walked towards the group, and he latched his hand on to the nearest person's, and stopped the person from doing some drugs. Generic_Name reprimanded the group about doing drugs, and thanks to his menacing presence, the group stopped downing some pills. Thanks to the effort of Generic_Name who lectured the group about the pros and cons of eating drugs, the group was saved from the evil influences of drugs, and grew up to be a group who fought against drug use. If Generic_Name wasn't telling the group about the pros and cons of drugs, they would have eaten it and fallen into a path which is very hard to recover from. But thankfully, Generic_Name saved them from that despairing future. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted o be doctor. Generic_Name didn't know much about being a doctor, except that she wanted to be one, so her grandfather talked with her about her choice. As they discussed the pros and cons of being a doctor, Generic_Name grew more knowledgeable about the choice she is going to make. As a result, Generic_Name is much more firm in her beliefs about being a doctor, and grew up to be an amazing doctor. If she didnt' talk with her grandfather about her choice, she would have made an uniformed decision that likely would have ruined her life. Therefore, I believe that listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice by giving them the pros and cons of their choice.

One anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted to be a lawyer because her friend's advised her. She was steadfast in her beliefs as she always enjoyed rules and regulations, until her mother gave her a new perspective to mull over. She told her to aim to become a supreme dragon, rather than being a struggling python.

As a result, Generic_Name aimed to be a supreme judge, and she became one at the age of 65. Thanks to her mother giving her better advice, She became a star that outshone other's in the world of law. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name whose life changed thanks to a fateful encounter that changed his life. Generic_Name felt forced to be a fashion designer, as it was a family tradition.

He didn't know what to do, until he heard his grandmother talking with his family about animal cloning. He grew interested in animal cloning and researched it until he considered it a his future career. As a result, he grew up to become a biologist, doing something he loves. If it wasn't for his grandmother telling Generic_Name's family members about animal cloning, he wouldn't have even considered it, and may have grown to be a nihilistic person who isn't able to change his fate of suffering. Therefore, I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can give them multiple perspectives to consider.

In conclusion, little Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and many more changed their entire lives by listening to other people. If they didn't seek other's advice, they would have fallen into a path that would not allow their potential to bloom. But, thankfully, they chose to listen to other people. As a result, they grew to be figures that were respected around the world. Therefore, I in believe seeking multiple opinions.
