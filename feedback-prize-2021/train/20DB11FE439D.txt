To The Principal:

For kids who love sports that have a C average in grades can not participate. These kids might have a C average because they don't do well on tests but pass in most of there work. The reason i say most of there work is because every kid no matter how well they do in a classes forgets at least one page of work. What if they had a B average but they had one bad grade and turned it in to a C average I don't think that would be fair. What if a teacher wrote in the wrong grade by accident and that turned a students grade to a C average. They might have even done it but left it at home or a sibling might have gotten a hold of it and wouldn't give it back.

To come up with a policy I would have done what most of the students have for a grade average. For example if the majority of the students have C averages in stead of students having

B averages i wouldn't think that would be fair. I would have said to participate in school sports or other activities the students must at least have a grade C average. What if sports was the only way they were going to be able to get into a college. You would just have taken away a chance for a student to go to college. I wouldn't want any my students to have to find something else they are really good at since they don't have a B average if i was a principal.

Sincerely,
