"Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars". Certain companies we are familiar with and that are world wide are testing driverless cars, like toyota pruis and BMW. The main concern everyone is having is if they are truly safe.

I believe that driverless cars could be a very good thing if they are put in a reliable companies hands. These cars could seriously hurt the passanger if something goes wrong. If you relate the technology that the manufacturer puts into the car and the technology we have now, alot of the time it will shut off or one thing stops working. We already have cars that we can tell comands, we have had cruise control, we have bluetooth so we can speak to people, and the advances will just keep coming. Those two examples are the kind of things that companies are trying to work through and the law is keeping that in mind. If the companies that have been working on cars that can be driverless come through it will be a huge part of technology and transportation history.

Driverless cars have been worked on for years now and they still haven't become one hundered precent safe. But the technology will better, the cars will get more advanced, and eventually a driverless car will be the next big thing.
