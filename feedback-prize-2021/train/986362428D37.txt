Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I was thinking that what if we handed out forms and or posted a sign up sheet for helping the community 3 or 4 days a week after school Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from (3:00 - 5:00) for the months of April and May? The students can pick up trash, plant flowers and trees, do a fund raiser to raise money for charity, donate old clothes that don't fit you or clothes that fit you but you don't even wear. You could even give someone a big prize if they picked up the most trash or raised the most money for the fund raisers. You could start a program that helps save our community and make it clean. If students don't want to take part in this activity then every twice a month we could go to school and just go outside and help clean up the environment and plant trees and just make the community a better place for everyone to live. Thank you for your time and please write my back.

Sincerely From

STUDENT_NAME
