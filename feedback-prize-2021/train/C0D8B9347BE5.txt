In my opinion I think its a good idea to have driverless cars because there would be less car accidents and the cars would change the world. They would use less fuel and they have more flexibility than a bus. The car announces the driver when he or she have to take over. The person in the car doesn't have to do all the work because the car helps them out. Also the car is not all driverless because you can have a turn in driving the car.

The driverless cars would be so much safer. Although they would be very expensive, but they would be worth it. They alert you for many things like pulling in or out of driveways, dealing with traffic, and navigating through complicated roads. The car also alerts you when there is a problem. The cars also has cameras to watch the driver if he or she is focused on the road. This is great because there would be a less possibility of anyone getting hurt.

These cars would make a big differnce in our world and thats why I think we should give them a try. They are so much safer for us and I know people would like them. There would be less car accidents, people getting hurt, and deaths. It wouldn't be the drivers fault anymore if anythng goes wrong it would be the manufacturer.
