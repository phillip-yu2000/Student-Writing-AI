Not many details are in the passage to support this idea. There are actually many reasons not to sudy this planet. For example the atmosphere is tpp thick with carbon dioxied. The author supports this claim by saying; "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxied blankets Venus. Dispite all of the reasons not to sudy this planet, the author privides some interesting reasons on why we should.

Venus might be habital by humans one day. Even though Venus conditions are not standard to earths they are livable. To support this claim the author states, 'Not easy conditions but survivable for humans." There must be some way humans can survive in these rough conditions. Technology, that can support us, to live on Venus can be invented. In order to makes projects like this we would need a closer look to the surface.

Venus is extremely close to the sun. This planet is actually the second closest planet to the sun. Venus being so close to the sun is very benifical to us,we could get a obundant amount of solar energy. supporting this claim the passage states "Solar power would be plentiful and radiations would not exceed Eaqrths levels."

Venus is similar to earth thats why it has the nickname "sister planet". The planet got this name based off its density and size also it is occasionaly close to earth. Because this planet is so close it would be easier to explore. many spacecrafts have been sent to this planet to study it.

DIspite all of the challenges of exploring Venus there are also sone good that comes from it. If cobnditions of this palnet are stablized for humans we can one day live here. Venus could also have many helpful resources. The planet would provide plenty of solar energy. Human curiosity continues to drive us to explore this hot gas like planet.
