Hello today I'm going to be talking about the majority of humans that own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. First I would like to say that driving and operating a cell phone at the same time wouldn't be a great idea. In this day of age 2020 everyone rely on there cell phones to do everything some people rely on it to get their destination using a gps located on your cell phone. Or either texting someone on there phone instead of going to them face to face and talking.

Now that I've told yawl about the use of cell phones in are day and age lets talk about should or shouldn't people not be able to use cell phones in a vehicle. Personally I think people shouldn't be able to be on there phones while driving. It's a safety hazard and if you would look at the news the you would see how many car accidents there are. People lost there lives because other people want to be on their cell phones that's not fair at all. That's why I feel the way I feel about cell phones and driving it doesn't have to be like that if people would put there phones down and drive.

And for all the people that can't stop texting and driving should be punished. Cause they have other people family die it isn't right. If there was no cell phones then all the lives and car accidents could have been prevented.
