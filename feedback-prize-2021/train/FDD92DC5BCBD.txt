Ever since the introduction of cars, there has been an excess of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are good, but too much isnt as it pollutes the air and makes it hard to breathe that air. Riding a bike to work, or taking a bus, or even walking, instead of using a car helps the environment a lot. Some cities have already seen what extreme air polluton from cars can do. For example, Paris has gotten smog because of so much so much air pollution, smog is extremely hard and very dangerous to breathe. In short, an advantage of limiting car usage is that it is extremely beneficial for the environment as it stops some air pollution.
