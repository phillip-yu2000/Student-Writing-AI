Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should be required to perform community service.

I think they should do community service because not only are they helping out the elderly or disabled but they have a good mind of it when they grow up. In other words when they grow up their kids will follow their footsteps. Now some of my friends think it's really important and that others should do it. On the otherhand my other friends think it's a waste of their time. So we kind of had a debate about it and came across some reasons why we should and why we shouldn't perform community service.

Students should perform community service because they are helping out the community THEY live in. So its like helping a family member out and at the same time being polite and having manners. And some schools require community service. I know our school requires community service when you make it on to arista. But the problem is that when you actually make it onto arista you only need to perform community service if you want to be in the ceremony and be accepted into arista. I think community service should be required to graduate. That would have everybody making time for it.

Now the reasons other people don't want to do it is because they think it's not mandatory. And the other reason why they don't want to it is because they have no time and they need to do homework or study or they have practice for games. I know my friend she is really lazy she don't like to do anything and she is always bored. So i told her to waste your time why don't you go and pick up the trash at the beach. This was
