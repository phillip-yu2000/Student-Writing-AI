I believe this would be unfair. Students need sports so that they can get exercise. Not only that, if students sat inside all day doing homework, reading, and playing video games, they would become overweight and depressed. Sports also allow students to develop a social skills so they won't be lonely or even worse made fun of. Childhood obesity is already at an all-time high. Plus, I believe school already has too much control over our own lives, they try to tell us what is good and bad and what we should and shouldn't do. Students and parents should be able to makes decisions that are best for the student.

Sports are a good way for students to blow off steam from everyday life. Life is hard as a teenager, peer pressure and other things make it even harder. Students are pressured to do well by their parents, and as a reward for succeeding, they get to play sports. If they don't succeed, parents have the right to take sports from them, but not schools. Also, it may be the schools fault for failing student. Some schools don't have sufficient enough help for the student, or the teacher could not be doing their job correctly.

On the other hand, middle schools with their own sports programs can do this. If the student has a failing grade, they could be placed on extracurricular probation. But for middle schools without sports programs, such as Cobb County, this would be unfair, because they would be controlling too much of your life outside of school
