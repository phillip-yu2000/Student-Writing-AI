Dear principle,

I believe that Policy two would be better for students and teachers. Policy two states: "Do not allow students to have phones at school at all". I think this would be a good idea because students are too preoccupied with their phones and other electronics to concentrate on other things of importance. If phones are allowed in school, the fact that the phones are supposed to only be used at free time and lunch will not matter. Students that have free time will be on their phones texting other friends that are in class. Teachers may end up taking phones up because their students are not focusing on their work, but are instead playing on their phones. Students not paying attention in class can lead to their grades dropping. This also means that teachers will have to work harder to keep the classes attention.

Policy two will keep students on track, and they will earn even better grades. I also presume that teachers will have less work, without having to have meetings with parents about student's low grades. That is to say that allowing phones at school is a dreadful idea. I think that most adults would agree with me on this topic. Teenagers all over the world are becoming more involved with their phones every day. It would be better to have students focusing on their school work and grades rather than their social life.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
