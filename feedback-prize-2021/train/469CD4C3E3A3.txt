The "Face on Mars" was just a natural landforms. All of the planets have natural land forms. If there really was civilization on mars we would probably already know about it. But contrary to what NASA believes there are were other people who said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by haze.

NASA thinks that it would have been important to tell tax-payers if it were to have been a true alien land mark, but since you did not recieve any information; you can assume it was just a natural landform. If there were to have been a sign of life on that planet (Mars) it would benefit NASA and the whole world would probably know. "The face" is located on the part if Mars called "Cydonia" which according to Jim Garvin "Is not easy to target (paragraph 9)."

Mission controllers are preparing to go back and look again so they can try to prove that NASA is not trying to hide any evidence. It will not be easy. Mostly because we don't pass over the face very often. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, NASA is very sure that "The Face on Mars" is just an illusion and not bona fide evidence of life on Mars. In the future we hope to discover that it really is just a natural landform and not bona fide evidence on Mars. And if it is evidence maybe we can try to find an acient alien civilation.
