Some reasons to join the Cowboys. Joining the Cowboys would bring a change in his life. They were hiring for more people. His friend took the advantage of inviting him. This job would help him get a job in the sea.

When he takes this job it would help him to be smarter in the seas. The results of him taking this job was that he did not need to go in the army, instead they said you keep on doing your job. Luke was luky because they were hiring. Since Don invited him it said, "Luke couldn't say no. he new it was an opportunity of a life time." If Luke wanted to get a sea job when he got older he could say, " I have expireance in the sea."

The way it changed Luke's life was outstaning. Thanks to Don 'Luke's friend" he was able to get this job. Luke new being a cowboy was a tough job, but he took the job anyway.
