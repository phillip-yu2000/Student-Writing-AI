The develepment of driverless cars is a very unique and intresting topic. The driverlass cars would come with many pros,and cons. From making a living off of them to the cities and counties using them to benifit the citizens.

My belief among with many others is that as a country we do not need anymore reasons for us Americans to be lazy. Although I believe that there would be astonishing benifits with the Firefighters/Parametics using this equipment,there should also be limitations. "There cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash." This show that there is obivisly some reliability behind these machines. The should be used for the elderly,wonded vetrans,and emergency response teams. Although they should not be used for just a lazy or overweight person that wants to take the easy way out. In my personal opinion,and assuming it is for the use of a healthy person they should not be allowed. The furthest it should go for the average person is as the car had its own little auto-pilot for long rides and so on.

I would like to further research thses cars before I can give an educated opinion, but from what i have learned from this artice is that I am aginst Driverless cars. It will cause more trouble then helpfullness.
