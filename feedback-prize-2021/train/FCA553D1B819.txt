Have you ever took advice from your friends or people before? Getting advice from people is better than just doing it yourself. I think getting advice from people is good because you can get better information if you are applying for a new job and it will also help you from not making a stupid decision.

Getting advice from people could really help you when it comes to getting a job. You can get all the information from people who work at the place you are trying to go work for. An other reason for getting advice from people is when you have to go to school and take a test and you get advice from your teacher of what it is on and what you have to study. Advice is an other word for choice and when you make a choice you need advice. But at the same way if you donÃÂ´t use advice your choice you make may go down hill. For example iÃÂ´m a new kid that goes to school at matoaca and I just started and I dont know where any of my classes are I would go to the office and ask for advice so I can know where to go.

Back to when I said that when you donÃÂ´t get any advice your choice after that could be very bad. You could possible get hurt if you donÃÂ´t get the advice for the situation your in. For example you go with your friends sky diving and if you dont take any advice when you go you could die.

If you get advice that you really dont trust or you dont feel comfortable with, than dont do it see what other people say. But advice that you trust you dont have to worry about making stupid decisions or not having to get hurt.

At the end of the day I feel like getting advice van really help you. But not getting good advice stay away from because it could not end well. So when ever you are in a situation when you need to get advice get it from someone that you trust. Like a teacher parent or any adult.
