I think studing venus is a good idea becuase there a proboly a lot of new thing to descover on venus. Venus is the cloest planet to earth in the terms of density and size. Even tho each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more then a few hours, and it will still be a good risk for a new life. Not a single spaceship has touchdown on venus in more then three decades. I think studying venus is a good idea because the spaceship that was up there never made it back and one day sombody will. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 precent carbon dioxide blankets venus. the clouds are even more challenging (of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere). Venus has the hottest surface temerature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venus is almost's earth twin but it is just hard to get there and take a long time. There are alot of things that people haven't found yet but are geting closer to finding, it's up to them to bring it back. they are still tring new ways to study venus. for example, (some simplified simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition). They are trying many different ways to study venus, they are looking back toan old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during the world war 2. I think that they should still study venus becaus it is a lot of thing that haven't found yet.
