Would you let students read eachothers emotions in a classroom? I will be addressing why this may be valuble to students, or even to the whole school and why it may not be valuble.

The first thing i want to talk about is how it can be benificial to the Students. What if your close friend or even a teacher isn't acting their usual self. You can't quite figure out what the cause may be with them. And instead of asking, you could see what their emotion is through technology. If it shows up that they're sad you can figure out a way to encourage them to talk about whats going on. Or you can just figure out a way to cheer them up with out knowing their personal life. Or you could see if the person is just plain tired. So checking their emotions can also help you to understand that it may not even be you. They may be exhausted after a long day. So then you learn not to take things so personal.

A reason it may not be Valuble is people just need privacy. Maybe someone is upset over something personal that has happened in their life. I feel like if you do use the techology on the wrong person, it could set them off and lead them to being more irritable. Some people like to handle their emotions in different ways. Even if that means doing it in peace with no interuptions.

In conclusion, I feel that it depends on the situation in a school or town. It depends if you actually know the person, or if the person likes to be left alone or not. Everyone deserves privacy. So if schools were to do so, I suggest getting contracts to see who would be up for it and who wouldn't
