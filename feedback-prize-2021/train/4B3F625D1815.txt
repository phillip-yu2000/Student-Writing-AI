To the Principal,

Our school should not ban cell phones. Cell phones are important to the safety of many students and is also a source of communication for students and their parents. There are many uses for cell phones other than to talk to friends.

One of these reasons is that if parents give a cell phone to a student it is probably because they need them to have it. If a student has to walk home alone it will reassure their parents if they know that they have a cell phone and they can communicate with them. If something important happens at a students home and the parents need to tell the student about it they can either call them at lunch or text them.

Another reason is that many students don't feel comfortable going to a teacher or other adults at school and telling them that they feel sick or something is wrong. Cell phones allow them to tell there parents directly and makes them more comfortable.

Some people may argue that there are phones at school that the students can use and that they should have their parents pick them up instead of walking home. They also may say that cell phones are a distraction in class.

Although these are good reasons, I think that it is a lot more difficult for a student to go up to a teacher and ask them to use the phone than to just call their parents on their own phone. Many teachers and nurses will ask a lot of questions about why they need to call and things like that and it makes students very uncomfortable to have to answer these questions. Also, many students have to walk home because their parents work or have to go somewhere.

As you can see, cell phones make students and parents feel comfortable and happy. They give students a way so communicate with their parents without being questioned by teachers.
