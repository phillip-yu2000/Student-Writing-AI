Should cell phones be allowed at school? Many people such as adults don't think so. Maybe they just shouldn't be privileged at school. Perhaps only during free periods of time.

I believe that cell phones should be allowed during school hours. I think this, because at least we're able to have ours on campus. Using our phones outside of class, and only during free time is a good idea. My reason for that is, "why use them during class?" if you can have your phone at school and not during class hours," who else will be using them during class?" "NOBODY" and that's a good thing you won't feel left out!

Having your phone during school is better than not having them at all. I'd rather be able to have it at least then at all. Beside what can you have you use your phone for anyways to ask how their class is going? Having my cell phone during free time is better because you would actually need it. Perhaps to ask a friend where they're at or to borrow some money, or maybe if they need a ride home from school? Any who, I think the first policy would work out great for schools now a day!
