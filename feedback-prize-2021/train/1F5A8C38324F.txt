I think that helping the community is important but I believe that it might interfere with other things that you need to do, like having a part-time job or schoolwork. So I think that performing community work could get in the way of other things that you need or want to do.

Performing community work is great and all, but what if some students have things to do or want to do but they cant because they have to help with community services? What if they have a part-time job that they must attend to or babysit their little siblings or even the neighbors kids? What if someone has to do a school project that could take hours to do and its due the next day? What im getting at is that people have things that they must do in life, and might not always be able to help with the community work. Helping out is great and all but people have lives outside of school and might not always be there to help with the community work.

So where I stand is that im against students doing community work, for they might have some things that might have to attend to first. Its not always easy to commit to something that you might not be able to follow through with, so this why I am against it.
