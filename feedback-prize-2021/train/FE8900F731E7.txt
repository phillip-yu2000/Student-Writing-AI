Dear Principal,

I don't agree that you should change school policy so that students may or may not participate in sports unless that have a grade B average. I disagree because some other students struggle in getting a B for an average even if you or your not doing it for sports or other activities. A lot of students on participated with sports or activities have a C average and this will decrease the number of kids who want to play sports or try different activities. i think the grade C average was a lot better because it gave some kids a chance to try and get a better grade to allow them to play sports. If you change the policy a lot of kids might give up trying to get a B average and therefore wouldn't be able to play any sports or activities. If there is an excellent player on a team they will have to really try on their test to get a least a B and if they get below that they get kicked off the team and it couldn't be fair to them or anybody. i don't think that this is a good idea to change the average to a B along with other students who attend sports.

Sincerely,

Students
