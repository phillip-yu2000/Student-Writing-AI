I believe that schools should offer distance learning because it would benifical for students that health issues and will let students work in their own pace.

Students that have both health and phisical problems causes them to miss classes frequently and they are way behind in school work. With online school this would benifit them a lot rather then going back to schoool with all these incomplete work, so with online schools they can do the work at home the days they missed school. I have a friend and she is germafobic. Germafobic is when u don't like sharing, or touching stuff that aren't sanatiezed becuase they are too afriad of germs. This causes her too miss a lot of school days. This is just one reason why schools should offer distance learning.

There are some students that are fast learners and some that are slow learners. with students that are fast learners they have to wait till everyone knows what their doing in class. Students that slow might have a chance in falling behind in classes. With online schools this will give students a chance to go ahead of class or it will catch them up in class. This is another reason why schools should let students take online classes.

Students may need guiedece or may help with a problem they might not know. There are students that have time struggling with a problem and without a teacher around they might not be able to solve it. Without an adults supervision students might copy another person work and this will lead to plagerisim. With students plagerising, this may cause them to get suspended from school or gets them expelled.

This is why i think schools should offer us long distance learning so we can work on our own pace and for students that have physical problems.
