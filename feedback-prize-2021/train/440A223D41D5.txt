Leonardo De Vincis famous painting is the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is known all over the world today. There has been many of debates about weather she is smiling or if she has any eyebrows. It took Leo to paint the hands 4 years alone.

Today Thomas Huang has now made an invention. Huang has came up with a technology called Facial Action Coding System which is where computers can caculate up the real emotions of a student or person. Studies show that this technology system can read all your emotions you're feeling. It can tell if you're sad,happy,angry and lots more of emotions. Huang states in the text that they tell your emotions by the muscles on your face.

Huang also goes on saying that he can pin point out emotins on kids in school. In my defence I dont this this would work accuratley. Not only do i think it would work. Many of teacher would not want to get out that device in the middle of class just to see your kids emotions. Many of kids fake smile or act like they are happy when really they are not. Studies show that they are identified by the muscles but you could easlily get told to smile which changed your muscles which changed the game.

Many of student come to school depressed or upset. Many of teacher do not know if they are really happy or not. This technology I feel would not be valuable because maybe the student do not want people to know there emotions. Emotions should be kept private and with this technology it would be open to everyone in a classroom.

Overall I feel like this would not benifit anything. I also feel like this would not be valuable to students in classrooms. Therefore This technology may help on paints. One example is the Mona Lisa but not on humans because this could lead to not there real emotions.
