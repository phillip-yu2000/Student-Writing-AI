Dear Ms. principal

My name is STUDENT_NAME and

I am with you on changing the school policy. I feel that it is fair that a student must obtain a B average to play in sports or other activities. Most things in sports whether your trying to make a career out of playing sports, comes down to what your grade is. Playing a sport or attending activities is more like a privilege that you have to work for to get. Changing the school policy is actually a real good idea because most students really want to play sports or attend activities and changing the policy to having a B average will get students to succeed in changing their grade to attend these things and even more successful in class. Most students don't want to be lazy and most students feel a passion for the sport or activity that they do or attend , so if playing a sport or attending activities means that they have to try hard, perceiver to try and bump up their grade even higher then that's what the students will do. Thank you for your time

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
