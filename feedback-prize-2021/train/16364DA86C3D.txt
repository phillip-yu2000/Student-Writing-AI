I believe that the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is sort of valuable. It can either help someone or not. But it doesn't hurt to try.

To begin with,

I say sort off because, for one, you never know what a person is going through. If the computer can tell someones emotion why not see how they're feeling. If they're sad or depressed maybe you can help them in someway. But also, people might not want you to know how they're feeling. So using the computer's app, that is kind of disrespecting them in a way because they dont want you to know their emotions.

Also, I still think it is valuable because like a I said if they're sad you can help them. Even if they don't want you to know, you can still help them secretly though. They will recieve help without even knowing that they're getting help. Little do people know, alotof people who are sad tend to smile the most and just look happy. So, honestly i do feel like it is very valuable, people should use it. But not just anyone, maybe like doctors or specialist.

I think specialists should be the ones to use them because they can be the ones to help people and they actually know how to do so. In the passage it talks about how in some people it is easy to tell by their face expression what they are feeling. But sometimes it is hard, and i agree. That is why I do think it is very valuable to use the computer.

Lastly, I do think its useable. It helps by letting us know who is depressed or stuff like that. But like I had said, I belive it should only be doctors using it and not just anyone because people and kids are immature and we would not want others to make them feel worse.
