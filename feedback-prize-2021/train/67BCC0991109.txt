Most people would say that driveless cars are a pretty good idea. But I don't believe it is. Most people would get in accidents more often.

The reason why I say dirveless cars are not the smartest idea is because if you have driveless cars everywhere there would be a higher chance of getting into an acccident than just you driving the car. This would likely happen because what happens if the system malfunctions on you and you are just there driving not knowing that the system isn't working, and then before you know BANG you hit another car.

Now, some people are saying "well in the article it says that you need to be aware of you enviroment" which in other words you need to know what is going on outside of your car. But, lets be real most people now and days don't really look at the road. They are texting or doing something while not looking on the road. So, what I am trying to say is driveless cars are not woth the wait nor the money. Most people in this world will probably be doing the same exact thing when you are the one drive the car.

So, some of us can be clear to most of you guys. That driverless cars are not woth it and that most if not all of us will be doing the samething as before and nothing will change.
