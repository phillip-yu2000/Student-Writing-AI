I Luke think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join because it is a chance of a life time. Also you will be able to see new things like Europe, China, and Venice, Italy. You could also see an excavated castle in Crete and you can see the Panama Canal.

For those of you out there who love riding boats or want to ride one, this is the perfect program for you. You can bee on a boat for the longest of a month at a time just going to a place like China.

Also if you love helping for comunity service or helping others this is perfect because you can have fun and help others while in this program. The other cowboys and I played a lot of fun games while abord the boat like baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals had been held. We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other activities to help pass time.

My final reason you should join this program is if you love animals this this is the at most best program to join. This is true because you are always near the animals you get to feed them and pet them and even talk to them you know if you like things like that. They also start to seem like your own pets. Just I just want to tell you do not name them. If you name them then you will get to detached and will be really sad when you have to give them up. Trust me I named my favorite horse and it was so hard for me to leave Betsey in China. I hope you will be joining us in this program soon.
