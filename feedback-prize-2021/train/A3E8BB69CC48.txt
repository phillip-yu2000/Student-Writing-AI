Dear Principal,

Cell phones should be use lunch periods and other free times because if the kids use their cell phones at free periods they'll not use their phones during class. They will know that the only time they can use them is at free time. Also they are more likely listen in class and actully learn something.

Cell phones are fun so I guess that's why kids use them so much. Not all kids use cell phones to text or talk with their friends. Some kids use it for important things like if someone forgot their money at home and they couldn't eat cause they had no money. They would use their cell phone to call home and get the money ,but they call at free time. Not in class which if they did they would learn anything cause they were try to call during class and not after.

There are other ways to use cell phones like you can use it for information for a project or an important book report. You can also use they to find something your not sure of
