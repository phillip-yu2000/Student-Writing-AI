Dear Principal,

I am responding to a policy about having cell phones at/in school. To me I say that Policy 1 is a good choice to make but not so much because, If students didn't properly take this time as an advantage to use their cell phones it could lead to bigger problems and then adventually could lead to the whole school not having them at all like Policy 2 proceeds to do. If there was no problem with having cell phones at school then it wouldn't to bad having them, like how students have gotten in trouble in the past for using a cell phone during school.

Policy 2 doesn't allow cell phones at all during school hours for students to use or make important phone calls with which is not a bad idea to follow because then and only then students wouldn't take the chance of getting into trouble, getting it taken away, or having it get lost for a certain reason. It should also give students a little of free time to socialize outside of the school with a parent or family member about a ride home or anything outside school time.
