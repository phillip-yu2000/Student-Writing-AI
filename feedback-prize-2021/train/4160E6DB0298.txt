Dear Principle,

Making students not participate in sports or another activities unless they have a grade B average isn't fair for many reasons. First of all, many students have a grade C average. Which is saying that it's difficult to keep a grade B average. Many students wouldn't be participating in sports or other activities. For those of the students that are maintaining a grade B average or higher that would want to be in sports probably wouldn't be able to because there aren't many, so there wouldn't be enough to have a team. The school would be missing out on so much if you did this.

Grades are important but many students don't want to only focus on school work, it makes them stressed. Keeping a grade B average is a hard task for students and keeping them out of sports and after school activities that they enjoy is not completely fair. Having after school activities or sports gets their mind of school. Students make more friends with after school activities which helps them enjoy school more and want to go.

I think the new school policy that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is not a good policy, as you can see. I think it would be a better idea to make it a grade C average, since most of the students are maintaining one.
