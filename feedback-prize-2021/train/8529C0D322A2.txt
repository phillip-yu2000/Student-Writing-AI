There has always been a debate on how we should electe our president. There always will be. Someone always has a new idea or plan for the future. After giving it quite some thought I have come to the conclution that changing to eletion by popular vote is the best way to elect our predent. Not only if it the most effcient way but its also the most fair way. I belive this for many reasons and I hope you can see that this is the path to sucess.

One out of the vasriety of resons why we should not keep the electoral college and change it to election by popular vote is that electoral college is unfair. Its unfair because of the winner take all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chnce of winning. A perfect example of the flaw is during the 2000 campain, seventeen staes didnt see canates at all. Its unfair outdated and irrational and we need to do something about it now.

Also the electoral college can cause the disater factor. The american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisist. The system is going to cause problems and it needs to be removed as soon as posiable. If we keep going at this rate we will end up with a disater so big that wont be fixable. The election by popular vote can fix this. Its a fair and equal system that peope will agree with. It allows them to have a say in the election. They feel herd, dont you want to make the people happy.

As you can see clearly the option of election of popular vote is the only way to fix this madness. These are just a few of the thousands of reasons why we need the change. the system we have now is going to crash and burn and there will be no recover. i know you know what is right so make the change that will put us on top. Not only do we want this we need this. i hope you can see that senator. I cant articulate how drasticly is will improve the election process. thankyou for your time and have a nice day.
