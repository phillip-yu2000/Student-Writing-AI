Dear Principal,

I believe the better policy is policy #1. I think that because students would like a chance to use their cell phones during the day. I think its better because if students have time to use there cell phone during the time given, they won't be using them in classes during class time.

If students were not to have the time given during school hours they would be doing it all day trying to get whatever it is they need done on their cell phone without the teacher seeing them and then they wouldn't be paying enough attention in class to understand whatever it is they are learning.

If the school was to have time for the students to use their cell phones the teachers wouldn't have to watch for the students who use them in the classroom. Teachers are always trying to make students understand their learning better, so if there was to be no cell phones in school there would be a lot more not paying attention. That is why I think cell phones should be allowed, at certain times of the day, in school. That is why I

picked policy 1.
