Dear Mr. Principle,

I think it's awesome that you want all the students to do community service and I would love if everyone did, but i just don't think it's going to work. A lot of people are going to want to spend their weekends resting from a hard and stressful week instead of doing community service. It would be great if we had the time and energy to do it, but unfortunately, we do not. Even if you do make it a rule, it may not go very well. There will always be someone who rebels or some people might not even show up. Many people may not work very hard. Why would you want to waste someone's time with a person who doesn't even want to be there? They wouldn't be much help.

Instead of forcing students to do community service, I think you would be more successful if you gave the students some sort of reward. If they had an incentive or reason to be doing what they're are doing, they will work harder and more people will sign up. Although, there are the students who want to help out the community and they probably will regardless of if there is a reward or not. You might want to acknowledge them for their kindness and generosity. Maybe people will see that and think they could be and do something great too.

Thank you for reading my letter. I hope it's obvious to see where I stand in this. Please take my ideas into consideration.
