Did you know the face on mars is and always has been a natural land formation and nothing more so. Even though people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars it is actualy a Butte, land forms that are common in american west. The face on mars is not eny type of ancent martion civalization land mark and has been proven, by NASA, to be a natural land formation.

The face on mars is thing more but a land formtion known as butte. In April 5, 1998 Global Surveyor took pictures of the Face and had raviled a natural land formation. thn again in April 8, 2001 an even more clearer shot af the face was taken again for to prove it was only a land formation and was then proven to a butte, land formations that are coomon in the American West.

People that belive that the face is profe of a national land mark are only seeing what they belive from films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. normaly these people don't have the means to acually inspect the face and aren't acual scientist and astronimasts that make a living from studying it. Don't take the fact from a person how only talks about what he wants it to but a person who atualy knows what they are talking about.

The face has been proven to be a natural land formation in 199, but people still belive it's an anchent martion civalization. The picture that was taken in 1998 was taken on a foggy day on mars so people still think it could be a profe to life on mars. In 2001 another picture that was not fogged was tooken and put an end to the entire fuss.

Take the facts from the people that studyed the face and don't listen to thoughs who don't know what they are talking about. The face is and always has been a butte.
