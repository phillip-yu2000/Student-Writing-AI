Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know you are currently deciding whether or not to change the school policy from having a grade C average for being able to participate in sports or other activities, to having a grade B average. This will not be the better choice. Many students now are even struggling to get a grade C average. Changing the policy to a grade B average will hopefully improve grades in these student who wish to play sports at school, or any other activities. But it is still a bad idea. Changing this policy may decrease the number of players on the teams.

I know that all principles want their students to represent there school in a good manner. This leads to public school games, such as football and basketball. If students on teams can't at least get a B average, this will lead to less players that are playing. As the number decreases, this may lead to an automatic loss because there are not enough players to participate. This would be a real shame if it happened all because of the decision of changing the school policy. I have seen this before at my old school, and how it effected the school. In order to keep a stable amount of players, i notify you not to change the policy. Even if students aren't on teams, this is still a big struggle. Yes it means working harder than usual, but some students have other things to do after school besides trying to bring there grades up with hours of studying and doing homework every night. If you do take the chance of changing the school policy, it can effect many with other things to do in there free time while not at school.

However, this is the decision i would take of not changing the policy. The only good it will do is bring grades up for those students who aren't as busy as some other people may be. Don't you want to see improvement in ALL of your students? I hope you do.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
