Most schools require students to do extra learning projects during the summer. Although, this may sound uninteresting to most students, it can help. Whether it's an essay or fun project, students should want to show teachers how much they've learned during the school year and still remember while on summer break. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it helps students focus on important topics they need to know and it prepares students for future classes.

One important reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because it helps students focus on the more important topics. Teachers can see if you have any weaknesses on the subjects you need to remember the most and he/she can help you improve in that catagory. Also, students may do their project on things totally off topic from what was taught in class if they design it themselves. These teacher-designed projects may also help you learn even more about the things you've learned. Extra learning on things you're already skilled in only makes you better.

Also, these projects prepare students for future classes. Future teachers can see their students' work ethic and how well they complete their work just by looking at their summer project. It can also give students an head-start in their class by going over new things while completing the summer assignment provided by their previous teacher. Doing assignments over the summer may also boost your grade up. Students can walk into their new class already having an "A+" because they did a great job on their project!

Projects that teachers give you aren't to make you do extra work you don't need, they're there to help you. Doing assigments can improve your grades and strengthen your knowledge.
