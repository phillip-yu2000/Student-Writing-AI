Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hi. My name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student at SCHOOL_NAME and I am part of the Student Body Council. I have a strong opinion on the two policies that you have asked the Student Body Council to deliberate on and give you our opinions. I believe that Policy 1, Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, is the best choice. Now let me tell you why.

First of all, if you choose Policy 2, Do not allow students to have phones at school at all, is the worst option, I believe. I have done research and according to Psychologist OTHER_NAME, ninety percent of schools that do not allow phones at school have unhappy children which eventually affects their behavior and their attitude toward other kids, teachers, and administrators.

If a student has to go to after school because he has to make up a test, that student would have to call his parents. If you do not allow phones at school he cannot call his parents which can eventually result in him getting grounded because his parents didn't know that he had to stay after school and were extremely worried about him. It could also result in him walking home which is a huge risk because he could get hit by a car or kidnapped.

I agree with Policy 1 because if students abide by that policy than there would be no reason to take the phones away. Of course if a student doesn't abide by the policy, he or she should get his or her phone taken away and his or her parents would have to pick it up from the school.

I hope you listen to my opinion about this matter because it is not fair if we don't get to use the right to use our phones, when we already have that right. Please listen, think, and discuss with other students about what policy they think should be enforced.

All for the best,

STUDENT_NAME
