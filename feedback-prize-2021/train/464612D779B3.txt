dear, TEACHER_NAME

I believe that this is not a fair rule because not everyone is naturally smart like others they might have a tougher time passing. This could make it tough to maintain a B average as well as staying focused on school. If the grade limit is this high kids might loose focus during sports. If the grade is to low kids wont focus enough and fall behind in their studies. This is why i believe that a C average is good because it is a neutral grade meaning that its not to low or high. If we can keep it at C average i also believe that lather than stay at a bare minimum. all in all this statement of raising grades is an important topic that could affect the future of many children's futures . I just believe that C average is the best answer to the problem that is at hand.

Sincerely,
