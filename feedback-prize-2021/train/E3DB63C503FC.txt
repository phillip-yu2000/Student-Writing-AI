Why does a person ask multiple people when seeking for advise? When people ask for advise, they sometimes talk to more than one person. There are many advantages for asking multiple people when seeking for advise. Asking multiple people can help a person make a better choice because it helps him or her understand the better options and different possibilities when solving a problem.

Having better options can help a person make a better choice. For example, high school students can ask their teachers or parent about what college to attend. Their parents and teacher might have different opinions on different colleges. As parents, they might want their children to find a college thats closer to them and teachers might give options that relates to the students' high school courses. The high school student can listen to their advises and better decide which college to attend.

People's minds think differently. If a person ask more than one person with a math problem, they might have different ways to solve the problem. It helps the person see the different possibilities of ways to solve the problem. The person can understand the different ways and see which is best for them so that next time they can use that method to find the best answer.
