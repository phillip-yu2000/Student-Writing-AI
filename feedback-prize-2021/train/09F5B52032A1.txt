Driverless cars may be coming, but that does not mean they should come. Todays society may encourage the use of driverless cars, but in reality it is not safe, it is not one hundered percent driverless, and it will cause many people to lose their jobs. Driverless cars may seem "cool" to many people, but people need to think about the huge disadvanteges.

The first disadvantage is driverless cars are not safe. Driverless cars have sensors that are supposed to detect and respond to danger. Suppose while the driverless car is turning, one of the sensors does not pick up another car. the driverless car will turn anyway becuase it does not know better, and the cars will crash.

Many people may say one advatage to driverless cars would be not having to to pay attention to the road, and getting to sleep, text, or watch movies instead. Although doing these things would be nice it is not possible with driverless cars. Driverless cars still require the "driver" to stay alert incase something happens.

Finally, having driverless cars will cause mant people to lose their jod. Taxi drivers, school bus drivers, and semi drivers would no longer be needed. All these people will be unemployed because of a computer driven car.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be amazing, but they are not safe, not one hundred percent driverless, and they will cause many people to lose their jobs. These disadvantages may seem small, but in reality they are very important. Many people in todays society may be fascinated with driverless cars but that does not mean they should be used.
