Dear Principal,

I don't think it's fair to make students have a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. Many students that have a C average might need sports or other activities to feel good about themselves. Some students use sports to get healthier and make new friends. If they have C average grades they might be trying really hard, but some are too shy to ask questions, and sports can help them make new friends so they can talk more. That might raise there grades but if they can't play sports in the first place there grades might go down instead of up.

Some kids are only good at a couple things. One of those things might be Band, Art, Cooking, Sewing, or Chess, or

Basketball, or even reading. If you take those things away from them because of there grades they will feel like there not good at anything. For example if a C average kid wants to join band because music is his favorite thing in the world, and he wants to be a musician when he grows up, he won't have the right amount of experience to achieve his goals because he had average grades.

Another reason you shouldn't make kids have a B average is because nobody is perfect all the time. They might have a good A average year and then drop to a C average another year. Then because they couldn't enjoy there favorite activities last time, their grades will go down more because they don't have enough experience to make the team, which will make them feel bad about themselves and not want to try to get there grades up anymore. They don't get there grades up because they don't care about making the team so they don't care anymore. Their only good part of school every day is sports or other activities that they do. That's why it's important to let them join even if there grades are not perfect.
