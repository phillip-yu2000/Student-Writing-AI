Should schools enforce that students will have to participate in extracurricular activities? I strongly agree for students having to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For this reason, principals should require that all students should participate in one extracurricular activity. Principals should enforce this because it builds character, it brings a good reputation, and helps students make more friends.

Character, its an important aspect most people dont pay attention to. However, it makes an impact in daily life in various ways. Thats just one of the many benefits you get if you participate in extracurricular activities. Character can change in a person and thats why they should participate in extracurricular activities. It can be as little act such as a kind word that can build character and makes someones day.

In addition you can acquire a good reputation by participating in extracurricular activities. Also many people will begin to trust you. For instance, I have a good reputation with my class and won the supralitiveÂ most dependable. having a good reputation is also beneficial in life because people can talk to you about how they feel. That in my book is the best feeling in the world,

Making friends its something everybody should try to do everyday. Students will be able to do just that if they attend a extracurricular activity. Students will do so while attending extracurricular activities. In addition students will see other students more making a closer bond. So be the social butterfly whenever you can.

In summary, Principals should require students to attend at least one extracurricular activity. They should enforce this because it builds character, it brings a good reputation, and help students make more friends. So next time be on the lookout for the next chance to participate in extracurricular activities.
