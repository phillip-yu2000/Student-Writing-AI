The "face" on mars is a natural landform and was not made by aliens. I know this because it's just a rock formation. The second reason is NASA would want there to be life on mars because it would benefit them. Finally because the shadows give the appearance of looking like a face.

My first reason is it's just a rock formation. In the artcle, it says global surveyor flew over Cydonia and snap photos of it. These pictures were 10 times sharper than the original. Also these showed that it was just a natural landform. It is the mar equivalent of a butte or Mesa.

Now I know what some of you are thinking, "What if NASA is hiding something. Well my next reason is NASA would benefit by finding aliens on mars. In the text it said that while defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an alien civillzation. This shows that they would embrace having found aliens because they could make money. NASA wouldn't be hiding anything because they would be missing out. In the text it even said that authors resoned it would be a good way to engage the public an attract more attention to mars.

Finally, the face only lookes like that because of shadows. The article says the face only comes from shadows. It gave the illusion of having eyes, a mouth, and a nose. People have traveled as far as we could get; with the best camera and saw that it was just a normal rock formation. In face we have many of these same mesa and butte on earth.

The face on mars is is a natural landform and was not made by aliens. This is because it's just a normal rock formation. The next reason is NASA would want there to be life on Mars because it would beneft them. Finally, The "face" is formed because of the shadows on the Mesa. For all these reasons the face on mars was not made by aliens, but is just a regular rock formation
