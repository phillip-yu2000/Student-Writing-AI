Do you ever struggleÂ to make a choice between something like, whether or not you should study for a test or bring an umbrella to the store. Even choices as simple as that you can make the wrong choice. So should you ask for advice from multiple people, absolutely. asking for help is not a bad thing and you learn more when you ask.

when making a choice you have your opinion and you might think this is the right choice but you are not 100%, so what do you do. well you don't go cry in your room, you have to investigate. You don't always have to ask people, sometimes you can find your answer online or in a book, but the easiest way to find the right choice is to ask a person that is alive. ask them the question, "should I study for this minor test" someone might say "yes always study" and others might say "no its a small test there is no point". then what you do is find out who said more of one choice and think about it for a period of time depending on how big the question was, then go with your best choice and hopefully it's the right one.

to ensure that you don't make a stupid choice like what collage you should attend, do exactly what this essay is about ask people and they will tell you more information and will make you see things in a different way so you don't make a bad decision. overall I feel like it is smart to ask and think about your choice rather than just making one quickly and making a bad one.
