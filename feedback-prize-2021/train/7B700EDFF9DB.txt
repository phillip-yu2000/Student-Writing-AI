What would happen if someone was in a driverless car and it got into an accident and the person got hurt? If the person was driving they may have been able to prevent the accident and avoided getting hurt. Because of these possible accidents and mistakes that the driverless cars could make it is not a good idea to have them. Yes, there are times when they would come in handy. Say someone woke up late and did not have time to get ready. If there were driverless cars that person could get ready while the car was driving itself. Although times like these may come in handy it is still not a good idea to have them around.

In the reading it says that sometimes the car gets into situations when it does not know what to do, such as traffic and construction zones. If this were to happen the person would need to take control of the car and go along as if it was not even a driverless car. This seems to defeat the whole purpose of having a driverless car. So why have them when in reality it is not completely a driverless car.

There will never be a time when we can fully rely on the safety of a driverless car. Yes, they may know the rules of the road, but they do not know what to do in all situations. Because people cannot fully rely on these cars, it will cause them to worry, and will constantly be looking at the road and what is going on becuase they do not know if the car will know what to do. This situation also defeats the purpose of having a driverless car because it will be like they are driving, but with more anxiety.

Due to all of these reasons for possible crashes and causing stress and anxiety to the passengers it is not a good idea to have driverless cars around. Even though at times they might come in handy, there is always a downside that goes along with that. In this case there are just to many downsides to make it worth the time of fixing and improving the driverless cars to run properly.
