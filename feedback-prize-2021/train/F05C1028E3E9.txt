Many students love sports, but getting good grades is essential to be successful in life.

There are many reasons why the choice to switch the requirement to a B is necessary because kids will have to focus in school and not on sports to be able to play.

The reason that so many kids have C averages is because they do not care about their school work and grades, as long as they get to play video games or sports.

The sports kids are the ones who do not realize how important jobs are to families and survival. If a kid keeps on getting C averages, they may get D averages which will most likely decrease to F averages. In order to go to college, one must have 23 high school credits, 12 in which are from math, language arts, and science.

School is one of the most important aspects of life, and in order to succeed and do sports, these kids will have to put on their thinking caps and mature up, and they will end up thanking us later in life for ensuring they had good grades.

Good grades can almost ensure people a meritorious career, and they will have good lives for their families and have good shelter.

The kids with C averages don't strive very hard because their lives revolve around sports.

The kids all have lives outside of school, and think that school is a waste of time in the way of their video games and sports.

They will end up failing in life if they do not succeed in their education, and that means they will most likely have health problems and an premature death.

So, you are making an excellent decision by switching the requirement from C average to B average because it will help students have better futures.

They also will feel proud of themselves for using the time wisely, since there is no second chance.
