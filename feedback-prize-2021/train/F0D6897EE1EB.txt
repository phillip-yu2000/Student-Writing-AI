Can you imagine a time in future with driverless cars? Recently, I was introduced to an article named "Driverless Cars are Coming". Since 2009, Google has been working on cars that are semi-autonomous. Apparenlty, the cars are able to drive themselves for more than half a million miles without a crash. Although, the Google cars are not truly driverless. I belive that the development of these cars should be stopped immeditately.

Everyone knows that the automobile has been around for years now. People depend on their cars to take them from point A to B all around the world. Since the autonomous cars are not even completely liable, why should we trust them? In paragraph 2, the text states that they can not navigate through roadwork accidents. Therefore, they'll need the driver to take over. Worst case scenario: the driver isn't paying attention.

So, say that these cars are ran by GPS. If not, how else would the cars be ran? Where I come from, there are many drop zones. What if the car loses signal and completely malfunctions? At least, with a normal automobile, you can attempt to navigate yourself to the proper destination.

In conclusion, I believe that autonomous cars should not be developed. I say if you can control something manually, go for it. Our world today already depends on technology too much! Technology can only run so far. Putting my life into some computer-generated hands isn't exactly on my to-do list. Some things, in my opinion, should just be left to us humans.
