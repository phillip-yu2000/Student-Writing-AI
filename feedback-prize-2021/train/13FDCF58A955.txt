I currently don't really like doing school online. The main reason i don't like schools online is because i used to do it myself. I didn't really learn form doing school online. One of the main reasons why i was doing school online was because my parents didn't like public schools. So for that being said other student might like it but me personally i don't.

School online may help others then going to actual school. Maybe the person is going through something in school. Doing school at home my be easier for some students,

they probably learn quicker and probably finish school faster. Others may not work that way, some maybe work slower in school, so they wanna work at their own paste . Others may just wanna tryout school at home.

On the other note it's good for schools to do that. If some students were going on a trip they could easily do school on the road. I would help them stay on track with the class. or maybe the student did something bad in school that it would lead them to do school at home. Oh and if a student gets sick to the point to where he can't come to school ,and it was something bad they would do school at home.

To be completely honest i don't like this idea at all. It's because i did it for a good old 3 years, and it was a bad experience for me. I wouldn't remand it, but if you where going through somethings then yeah go for it. I like public school better then doing school online because i like to ask questions and see it myself in person. That's all i had to say, i'm not a fan of doing school online.
