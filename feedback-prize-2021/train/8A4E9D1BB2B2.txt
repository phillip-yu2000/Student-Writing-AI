TEACHER_NAME:

I believe that every student should have to perform some type of community service because we should all give back to the community in one way or another or another, even if its just helping someone in their yard or going to a nursing home and sitting with the elderly just for them to have company.

We should perform community service so we can be prepared and ready for the world of work.

It would also be a good experience for us to help out in the community just to see what is going on in and around the community.

Community service would be a great idea because we could learn a lot about the people in our community and get to know them in a friendly and personal way.

It may take up lot of our spare time but I believe that it is worth it.

Community service is a great service to have on any applications for college and even when we are searching for a job after college.

Most businesses now hire workers that have experience and who have done community service. Also, we would become well respected and trusted if we have helped out and donated our time to help out around and in the community.

Helping out in the community would be a great thing for students who want to go to college and who want to achieve a decent , nice paying job in the future.

Also, it is good to start students this young helping out in the community because they will turn out to be well respected young adults in the future.
