Theres lots of reasons why you should join the program but i'm going to give you the best reasons. As you can see from the artical/passage you can tell that Luke was helping animalsover seas from WWII. The text states, "UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of: The horses, young cows and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up."

That was just the first reason and if you don't understand it i was trying to say you could help ship and save many animals lives. Now the next reason that might change your mind and help you began to slowly realise that you should join is going to different places. In the artical is states that Luke actually went to greece when he turned the age of 18. Which he even had free time on his hand and had fun doing his job

There is also fun on the ship when the animals get off and you have a little bit of time to play around. The author states, "Luke also found time to have fun on board (When the animals got off the ship of course) the cowboys played baseball and volleyball and such."

Now this job is not as easy as it seems and it can be dangerous, as you can clearly see that the text states, "Luke was on night watch and slide on something, luckily he did not fall in to the atlantic but he still could not work do to the broken ribs." As you can see its not that easy and can be dangerous if you're not careful and check your surroundings.

But by the end its all worth is, im sure luke felt good about himself once the job was finished and done. Touring around different citys, helping feed animals. Its amazing and something new and those are just some of the reasons why you should join the program and if you do good luck and have fun seeing different parts of the world
