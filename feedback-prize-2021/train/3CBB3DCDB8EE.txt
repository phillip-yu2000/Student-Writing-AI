I think the technology for the facial action coding system is a good idea beause the computer will be able to tell your emotion and see weather your happy or not. It can tell emotion from celebrity's and how they are feeling. It can also determan if someone is fake smiling or not just by the muscles in there face. the computer can tell 6 diffrent moods you might be in, happy, sad, angry, fear, disgust and surprised.

The articles says "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles". That is telling you how the computer would be able to detect your emotions. The article also says "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal". Meaning if you are happy and act like you are sad it can still tell that your happy.

The new computer technology can even identify mixed emomtions as well. The article claims that "each expression is compared against a neutral face", meaning showing no emotion. Therefore you can tell how someone you know is feeling with the new technolgy. Its all about the muscular units in your face that tells it all.

That is why i think that the new technology called facial Action Coding System is a good idea. it is something fun to do and help figure out what people are feeling. To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.
