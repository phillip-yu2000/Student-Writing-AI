Dear Principal,

I send you this letter to let you know about the arguing that has been going on our school whether students should be required to perform community service or not. Well my opinion is that performing community should be an optional, however I think teachers should encourage students to do it. Teachers can encourage students by offering rewards such as extra-credits.

I believe this method would work on students,

this way students can do better on school and help their community, all at the same time. If we were to require them, those students that say to not have time would feel as if they were obligated to work for something that does not benefit them. On the other hand if we didn't encourage them, they simply wouldn't do it.

With the help of teachers, students and parent we can all make of our community a better place to live, and make of ourselves a better person.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
