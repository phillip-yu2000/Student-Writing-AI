I'm a hands on type of guy so, i'll disagree with the Driverless car.

Because, If we dont have to get up and move around to get to our car all we will have to get is wake up and go to your kitchen and make food.

With the Driverless cars everone in the world will become very lazy and if we are lazy other places that dont have these cars can attack us.

I'm starting to drive myself and about to get my licences in a couple of month and i love driving with the window little bit down feeling the nice wind and look out the front glass.

What if a animal jumps and hit the car who is going to fix up the car, Its self?

No, We will have to fix it up so that will mean more autoshops and less gasstations cause the car uses less gas then any other car in America.

What im trying to say is that driverless cars will not be good for us or anyone that uses it, google has a reason to us them, but they said it isnt fully driverless so that means the car needs us as much as we need it to get us places.

Cars are like peoples other son/girl.

We take care of it like it was a living person.

But, it isnt ment to auto drive, yes i like the auto breaks when something jumps in front of you and it will save your lifes time by time, but a fully driverless car is too much.
