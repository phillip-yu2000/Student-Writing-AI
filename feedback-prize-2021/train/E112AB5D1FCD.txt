Imagine your principal just annouced that all students must have an activity. He/she said the activity that it can be anything you want. The examples provided are such as, sports, extra studying, tutoring, and clubs. If there was a vote on having an extracurricular activity, I would vote "yes". There are many good and important reasons to have an activity, here is why.

My first good reason is that having an activity can be really fun. At the end of the school day, you would have something to look foward to. You can make new friends and spend some time with them. You can maybe discover a new hobby you are good at. You can do the stuff that makes you happy.

My next good reason for a having an activity, is that it would be helpful in school. If you are having trouble not understanding a subject or concept or your grades are low, this can solve that problem. By having private help from another person, this can make you understand a subject better. Also, it gives you a chance to bring your grade up. It can make you be a better learner or make you be ready and prepared for a test.

My final reason for having an activity is extra playing time for sports. School is sometimes fun, but if you like sports, than this is a good way to do the thing you really love. If you are just starting or just learning how to play, than this can be a big help. You would have the ability to know what to do in a practice drill or in a real game. This can make you be even better about baseball, basketball, or soccer etc.

In conclusion, having an extracurricular activity is a great idea. You can find the thing you are really good at. It is also a good time to socialize with other people. This is also one of the ways to get extra help in school. You can enjoy any of the things you love to do during this time of the day.Â
