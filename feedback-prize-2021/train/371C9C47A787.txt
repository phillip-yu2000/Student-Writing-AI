Say you want advice but you don't know where to get any, one way is by asking people for their opinion. Getting peoples opinion can help you in many ways like helping you become a better person, encourage you, or it could even help you learn something.

Getting advice is a good thing but it could be a bad thing as well. It could either help you become a better person or a bad person, advice could help you become a good person if people give you good advice such as donating clothes to the homeless or giving money to charity, but it could also result in you becoming a bad person due to someones bad advice, they could tell you to do drugs or smoke which aren't very good things.

Advice could also encourage you into something like maybe getting into sports such as football or baseball. Another way advice could encourage you is by you trying to raise money for something and spending your money wisely. Although people could encourage you to do horrible things so you will have to choose weather you listen to them or not.

One more way advice can help you is by teaching you. Advice could help you learn a lot of things like maybe learning that you're good at working on vehicles or you're very good at cleaning them. you could also learn a lot more like good universities to go to when your older or know what kind of job to get that will pay you a good amount of money.

Advice can help you in many ways like becoming a better person and donating money to charity, encouraging you to play sports, or help you learn something about yourself. So if you ever want good advice just ask someone and who knows maybe they will help you become successful in life!
