Dear Principal,

I have just heard that you wanted to change the policy where now you have to have a B to play sports. I think that this is very wrong to do. I believe in the "No pass, no play", which means that you should be able to make a C and still play sports. In fact, by making this change you could very well sideline some of your best players because they make a C. I understand that your grades mean everything, but it is not right to make players sit the bench because they don't make A' s or B' s. I believe that some people, even though they don't make good grades, are meant to earn a college scholarship to play football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, or even run track. I believe you should consider letting C' s slide.

I don't think this is totally right. If you do this, you might not could even field a team, which is very bad. We have a pretty good athletic program, which could drastically change very quickly if you change the policy. Thank you for your time.

With utmost respect,
