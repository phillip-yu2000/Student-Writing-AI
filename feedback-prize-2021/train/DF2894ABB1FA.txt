In today's society we have completely attached to our electronic devices; mainly our cell phones. Most people know to not text and drive or be on the phone while driving. Yet, what do you see, or even do on the daily basis: people on their phones. All it takes is one noise on their phone and they will be so quick to pick up their phones. Some people have the attitude that a car accident can never happen to them with or without their phones but fail to realize that is just not true.

Texts, social media, or another other phone alerts should never come before having your eyes on the road. Driving and phones are like oil and water; THEY DO NOT MIX! Even though there is a law where phones should not be in use while the car is on and somebody is on the road, there are still people who drive wreck less and risky with their phones in their hands.

It is very understandable if somebody needs to get in contact with you to make sure you're okay, to pick up something from the store, etc. but you should be as focused on the road as you possibly can be. You may be able to check your phone while driving and not get in a car accident but the person in front of, behind, or across from you may not be able to do the same thing and could cause an accident.

When a phone is in a person's hand while they are driving, they tend to make mistakes while driving. Little do they know, those itty bitty mistakes can lead to somebody losing their life. All it takes is phone someone to be somewhere at the wrong place and time and then- BAM! They've lost their life or will have to be in critical condition to a jackass on the road who was on their phones and not paying attention. Not to mention the fees and raise of insurance they will have to endure JUST for being on their phones. There will always be a time and place for cell phones but on the road is not one of them. Spread the word and save a life.
