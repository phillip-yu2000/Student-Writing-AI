Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I am writing you this letter because I think that you should really consider policy 2. If you consider policy 2 i guarantee that you would make the school a little safer. Three reasons i think this is one there would be less traffic in the hallways ; two its easier to learn without a distraction ,and three it doesn't cause any problems.

It would cause less traffic in the hallways than if you were aloud to use phones. If you were aloud to use phones then students would take advantage of this they would think that the hallway is considered their free time. this would cause a lot of chaos. Many kids would get hurt because they would not be watching where they are going. This is very unsafe.

Another reason that policy 2 is better is because policy one would make it difficult for some students to learn. If kids had it out in their free time it could just be when they are done with their work, but some kids could still be working. this would cause a distraction. Also if somebody has their phone out when the teacher is trying to teach students would be focussed on them not the teacher. Then students wouldn't learn anything ,and isn't that the whole purpose of school is to learn something.

My final reason that you should have no cell phones at school is because it doesn't cause any problems. It helps more than it hurts not having cell phones at school. Without cell phones you don't have that many distractions. Not everyone is worried about who's texting who. Also kids can't record fights and post them.

If you pick policy 2 you shall see that it will pay off.

These are just three reasons to pick policy

2.

Thank you for taking your time to read this letter. please consider my opinion.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
