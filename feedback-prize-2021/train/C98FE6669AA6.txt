Have you ever had to make a decision but your just indecisive? They always say "everything happens for a reason." But what can we do when we're indecisive? Advice can be a fantastic solution to problems. I believe talking to different people can play a huge role in this decision.

Advice has helped me a lot throughout the years. Whether it's family, friends, or maybe even your teacher! Maybe the person your talking to has been in your same shoes. This helps so much because they can tell you what they did or even the outcome of the situation. Often, if someone is in your same shoes then it makes it so much easier to decide. I have been in a situation similar to this. Good thing my mom helped me get through it because she had been in the exact situation. Trust someone to keep this decision to themselves. It would be awful if a friend told everyone at school right? Don't be scared to talk to people because they could've been in your shoes one time.

Talking to different people really sees every ones different opinions. Seeing what everyone thinks and believes is important.

Seeing every ones opinions can make your choice easy and way less stressful. Dont feel like all the pressure is on you. It's your choice and don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't do!

At the end of the day, the decision is yours to make and it dosen't matter what anyone else says. I hope both of these strategies can help you and make it less stressful, easier, and less pressure on yourself.
