i believe that we shouldnt have driverless cars because it puts people at greater risk and its alot of money people would be putting into this design and we could be using the money for something else. what would be the point of a driverless car if you still potentially need a driver to take over when thngs get bad. in paragraph 7 it states that the car can only steer, accelerate, and brake themselves and all the designes are notified when the driver should take control, meaning that people still always have to be aware and pay attention so way waste money on something us people can already do without all the extra equipment. and whos to say something wont go wrong if the car goes out of control or the computer system breaks that would be alot of money to be able to get that fixed. Dr. Werner Huber said"We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way" there is no reason at all for us to create something that is not needed and could potentially be dangerous just because we want to create somthing thats fun. in conclusion we should not have driverless cars because whos to say something bad wont happen and it would be greatly expensive and you still need a driver to be alert so these computer cars wouldnt be necessary at all.
