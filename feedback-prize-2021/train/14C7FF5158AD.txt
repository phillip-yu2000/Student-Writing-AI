This piece is about why scientist should explore Venus. The author supported his or her claim of exploring Venus well. The author provides evidence to counter Venus's harsh conditions.

The author gives many reasons why Venus is a dangerous planet. For example, the author says that there is a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide, not only that but the clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid. The surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The author also mentions that the geology and weather is chaotic as well. The author manages to give some evidence for each of the dangers of Venus. He or she states that scientists can hover thirty-some miles above the surface to avoid geological and most weather hazards. It is also said that hovering up high will decrease the temperature down to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure to Earth's sea level. This gives the idea that a human survivng on Venus is not easy but possible. The author gives that fact that NASA is currently working on electronics that can withstand Venus's surface, and the longest it has lasted is three weeks, so scientists can gather artifacts from Venus and study them.

The author provides evidence in that scientists are currently working to combat Venus's harsh conditions. The evidence present shows that it is possible to counter the planet's harsh conditions and also how close the humans are to being able to explore Venus.
