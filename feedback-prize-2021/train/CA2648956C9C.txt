2,000 animlals dead! What if you had to go and help take them across the sea?! Well Luke does, you can play games, you get to see different kinds of animals, and help different countries and see different things. Would you do this or would you not even think about it?

You get to play games, such as volley ball baseball, and table-tennis. Also fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling games. The other guys will play with you and things like that. Luke also is with his friend so you can talk to one of your friends. An if they wanted to do it with you.

You get to see different kinds of animlas. He gets to go to a whole bunch of different countries that got destroid. So they may need to take a girrafe or a monkey you've never seen before. You also get to take care of thoughs animals, and pet. You kinda get to be the owner of the animals.

You get to help different countries out and see different things. Like Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece. He got to take a Gandola ride in Vinece Italy, a city with streets of water. He also got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal. He was happy that he was able to help people out.

I hope that you join this cattle boat. Hopefully you were inspired enough. Like I said there's a lot of things to do on the boat.
