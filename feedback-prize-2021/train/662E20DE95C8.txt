PUT YOUR

CELL PHONE AWAY OR IM GONNA KEEP IT! That's what all teachers say to the students that have there cell phones out and they are right because what do we need with our cell phones in school all of our friends are around us we get to use on the weekends, after school pretty much all the time. When we are in school it is the teacher's time to teach us what we need to know so we can have a good job and not grow stupid and living on the side of the street. Cell phones are one of the main distractions to teens that's why they can't get their homework done, or forget to do their chores. They might not pay attention in class because their probably on FACEBOOK but that's a whole different story. I agree with the teachers one hundred percent because when your in school for seven in a half hours if I'm not mistaken that's it and that's all your teacher need's and some students cannot even do that. It's really getting out of hand because some students get caught and when the teacher asks for the phone then it's a huge issue and it's not the teachers fault because you should have never had your cell phone out in the first place.
