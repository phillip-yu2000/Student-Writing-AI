Driverless cars would increase the safety of driving on roads.

Driverless cars take away issues like human error.

Driverless cars would also reduce crashes, and deathes, involving drunk driving and texting while driving.

These would still be issues, for with all rules some are broken, however with driverless cars the effects of these incidents wouldn't be nearly as costly.

Driverless cars allow for total control of the car at all times, something quite difficult for a human driver to achieve.

Using devices such as the LIDAR and GPS, the car would have complete awareness of its surroundings,

while a human driver can only strongly focus on a single direction at a time.

With driverless cars including precautions such as the car alerting the human inside if they need to take manual control of the car, driverless cars are never truly driverless, almost like with an airplane.

There is never only one pilot, the main pilot always has a copilot to take control if there is an issue that the main pilot can't handle alone.

The main causes of car crashes are human error related, such as driving under the influence or texting while driving.

Neither of these problems will have as huge of a cost to them if there are driverless cars involved.

The driverless car will be able to respond to a stopping car faster than a person if they had been texting.

Driverless cars will improve the quality of driving, as well as the safety of driving.

In driverless cars, humans can be productive in other areas, such as doing homework or finishing a file report for a job.

With only limited focus being needed of the human while the car is driving, the human's time can be managed more effectively.

Having a computer drive the car would reduce the number of crashes that occur from drivers falling asleep at the wheel as well as other crash starters.

All in all using driverless cars would greatly increase the quality and safety of being on the road.
