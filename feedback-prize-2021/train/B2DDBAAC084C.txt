ou can ask many different people for advice. Perhaps a teacher or a consular, maybe even a parent.

Asking a teacher for advice can be very helpful and effective. You could be asking for advice on something in their class like math,science or history, but you could surely ask them for advice on anything. like how to make a friend or how to help a friend with something going on. Maybe ask a designer teacher or a workshop teacher for advice on how to decorate a room or house. You can pretty much ask your teachers for advice on anything school related or not.

When asking a consular for advice you can literately get advice on anything,same thing goes with a therapist. They both give good advice for things going on at home, school, work and just everyday life. They'll give you advice on everything. All you have to do is ask for it, and tell them what its about. I generally think that consular are good people to ask for advice from.

Last but certainly not least parents. Asking parents for advice can be helpful, but sometimes its can be awkward and stressful and you dont get the help that you needed. Parents can give advice on everything, but it may not be the best to follow, sometimes parents or just people in general dont believe what you believe in, so you might not get the answer your looking for.

But over all asking multiple people for advice is good because you can get many different opinions to find the best one you like. Because going with one opinion and one option could turn out wrong. But if your gut says go for it, then go for it. Those are the reasons i think you should get advice from multiple different people, because then you will find your true answer.
