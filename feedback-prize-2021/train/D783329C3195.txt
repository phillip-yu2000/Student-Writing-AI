The use of technology to read the emotional expression of students face in a classroom is valuable. Its valuable because its helps students be interested in something their doing. For example the passage says, " If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow". That shows it keeps you interested and will keep kids interested.

Another reason I think we should have technology to read emotions is because it could also help teachers no what he or she should do to keep the children entertained like the computer. If this keeps the children entertain it'll help them learn better because if the kid is not interested then they will not watch the lesson your teaching them.

One raeson I think wde shouldn't have them in a class room is becasue it will distact kids because it'll have the kids focused on technology instead of learning thats the only reason i think we shouldn't have them.

Those are some reasons why I think we should and shouldn't have technology to raed emotions expressions.
