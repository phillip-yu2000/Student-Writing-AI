What would you do if you have a problem? Many people get edvice from some one they trust,but it doesn't always help. I think you should get edvice from multiple people it gives multiple side,experience,and more ways to solve problem.

First,I feel people should get edvice from multiple people because when getting multiple sides to a problem you get multiple points of view. You might ask yo mother something then ask yo father he may have a different feeling about the situation from yo mother,but now you have multiple ways to solve your problem.

Studies show that 85% of people who seeks multiple edivice has a better outcome than people who only seek edvice from one person.

Next,when only getting edvice some people are mor experienced

Some people are better in certain situations. For example Generic_Name is a football player,and his coach to him from quaterback to play cornerback he didn't like that. Generic_Name needs help on what he should do he's going to ask his friends Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Generic_Name is a basketball player,but Generic_Name is a football player who edvice would be the best?

Third, gives multiple ways to solve the problem. If you only ask one person for edvice you don't have that many options to solve yo problem. When asking one peron there edvice is not always the best edvice. For example I am not a good writer and I have a writting test tomorrow i don't know what i should di so i ask my friend,but the edvice she gave me didn't help,and i failed my test. What would have happened if i asked multiple people? maybe if i would have asked other people if her idea didn't work I had other planes.

Some people think it's best to get edvice from one person. When people have a problem they usaully ask someone they trust. When only one person for edvice it doesn't always work out. I feel people should ask multiple people for edvice it gives them two sides,experience,different ways to solve their problem.
