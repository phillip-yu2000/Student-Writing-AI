A few years ago a kid named Generic_Name was the best wrestler in the county, but before wrestling started him and his friends would get in trouble with the law a lot. The town where Generic_Name grew up in had a lot of violence and drugs, and it was not a good influence on him. One day, one of Generic_Name's favorite teacher told him about a sport called "wrestling", when he looked into it and tried it out, he soon realized that wrestling was something he would enjoy. After practice the coach came over to Generic_Name and explained that if he wanted to stay on the team he would need to keep his grades up along with not getting in trouble. By the end of the year Generic_Name was an A,B

student and has not gotten in trouble with the law since wrestling started. Being in extracurricular activities makes you less likely to get in trouble and encourages you to keep your grades up.

My principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity like : sports, work on the yearbook or clubs. I for one completely agree with him. One reason is because when you are doing something you enjoy like a sport you want to stay on the team, and are less likely to do something to get in trouble. Another is because when you get out in the world you can meet new people and make new friends. The final reason is because when you are on a team you have to have good grades and those sports and extracurricular activities will encourage you to keep your grades up if there something you enjoy doing.

When your in those clubs or on a team your friends can help you out with problems, and it is good to know you can talk to your teammates about problems you may have. one of my best friends became a county champ this year and he didnt even want to wrestle at the beginning of the year but on the wrestling team where like a family and we helped him out with his problems and now he is a county champ.
