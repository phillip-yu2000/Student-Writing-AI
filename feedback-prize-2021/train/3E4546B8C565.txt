Dear Senator,

Im sorry to say this but the electoral college is in fact, unfair and irrational.

It is unfair to voters and is one fo the things that make it even worst is what we call the " Disaster Factor". Its called disaster for a reason!

The electoral is very unfair to voters. When someone is voting for president, they do not want to be voting  for a slate of electors, I am pretty sure they want to be voting for who they think should represent them and their country. For example, if you lived in the state of Texas, and you wanted to vote for Jhon Kerry, you wouldnt be voting for him, but you would be voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. Suppose that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congresss and John Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are these electors? Who picks the electors anyways? ( stated in " Whats wrong with the electoral college?" )

There is apparently something called the "Disaster Factor" just because of the electoral college. As stated in the article, "Whats wrong with the constitution?", "... American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, the system allows for much worst.." What if something worst happened, just like the 2000 fiasco? All the way back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legestlature almost accomplished replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who wouldnt vote for John F. Kennedy. Also, in 1960, Hawaii sent 2 slates of electors to congress ("Whats wrong with the electoral college")

In conclusion, the electoral college is unfair and irrational. It should be abolished and we honestly do not need it much. There should be a popular vote from the people of the United States. After all, democracy was made for a reason, the people should be the ones who rule most of the time. I rest my case.
