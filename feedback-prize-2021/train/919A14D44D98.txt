Why do most people ask one or more than one person for advice? In my opinion is because the person who is seeking for advice has one already but wants to hear what another person says about the situation, they want to learn from other people who been in the same situation as them, and they just might not know what to do in that situation they are in.

First, some people just want to hear the same advice they have already. They want to make sure if people think the same as them. Also they might want to know more to do in that problem. They might ask for more advice because they are not sure of their own.

Then, they want to learn from others who been in the same situation. They are trying not to do the same mistakes as the other person did. The person does not want to through the same problem as the other person did. They just want to know how to go through the situation or get over it quickly. They want to ask because they want to check for themselves not to do the same mistakes or mess something up.

Finally, the person might not know what to do in the situation. They are seeking help from another person who knows more or has more experience in that situation. Also they want to get advice from people who are wise or know more stuff because they been in a similar situation. They might want to know what to do before they do anything that is messed up or something.

In conclusion, people ask for advice because they are not certain of their own. They just want to make sure not to do anything bad or mess things up with a person they care about. They want to know how to handle a situation they have never been in before. They are trying to get over something that's why they ask a lot of people for advice. Also they want to make sure if people think like them so they can feel more confident about their opinion.
