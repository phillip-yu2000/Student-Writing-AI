My names Luke and

I got invited to the Seagoing Cowboys Program by my friend Don Reist.

At the time i was working two part-time jobs. I knew that this was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime so obviously i accepted Don's invitation.

We got our first orders in August 1945 to report to new orleans.

We were smooth sailing from that point on.

As i was on the ships i learned a lot of valueable lessons.

Being on the Seagoing Cowboys program was such a blessing and it had quite a few perks.

We got to visit a lot of cool and different places around the world.

Not only did we get to visit them we also got to learn a few things about them.

Being on the Seagoing Cowboy progams is not just all fun and games it is also a lot or hardwork.

Feeding and taking care of the animals is real hardwork. In the article is says " Caring for the animals in the crossings kept me busy."

This was very true because the work kept you very tired.

All things have to come to a end though.

When we finally did drop off the animals and all thier food and supplies we got to have a little fun.

After the animals were unloaded us cowboys got to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds were the animlas were being housed. I think if your a hardworker your sure to do just fine in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you do go and become in the Seagoing Cowboys program a good peice of advice is to watch your step because some nights the ships tend to get a little slippery.
