Dear Principal:

"Ring, Ring, Ring"

The teachers looks at the student. The student goes and takes her phone out of her bag and starts texting in her class. i believe the students should not be allowed to use their phones in free time. If they use their phones they will disturb their class mates, they will not focus on their work and they will not pass to the other grade.

To begin with, i believe that students should not have phones on campus because they will disturb everybody that wants to learn. What if the phone ringed in the middle of your class and the girl or boy goes and picks up the phone. When he or she douse that the student will start talking really loud and giggling. It will cause the other students to not concentrate and fail their test. The sad thing about it is that the teacher cant do everything because he or she has done the test and has nothing to do.

Together with disturbing the class there is also that the student will not focus on their work. They will be to busy texting on their phones that they will not get to focus on the school work. They will not do their home work and will not pass the FCAT at the end of the school year. The teacher will give them work to do but they will not learn how to do it because they did not pay attention. They will have bad grades in all their classes and even drop out of the school they are in.

Last but not least the student will not be able to pass to the other grade level. With no work done and with little learning they will not pass the big test the FCAT. If they don't pass that in the state of Florida they will stay behind and have no education what so ever. The other
