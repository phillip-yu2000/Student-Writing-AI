Dear principal,

I am writing this letter to argue the facts that it is not fair for students under a b average to be taken out of sports and other activities. One reason i say that it is not is that not all students in our school may not all work at the same level or pace as others. Like for instance, a grade b average may be a great score for usual students but, say that you are trying your hardest at trying to learn like the other students but you are not quite "picking up" lessons and assignments that well. That should not mean that you are held away from activities or sports but try and be motivated to try harder and achieve at a higher standard.

Also, taking students that have at least a c average should not have to suffers consequences like that as say a student with an failing grade should be treated. I say that because taking someone out of a sports activity or any other activity should not be a consequence just because they are not at that high standard. now on the other hand, for a failing student, consequence like being unable to participate in non school related activities can be applied doing that it way be like taking a privilege that they may not deserve away from them.

To conclude, i really do not understand reason to convey a policy like that of taking privileges away from students if they are not at that level of a b.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
