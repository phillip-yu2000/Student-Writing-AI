Don't you like to some times drive and have somewhat freedom? You won't have no fun sitting in car and not driving.

If we have self driving cars we still need to pay attention to the rode so we don't get in a crash and when the car want humans to take over. If the car requires human skills for navagating through a work zone wont it be a lot of problems.

If we have self driving cars we wont have to work to get I.D. No more and teens wont be happy that they don't have their name on a plastic card that says you can go almost where ever you want.

We will lose some things like multitasking because are brian is used a lot when we drive and if we listen to the radio. We will just be listening to music or on are phones just rotting brain cells.

Thats why i think we should not have self driving cars, because we will lose some freedom and skip some parts of growing up
