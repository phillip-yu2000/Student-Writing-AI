I believe policy 1 is better because a lot of people may have very important reasons for using their cell phones such as calling their parents or family members because they maybe sick or any other personal things and they want to stay in touch to make sure they are okay. Other possible reasons could be is maybe they forgot something at home like their homework or lunch that they need for school and they need their parents could come and drop it off for them.

There are many other reasons we should be able to use them but not as important such as maybe changing plans as for getting picked up with their friends which isn't really bad because they just want to check in with their parents to see if its okay. i think we should be able to use our cell phones for certain reasons or even just because its fun as long as we don't use them during class time.

Of coarse Policy 2 isn't wrong because many kids use their cell phones for wrong reasons such as picking fights and texting during class and using them to cheat on test which is wrong but I really think its very reasonable for us to be able to use our cell phones because the important reasons are more likely than the negative reasons.
