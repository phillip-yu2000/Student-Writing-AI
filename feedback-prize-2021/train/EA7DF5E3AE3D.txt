When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. These are just 3 reasons why talking to more than one person can help you make better choices. You can get more of peoples opinions, you can get a better idea of what to pick, and it helps you get rid of the other choices.

Say you have to make a decisionÂ on what restaurant to go to and you have 4 choices. Theres Olive Garden, Taco bell, Sonic and Chick`Fla. Its easy to chose from but you still van decide so u call your friends. now you ask them because its easier to get other peoples opinion so Sonic gets 1 vote, Olive Garden gets 1 vote, Taco bell gets 2 votes, and Chick`Fla gets 2 votes. So, now you can take out Sonic and Olive Garden because they got 1 and the others got 2. Thats just one way to get a easier way to get a choice.

So, now you have a better idea of what to pick because you got other peoples opinions. Next, you have to decide from the 2 choices that yall left, because now u have a better idea of where to eat. So, getting peoples opinions helps you get better idea. Say, you voted again and Taco bell got 1 this time and Chick`Fla got 5 this time so now you can take out Taco bell and go eat some Chick`Fla.

Now, that you asked all of your friends for help it got rid of your other options. So, now you can go to the restaurant that you all have decided on. Because, you asked for opinions so now you get what you needed to get done faster, and now all of your options are gone because you asked your friends. So, they help you get rid of unwanted options so now you can go enjoy your meal.
