Kids should always make decisions, and its nice that they get to choose because you cant choose everything in life by just asking someone they cant choose for you its up to you to choose choices in life.

i think its a great idea to choose student council or year book even in sports. in my opion i think i would do sports and like maybe the kids will too you never know. It is very important to make your own decisions you dont wanna be in a store and then you dont know what to choose because you have never made your own choices. Yes i think the choices could be better but it doe sent hurt to try something new so i agree on this. You should never be afraid to do different stuff in life you just gotta try something new for once.

See everything happens it self would if one day you apply for a job and they ask you something about student couciling then what are you gonna do you cant get the job all because of one thing. You wanna be able to do this stuff so you can get a job when you older in life, now i mean if your not gonna get a job then go ahead but even if you dont want you should still try something just in case you change your mind.

I think its a great idea to do it, it keeps kids active and it makes everything fun and keeps them motivated to try out more stuff in life and have fun with the choices that you make.

The principal is right he trying to keep them engaged learners and help them succeed in life. and kids can make them selves better because of it it can help you in life when i need it most people always wonder why do we need this stuff if we are not gonna use it well i can tell you one day you will and you will be great full for what group you was in.
