I think we should change the electoral college to the popular vote for many reasons. I think that the electoral college causes alot of disgreements and agruements. I think we should do this for every election not just the election of the United States of Americas President. I dont think its fair that some states get more votes than another states. We should all be equal like the George washington wanted us to be as he and many others signed the US Constition and The Declartion of Independence. Like Cali. has 55 electrolal votes and wyoming has like 4 how does that make them feel.

If one President is like by the whole nation then he should become president no doubt. Just because someone else get more elctoral votes but isnt the popular why should he be President. Like one candiate could get 10 states that are voting for him but their only states with 4 votes then the other candidate gets californa even the other half of californa doesnt want him. He wins because winner takes all and that 55 to his 10 sates which equals 40.
