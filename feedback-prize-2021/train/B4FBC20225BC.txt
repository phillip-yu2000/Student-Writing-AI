If you ever get the oppurtunity to go across the sea to help others then I would say heck yeah, because I love to help others and I think it would be fun to see all the cool places that you travel to help others in your free time.

You should join the program because if you like to be with animals and you like to help others get back on their feet then I suggest to you to say yes if get the oppurtunity. You should also say yes if you've always wanted to go across the sea's. Luke got to go to Rome,Europe,and China. Even though it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic from the Eastern United States to China I am pretty sure that it was worth it. You can also have alot of fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball gamesin the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time on board.

I think it would be fun to do this because you would get to help others, be with animals, have fun on board, and see really cool places. I would say yes would you?
