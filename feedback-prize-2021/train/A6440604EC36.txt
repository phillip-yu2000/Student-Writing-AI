Dear TEACHER_NAME

I believe that cell phones should be allowed at school. There are a lot of people that get sick or need to call there parents for an emergency. A lot of people have a sickness and need special vitamins and pills and their parent need to bring it to them. Also break and lunch is their free time to get away from work and teachers to do something else but work. In that free time they may use their phone.

Most kids are responsible enough to put away their phone in class. The parents get the kids a phone for a reason .They trust their kid with it so why cant the schools. The phone isn't doing any thing to the schools. It isn't messing with other kids. So why cant we just bring them to school and use them only during break, lunch and for emergency's. Policy number one is the best choice for this situation.

Sincerely,
