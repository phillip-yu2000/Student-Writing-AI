Dear Principle,

I think Policy 1 is the better choice because this allows the students to have their phones at school. Even if you went with Policy 2, the students would still bring their phones to school. They would ignore the "No Phones At School" rule.

So I think you should go with Policy 1 because it will allow the students some time to be on their phone. I think that if you went with Policy 1 you would have less problems with the students sneaking in their phones to school and into class.

If you went with Policy 1 the students would be able to make arrangements with friends and parents on their lunch break or free time.

If you went with Policy 2 and banned all cell phones from school, you would have to deal with students texting in class and bringing their phones to school anyway. I think you should go with Policy 1 instead of Policy 2 because at least Policy 1 allows the students to have some cell phone time, but if a students grades were dropping because of the cell phone rule than I think you should talk to the student and the students parents and discipline that student and not the whole school.

You also have to think about the students and their grades, for instance if a student has anything below a C(which is average) than I feel that they should not be able to go on their phones. If a student is passing all classes with at least a C, or if they have all A' s or B' s than they should be able to use their phones during their free time.

Than again it is your choice on which cell phone policy you want, but I think that you should go with Policy 1. You would have less trouble with the students sneaking in their cell phones.

Sincerely,

Student
