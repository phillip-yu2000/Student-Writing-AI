Distance learning will benefit a lot of students. It will allow students to keep up to date with school. It would be a better fit for students that are shy around others. It would benefit students that have to work and cant be in school.

Distance learning will help students to keep up to date with class work. It will allow students to complete work on there own time. Students wouldnt have to worry about missing school. They can work at there own pace and not worry about being rushed to learn a subject.

It would also help students that are shy. It would give them a chance to speak with a teacher one on one,on video conferencing. It would be less stress then going to school. It allows students to learn better on there own. They dont have to worry about other students.

It allows students to get a job and help out there family if needed. They wouldnt have to stress about going to school everyday and not be able to work. It frees up more time for other activities as well. They can do sports or take extra classes.

Thats why i think its good that some schools offer distance learning. It benefits a lot of students that need the extra help. It gives them a better chance to finish school early. Attending classes from home would also be a lot safer now in days then school. Thats why distance learning is the best option.
