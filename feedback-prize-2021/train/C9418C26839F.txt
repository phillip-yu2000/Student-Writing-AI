Dear, Principal I would like to say that community service time would be a great way to get kids involved in their own community.

Some ideas that you could use is to tutor elementary students, clean litter, do monthly cleanups, recycle, take trips to retirement homes, and help the elderly. By using some of my ideas I truly believe that we could change are community .Also that we could hopeful change the way students see are community in a good and healthy way.

Furthermore, in my ideas i said something about helping the elderly, In my mind I believe we need to give are up most respect for them they are the ones that helped create the country we are living in. Most students think that elderly people are just mean and asinine but they truly are nice people we just have different ways of looking at ideas. I myself used to be the same way with elderly people i just thought they were old and asinine but one day my sunday school group from church took me along with them to a retirement home, i truly learned that elderly people are just in a over all just trying to live the way that they were brought up in.

On the contrary, tutoring elementary students would help are younger students understand the content that they are learning class but in a way that they can grasp it. tutoring younger students could help them learn shortcuts to doing many things that their teacher tell them. by teaching a younger student shortcuts to be coming good a many different subjects would maybe help test scores. Tutoring a younger student could better prepare them for their up coming years of school and many different grades.
