Dear TEACHER_NAME:

Over the past few days you have been trying to decide whether or not to require all students to perform community service. Many students have already chosen to do community service such as tutoring elementary school children and cleaning up litter. To set this as a standard is a remarkable idea.

In this world, there is much litter due to all the packaged products, most of which ends up on the streets of our town, taking away of the beauty of it. Having students adopt a highway could really improve it, making our school proud. Also, community service is a great way to improve a student's behavior, and looks great on a college application. Therefore, creating a requirement of it would make everyone from students to teachers happy.

Though some students may feel that community service is a waste of their free time, it really isn't. While they pick up litter, they will be around friends and enjoying themselves, while getting the job done. Or while they tutor a child, they will be enhancing their ability to get along with a child for babysitting job as a teen and will also be preparing for their future as a parent.

As you can see, while community service looks great on a college application, it also sets for well behaved students in the classroom. This is a great way to improving the future of your students.

Thank You,
