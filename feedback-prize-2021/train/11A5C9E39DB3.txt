Yes, the use of this technology is very valuable in many ways. The technology can detect how you are feeling, in the passage it tells you that the computer can tell if a human is mad, happy, sad, worried, etc.

This technology can be very useful to techers as well as anyone else. If a student is feeling a lot of emotion and trying to do school work, they will be more focused on what they were feeling instead of the work the teacher has given him/her. It can also help the teacher to know how exactly to act twards a student. For example, if a student is feeling 75% sad they are most likely going to cry. If a student is about to cry and teacher starts yeling at them for not paying attention, because the student isn't feeling like themselves that day its going to trigger the students brain to make them cry.

In conclusion, this tehcnology in my opinion should most defiently be used in schools. Not only to help the teachers out, but for the stundents themelves. I think that if we use this technology it will increase focuse on school work will improve moods, and increase better grades and testing scores.
