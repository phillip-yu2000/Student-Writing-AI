The use of technology that can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable so the students can learn, or understand the subject better by using facial recongnition.

The essay states that "Most human communication is verbal, including human communication" so when someone is communicating their emotions with another person, it might not be true. Dr. Huang predicts that " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then is could modify the lesson." modifying the lesson to the students content facial expression, could make the student understand the things better. For example, on a website when an ad appears, if you smile, "a similar ad may follow. but if you frown, the next ad will be different." the same thing can happen on a classroom computer to help the student.

In conclusion, having a classroom computer that recognizes your facial expressions is valuable and may really help a student understand or learn something in class easier.
