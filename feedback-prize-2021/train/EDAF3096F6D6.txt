I Think that the technolgy really can't tell ore actual emotions. I believe this because some people can just pretend to be smiling and look happy but you really dont know what they are actually feeling. They coukd be sad, angry, depressed we can never know what they truly feel just by the look of someone. Some people just pretend to be okay because they dont want people asking or worrying. But also sometimes you can tell that there is actually wrong with them because the maybe try to act like they are okay but they really cant hold it for so long.

Technology can maybe believe that they know someones emotions by their faces expressions but the inside is what actually matters if you really know how someone feels. But also sometimes it can be very confusing because they are showing a lot of diffferent emotions and they are maybe confused themself. But thats okay a lot of people feel that way. Technology is very smart and uts becoming bigger as time goes by but i know and believe that technology cant really know how someone is actually feeling. They can tell by the face but not the true feeling.

"Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?" Maybe if you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're feeling sad maybe you can see it in your face because its actually you feeling sad. But someone really doesnt know just by the face just you cause its you. And its the same for technology they really cant tell what your emotion is just by looking at you. unless you're really happy and sometimes you can actually show an emotion inside and out and if your computer can tell an actual emotion thats true well maybe because you really are feeling happy, sad, Etc. So I believe that technogly really cont tell someones emotions.
