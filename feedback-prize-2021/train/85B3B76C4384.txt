Dear Principle,

I think students should take a part of community service hours because every one should help in everything in our town. So i will take the position of people having to do community service hours. students should because the have to help the world be a better place. Others made mistakes and now should help clean up if they did litter. Some people like to help other kids in homework or learn other things like have difficult times so I say we should. Some of my friends think that this takes to much of our time but it is fun when you see what you did and people with happy faces it makes me feel happy inside.

So would you just let people do community service hours and let them understand what it means to help out the world. They should feel happy that the world has a lot of people to help them clean up but they don't do there part in this world. For example there are many trees dyeing and they should help plant more and the will grow into healthy trees.
