dear principle,

If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy i think the best idea is to choose policy one. Policy one is the better choice to pick, not only is it more favored by the rest of the students, but it gives the students responsibility. Also policy two is a bad choice, not giving the students the right to have their cell phones is wrong when almost all of them has one. A rule like this is easy to break and many students will get into trouble. If you make it a rule that students can not have their cell phones at all, the students will bring them anyway and if they are already breaking a rule by just having them, most of them will break more of the rules and start using the cell phones. Policy two, i think, is a horrible choice. Policy one however, is an excellent choice. Students will be happy that they can have their cell phones and be able to use them in the time given.
