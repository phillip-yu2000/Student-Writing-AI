I dont think we should keep the electoral college. I think we should abolish it. My reason is because we are not doing what we said we were going to do back when we signed the Constitution. We said that we were going to let the people vote for who was going to govern us. It's not fair to the people if they're wasting their time.

I think that it isn't fair to the people of America that they dont get to really pick the president of the U.S. I think that people should vote for the president not for slate of electors. I also dont think it's fair that sometimes their vote counts and sometimes it doesn't. What if the government would have pick the president back in the 1960's? We would probably be still having marches against segregation and marches for voting rights.

I know that the electoral college has some benefits, like avoiding "the problems of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast". Like in 1968 Nixon had 43 percent of the popular vote. Also in 1992 Clinton had 43 percent of the popular vote as well. The run-off elections come with a extreme amount of pressure. But it really  complicates the process of the presidental election. However, the pressure is reduced by the electoral college. On the other hand some states like California and Texas's votes have no effect at that point.

Voters in the presidental election are people that want their vote to count. But we're not letting that vote count if we let the electoral college vote for us and choose who the president is. So we should just let the peolpe vote who the want.
