We use cars for many things. We use them for work, for getting supplies and grocures and most importantly, we use them to get places alot quicker. But cars harm are environment in some pretty bad ways. They create greenhouse emissions and Smog. Which is why the world is trying to rid itself of cars.

Cars of today and back run on gasoline which we get from fossil fuels that we get from the ground. This resource wont last forever and will eventually disapear if we keep using it. The stuff created from cars exhaust pipes damages are air supply and are environment. it creates smog in the air which is bad for the lungs to inhale. Like the people in Vauban, Germany who dont even drive cars, im sure there air is clean or atleast alot cleanier than ours is.

i Believe we should find a new solution to cars other than just removing them from use. i Believe they should produce more electric cars. Yes, it may not go along with the american dream of having a roaring engine and a blower sticking out of the hood but it will save our planet one step at a time. And being a car lover i wouldnt want to see cars go but i think a change to electric would fine and helpful.

Like it says in source 2, places like paris and bejing are some of the most poluted places in the world. If we dont find another solution to are cars its just going to get worse. The smog pollutes are air and the thick warm air traps it in our ecosystem. Alot less people are driving every year and thats good which means less harm to the planet.

I love cars wether its muscle or sport but sadly we wont be able to drive them forever unless we do something about it and make a change, a word the world is scared of. People should buy more electric cars or invest in or just not drive at all. Ride a bike or something, americans need the bike ride and im sure the rest of the world could use one too.       Â
