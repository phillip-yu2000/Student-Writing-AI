Lest be real to ourselves, when teachers assigned students to complete a summer project, the majority will end up leaving it to a side and they will prefer to focus in other activities that they may have fun. Why? But why not?. The idea of students designed their own summer projects is valid because it will be less stressful for them and it will assure that the student complete it.

First, its a real fact that students dont like school at all; since they start students cant wait for their next break, so give them more work to do during their break will end up making them feel a lot of stress that can affect their social, personal or educative life. But, if they had the a chance to select their own projects, it can become a fun or interesting assignment for them because it will be of their choice.

Students usually believe that the majority of what they can learn at school is not even important for the real world; so students decide to just not complete the work teachers assigned and they start doing what they think its better for them. But if schools allowed students to designed their summer projects, it will make sure that they can focus more on what its real important for them; and it will be a joyful feeling for students to finish their assignment that they made.

Finally, students when they're during summer break, they're really focusing on personal goals and having some joyful time. By letting them to designed their own summer projects will assure that its completed and it will be less mental stress for them. However, teachers have to make sure that those summer projects will be teaching them the correct things.
