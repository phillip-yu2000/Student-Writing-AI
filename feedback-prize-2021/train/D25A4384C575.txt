In the passage "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author claims that though Venus's conditions are to extream for that of a human it is still good to study and explore the planet! and says the "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well oce have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."

The author says the Venus has many geological Earth like structures such as Valleys, Moutans, craters ect... and that Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for a planetary visit. which is very true and may provide insite to what may oneday happen to our own planet known as Earth, NASA is even looking into it and has already figured out that staying a little over 30 miles above the surface of Venus a human given the right equitment may be survivable though it will not be easy!

So in conclusion yes I do think that it is reasonable to resurch Venus and continue to study it would be a worthy persute dispite the dangers it brings because we will never see infinity, but we can choose to dream byond.
