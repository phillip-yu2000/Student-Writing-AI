Luke's point of view convincing others to participate in the seagoing cows program.

Luke did not know that when he grauated from high school it will become hard. He has to work two part time job to get money to buy his own stuff.

So one day his friend asked him to go to Europe with him he could not say no because it was a big opportunity of a lifetime.

In 1945 world war two was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover there food supplies animals and more 44 nations joined together to help these people get all the things they need and all they supplies they need to help the animals thats why Luke and Dan sign up to help the animals and peole to get better and get the stuff they need to survive.

Thats why Luke and this friend Dan wants you to be in the seagoing cowboy group beacuse wants you to learn how to help other and do somethink nice just to do it and just to give because giving is nice beacause some people in that country like i said dont have food supplies now if you help them get that they will have enough to feed kids themselfs and others that dont have food.
