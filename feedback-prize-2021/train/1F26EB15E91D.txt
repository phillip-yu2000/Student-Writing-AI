Dear school principal,

I do not think that kids should do community service because they could have other school activity's to do like band or sports. If its during the day then it is fine but when it is after school kids should hang out with there friends and do sports then do community service. If they wanted to or there mad them then that is fine but if you make them then they should not have to do it. What happens if they have travel softball, soccer or volleyball. If it is during the school day then yes but is they are doing any sports they should not have to do community service. I mean some kids might like reading to other kids like first or second graders but if they are in the middle school or in the high school they should not be doing community service. Some reasons they should not do community service is that they have jobs, they have sports to do or they want to hand out with there friends. In my opinion i so not think kids should do community service.
