The Face on Mars was at first just a shadowy likeness of a human face. Yet, as we focused more and more into the Face the more superficial it became. Is it a Martian? Is there life on Mars?

Well, from the evidence given, it is very likely that the superstions are false, and the Face is just a landform.

The Face was captured again on April 5, 1998 by the MOC which gave a sharper photo. That alone was enough proof to show that the Face is just a landform. Even though it was very cloudy around Mars around that time, it would still be difficult to pass over the Face. The MOC scans over the planet with narrow 2.5 km-wide strips which would make it very hard to miss over the Face.

Lastly on April 8, 2001 NASA captured an extraordinarry photo of the Face. It was a cloudless, summer day which squelched all objections of it being too cloudy around Cydonia to capture a good photo. Each pixel in the photo spans 1.56 meters, whereas the best photo in 1976 only had 43 meters per pixel. The photo was so spectacular that you could zoom in 3 times the pixels size, so even if there were life, small shacks, or pyramids on Mars, you'd be able to see them.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landform. the 2001 photo gives enough evidence that even if there were life or monuments on Mars you would be able to see them. The photo in 1998 was also a good photo, so good that it would be hard to even miss over the Face. Also, even if there were life on Mars NASA would have no reason to hide it, it would help their company more than it would be a detriment to it. The article states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West."
