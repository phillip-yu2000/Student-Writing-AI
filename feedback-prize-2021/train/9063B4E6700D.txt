Aliens on Mars making a huge monument is very contarversial. Some people think that the monument is made by aliens but some people think it is man made. But now the "face on mars" is being photo graghed with better detail than ever. The "face on mars" is natural.

NASA has sent spacecraft to observe the surface of mars and the first on they sent was Viking 1 took pictures of the surface of mars and there seemed to be a face and they thought that there was an anceint civilaztion that built it. Later on they sent another spacecraft to take even better detail of the surface of mars. And in 1998 they got even more detial than in 1976. Then in 2001 They took pictures of it again and with even more resolution.

Others say that it looks like something made by somehing esle other than humans or nature. And they say it has the look of being man made. But it has been photograghed numorous time and with even better detail and it look like it was made by nature not some other beings. It also states in the artical "That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars."

The "face on mars is natural". There is more evidence of it being natural than being made by aliens. The photos are better and they clearly show that it is just a rock formation.
