TEACHER_NAME:

I think it would be a great idea to have a policy like this. It would encourage students to make better grades, have a smarter athletic team, and learn more.

I know many children who are failing at our school . Also, many of our kids here at SCHOOL_NAME play some type of sport. If we have so many kids failing, and they are still able to play sports, what kind of discipline is that? None. Kids would be more influenced to make better grades if they knew they were going to give up playing time for the sport they loved.

Secondly , we would have a smarter athletic team. Kids always worry about their grades & if they're going to be able to finish homework when their coaches have them at late practices. With this policy, we wouldn't have to worry about that anymore because if they have a B average, they must be smart! No more worrying about if your failing athlete is going to finish their homework, they will have enough time to go home and study now.

Those who need special attention in school now have the time to go get help whenever they need it. So they are now able to learn more. They don't have to worry now, just study.

As you can see, I totally agree with your idea of the new schoolwide policy. I think it would be great in effect to our students because , it would encourage students to make better grades, we would have smarter athletic programs, and we would provide more education for those who need it.

Your student,
