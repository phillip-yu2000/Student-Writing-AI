Dear principle,

You think that we should have to have a letter B grade or above to play sports. I do not agree with you because below a B is not failing. Below a letter C grade is failing and UIL states that you must be passing to play, and a C is passing you do not have the authority to do that. It is okay to have a C

because some kids might not be very good at school, they have other activities that consume most of there time and again you do not have permission to make this a rule.

Some of us have many other activities outside of school that we are occupied with and take a lot of time and effort. Some nights I do not get home from Boy Scouts until 9:00 and I will be tired, go to bed, and forget to study. The next day I might have a test that fail because I did not study and it will hurt my grade. I should still be able to play because I could get a better grade on the next assessment and it will bring my grade up.

Some of kids who play sports a lot are not very good at school and they average a C in most classes. I can see why you would want to motivate these few to bring their grades up but you can not do that by saying they can not play unless they have a B. UIL says they must have a C or above at report card time to be able to play, not just doing bad on a test.

In conclusion you should be able to a C average or above to play sports because some kids might have other time consuming activities and others are not willing to put forth the effort to get a B. That is why I disagree with you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
