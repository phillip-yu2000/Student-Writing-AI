Do you think students should be able to attend classes from home? Some people believe students would benefit while other people believe students would not benefit. I believe students would not benefit because they would miss out on school activities, the experience, and lacking social skills.

However not everyone agrees with this position. They believe students would benefit of health problems, fewer students, and not having to worry about what to wear. Although these are great facts, it all depends on what would be better for your own education.

First, students would not benefit because they would miss out on school activities. For example, when you write your collage resumes you wouldn't have any clubs or sports to put down. This would make it look like you're a boring, lazy, and unsocial person.

Also, another reason is the experience. During my three years of public high school, I have enjoyed it. Mostly every quarter we get to have school dances and pep rally's. Students may participate in pep rally if they would like. Whither you like football, basketball or any other sport and you're a responsible person you can join a team.

The final reason is lacking social skills. If you do attend classes from home, you wouldn't get to make friends. This would be a disadvantage because you wouldn't get to work in groups all your work will be done alone. Working in groups is helpful for many reasons. Other student can help you when you're stuck or have a question. Overall this would be a bad thing.

In conclusion, I believe students would not benefit. But it's all based on what will be conferrable for you to get the best education.
