Driverless cars would be a helpful tool in the future. They could help us get things done while heading somewhere far away. It could get rid of driver errors. Drunk driving could even by stop by this new product. This is why the driverless car should be allowd.

First off the time you use to drive all the way down to Florida is about 12-18 hours. Lets say someone is going there for their job that 12-18 hours could be used for all sorts of things like making up for you job while your away or just finshing a project you did for this meet. It would be a great way to use your time instead of having to drive. This could be an amazing break through for somepeople who have to travel many times for their job.

Secondly, if we have only driverless cars all driving they would know how to react to each other. This inturn would get rid of driver error such as drivers getting angry at each other. Another example would be cars speeding past each other, which cause recks. Driverless cars could bring down the death toll from car crashs every year by getting rid of driver error.

Finally, a big problem today is drunk driving. If we had driverless cars the drunk drivers would never have to touch the wheel making the roads safer. The car its self could never get drug or slow down its reaction speed making it safer than with someone above .08. This could also bring down the death toll, for drunk driving crashs every year.

These are all reasons i believe that we could be better of with driverless cars. It may cost more and their might be problems at first but in the long run it could save many of lives. Many states do not trust it, but i believe after they make they cars smarter they will see that they can driver better than any human ever could. Saving lives for many people which if worth it.
