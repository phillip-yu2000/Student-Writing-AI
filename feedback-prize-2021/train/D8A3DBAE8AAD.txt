"I have things to do!","I don't even want to be here!","Mom you know I hate sports!", are all things i have said. Do you like sports? i don't like sports or getting my picture taken. I would rather spend my after noon singing along to my favorite songs or gaming. I disagree with evere student having to take an extra curricular activity because I have to take care 4 cats, take care of my mom, and collect my little sister from school.

First, I have to take care of my cats. When I get home I have to clean their litter boxes and get them fresh food and water. I have to be home becuase if I am not 2 of my newer cats will attack my older cat. I also have to play with them and their toys so they loose energy. I do this so that my mom and dad can sleep.

Next, I need to take care of my mom. my mom is really sick all the time. She can't even really eat right now. I try to help her eat. I help my mom clean. Me and my mom make art. I can't leave my mom alone for to long.

Third, I have to get my little sister from school. Direcly after I get off the bus i have to get my litter sister from school. Its a 15 minute walk to the scool and back the way we came. In total its a 30 minute walk. Sometimes longer because we stop and get food.

In conclusion, not every one can stay back after school. The time or date may not match up with most peoples scheduals. You never know what every ones doing. Do you agree or disagree with me? Do you like to stay after school?
