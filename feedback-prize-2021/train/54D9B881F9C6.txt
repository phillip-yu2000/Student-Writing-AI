Dear principal,

I think doing community service would be great. The reason why is because people who litter and don't pick there trash, up animals can get tangled in it. It also gets into our ocean and fish and other sea life creatures dies. The stuff that gets into the ocean and forest animals eat it, and the could get poisoned, and they could also die.

It is also important to do community service because you can get rewarded like helping the elderly. It is also important because your doing good to your community, and helping others and animals. Cleaning up litter can do a lot of things to your community . For example people can come all over the United States to see the most cleanest community, and the town or city population will grow.

The last good reason is that you could clean up your parks and your state parks. It is a very important reason you should keep your parks clean because people would not want to come to a park that is all dirty and probably stinky. Also people would not want to come to a state park that is popular that is gross and full of trash. So people has to clean up every where to keep states or probably the United states clean. One more thing it also important to clean up lakes and polluted areas so when people swim no bad stuff would happen.

Sincerely ,
