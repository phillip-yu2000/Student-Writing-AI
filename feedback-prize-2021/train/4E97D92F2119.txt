Dear state senator,

I belive that the people of this nation should be able to vote for who they want to be president directly. So, I belive that we should disgaurd the old Eletoral College and switch it with election by popular vote. The reason why i would like to change it is becuse the people of this country should be able to choose their president, not a canidate to choose for them. I understand that it may be esair to have a select number of people choose the president. Rather than going to each stae and couting each of the indvidual votes, but this country is ran by the people and their dicisons on how to move foward. Chosing the right man to put in office is the first part in moving in that direction.

The  way that the Electoral vote is flawed is that the people don't get to directly choose thier president. The elected candiates  could go angainst the will of the people and vote for whom ever they please. Another way that it is flawed is that if the celcted candiates tie, the right to vote gets handed down to the house of representatives. The people have no say in this and the repersntives can vote for whom ever they please. This is a very unfair procses that the people have to grow through to choose the leader of thier country.

This prosess may esair but it is undemocratic. The people should have the right to directly choose thier president. The winner-take- all method is the wrong way to obatin electoral votes. It should be counted on indivual votes so it can have a less of an impact. These are the reasons why electoral votwes are flawed and should be the people that choose thier president.
