Do you want to help other countries? In the process you can see, and take a tour through the ruins of great places. That's what Luke in, "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" did. More people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

If you join you would be helping countries after World War II from all over the world by, bringing them horses, young cows, and mules. You can help nations rebuild since World War II destroyed a lot of land. I know this because in the text it said, To help these countries recover their food, supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.) Some may argue that sending all of the animals overseas might reduce the animal population in that country that is sending them away. But really we have enough cattle in places like America.

Also joining will give you an oppurtunity to visit all of the ancient ruins of a great city. The author wrote, "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special." On the other hand people will say that they have already seen the Acropolis or China or Europe, but the countries\cities are fascinating. I think you could see them again.

Last it teaches you how to be hard working. I know this because, On the second trip Luke served as a watchman. His job was to check on all of the animals every hour, One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. It teaches you something, but sometimes it's dangerous. Luke almost flew overboard into the dark Atlantic.

That was my persuasive essay, do you want to join the program now? I still think more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that seeing the Acropolis in Greece would be amazing as well as seeing China and all of its great places.
