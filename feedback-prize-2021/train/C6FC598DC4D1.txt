To the principal,

As a student, I think the requirement for all students to do community service is would be unfair to some fellow students. Because it would interfere with most of our personal time, and whenever I think of community service I associate it as if we had done something wrong and was being punished.

Instead, I think you should make it into an optional thing to where you hand out permission slips and make it into a fun field trip. Like go to community park and walk around picking up trash while learning about how the park came to be or something like that.

No one wants to be forced to do something they don't want to do, and if we were forced to do community service,

there might be problems with students.

So, as a student, I think the requirement for all students to do community service is would be unfair to some fellow students. Because it would interfere with most of our personal time.
