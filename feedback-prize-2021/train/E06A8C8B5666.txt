I think that a summer project should really be designed by the teacher. However, there could be a exception if the student had a good idea. I do think that this would be a good idea, it would help keep students out of trouble and keep them from getting bored. If the projects are designed by the teacher then they will be alot better.

However if the teacher does come up with the project, there should be a few diffrent choices for the students to pick. For one if the students are able to find one that they have intrest in, the project will be alot better for both the teacher and the student. If the student has intrest in the project, it will actually be benifital to them.

So say the student came up with a good idea for a summer project. I think that the teacher should allow for he or she to proceed in that project and maybe let the idea become more open to the other students. If the student comes up with a project they would like to do, well most likely they would have good intrest in the project and actually get something out of it.

Me personaly, I would probably come up with my own idea for a project. Because, most likely if I come up with something I want to wright about, then I will most likely sucssed and do well. For one, I will have plenty of ideas and will actually be interested in doing it.

So i think, this would be a good idea if the teachers came up with the ideas. But, like i said before if the students have a good idea they come up with, then it needs to be given and approved by the teacher. Because, if the students come up with the ideas and there not teacher approved, then who knows what it will be about. Please, consider thinking about my idea.
