When most people are stuck, whether it be in a video game or in real life scenarios, they need to ask for advice. Advice is very helpful in guiding someone along their way, or help them make decisions. Most people also ask multiple people for advice. I believe that asking multiple people for advice is good because you get to know the consequences, you know a little bit more and if you get opposing viewpoints, you can use those to think about your decision.

Knowing the consequences of your actions can be a huge advantage, as every action has its consequence. Many people tend to ignore the consequences to their actions and end up in bad predicaments. When you ask for advice, you are also learning about your actions, and how your choices impact your life. Hopefully, knowing the pros and cons can help with choices and problems.

Knowledge is power, and the more you have, the better. Sometimes, when you get advice from just one person, they tend to leave out important details. When we get advice from multiple people, other people might cover the topics that the other did not. Occasionally, that information would be crucial, and could have prevented disasters, so you have to ask multiple people when getting advice.

One part of making choices involve weighing out the pros and cons. If you get advice from two people with opposing viewpoints, you could get more information about the consequences. With that information, you can consider the choice more and make the right decision. Decisions are hard, but asking multiple people can be helpful.

Advice can be more helpful if you take it from more than one person and interpret it right. In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice is beneficial, because you get to know the consequences, you know a little bit more about the problem, and if you get opposing viewpoints, you can use those to think about your decision.Â
