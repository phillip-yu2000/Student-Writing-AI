Let's be honest school is or can be stressful for some students mainly because you have two or more classes to attend which can be a hassle especially if you have to be carrying books around all day. Not to mention the stress of having to take tests, finals, and dealing with homework, which also requires time limits that can cause more stress to the individual it can also make their anxiety level rise up, with that being said the anxiety and stress buildup would probably result in a mental breakdown that can result to serious medical conditions or possible mental health problems.

Nevertheless students would benefit a lot by attending classes from home, for example less stress and anxiety will weigh on them because they would be in the comfort of their homes with less noise that could potentially distract the individual, the students can also work at their own pace without rushing or fumbling around trying to beat their deadlines and it will also be cost efficient especially for the individuals who are attending college. They wouldn't need to stress or worry about paying student loans, debts, or need to require two or more jobs to receive enough money to pay for their classes it would also make the student more responsible and give them better time management skills by making sure they complete all there work and turn it in on time.

Furthermore, another way long distance schooling would be beneficial is the fact that a lot of students are shy or very quiet. Online schooling and video conferencing would provide more confidence and less secrecy when it comes to asking or answering a question, without the individual worrying about other students laughing at him or her or being silently judged, it will also boost self esteem and give a sense of accomplishment by being able to ask a question without feeling a sense of embarrassment or being mocked or shamed by other classmates it will also give the individual more confidence by asking more questions and require more help from his or her teacher that will help the student in the long run.

Therefore, long distance schooling would be beneficial because it will provide less stress to the students and make them feel more comfortable with there surroundings, it would also make the students more responsible and they would have better time management skills by making sure everything is finished, complete and turned in on time it will also help the students build self esteem and confidence that they will take and use with them along the way and it will help them become successful in life.
