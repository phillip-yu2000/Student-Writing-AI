Are you looking for a job that gose oversaes? Then I have the job for you! You should come join me in the Seagoing Cowboys progam. We go over seas to all kinds of countries. Here is some information you might need before you decide to join.

This isn't one of those jobs you hate and want to get over with and go home. It is really fun and a lot of responsibility. Something that is really cool and I love to do, is go sight seeing when we drop of the animals. Since we go a lot of places to give animals away, there is a lot of things to see. That is something that is always fun, if you love going to foreign countries to see things. Like the time I went Crete and and explored an excavated castle.

You are always on a boat, so you can't be scared of boats or the water and you can't be a person who gets sea sick a lot. That's not the only thing you have to mind, though. Because we are taking animals overseas, there is alot of animals to take care of, like 335 horses, plus we have to have enough hay and oats to feed them. It can be a stinky, dirty job, too. You don't really have to be good with animals, though. You just have be good at remembering and giving them food and water up to three times a day. But it would also help if you were good with them, so then you wouldn't scare them. If you are strong then great! We would need you to carry a lot of bahles of hay and bags of oats onto the boat.

Just think, sailing all around the world! You can see places and go to places that you've always wanted to go. If you're thinking like, oh! They don't need me. They've already got enough hands on board!, then you better think again. We can always use a new person to help us.
