Dear TEACHER_NAME,

This change could help or hurt the school. Depending on the various side effects. I'm not sure exactly what my opinion is. This could boost the grades of students to a B' average witch will boost the overall school grades or bring them down and cause a weight problem for the people who don't play out side at home.

If you did make these changes it could make the average C student pull their grade up to a B average depending on wether or not that student participates in school Activities / Sports etc. This makes the overall school report card better than C average and most students' parents would be proud. Causing the school's ratings to shoot through the roof.

It could also make the average students' grades drop drastically causing a serious problem and parents would become very upset. Also including the school report card to drop and have the side effect of a minor weight problem with in the school. Inclining child hood obesity witch is a world wide problem in today's

America.

These are the two out comes of this possible policy change so its a hit or miss thing. I would try it, but if it were to have a bad side effect then change the policy quickly because we don't want any bad reviews for our school and if it were a success then it improves the schools ratings witch would help a lot.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME,
