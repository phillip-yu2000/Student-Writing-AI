This new technology can really figure out if youre happy, sad, fearful, mad, or confuse. I would really enjoy this new technolgy. I even think that we should have it in our classrooms. This can really change us in school and better educated.

I believe that we should have the Facial Action Coding System. If we were in our classroom, the teacher can't sometimes tell if your really happy, bored, mad, or sad. If you learning something in class and the computer shows that youre bored. The can help you get motivated and try harder on your homework. Sometimes students comes in and just smile, but really you don't really know how they feeling. On paragraph 8, its says that sometimes there face isn't saying the truth becuase deep down there hurn or just lying. There trying to hide there emotions. The teachers really need to how they feeling. Like in paragraph 6, it says that it can detect if a students was feeling bored, sad, fearful. What if they were depressed or mad at something? We have to do something and help them. This can really benifent our school and our students.

I would really value this computer system, becuase it can help our education better and more efficient. We need to know how there feeling what can we do to help them. I would really recommend this in our school. Facial Action Coding System would really benefient our classroom.
