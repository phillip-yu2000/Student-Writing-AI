The program called Seagoing Cowboys will allow you to experience adventure and vist many unique places. The reason I think this is because he gets to deal with horses every day, which I would love to do that, and when he stops he gets to travel around the cities.

Luke says he gets to care for the animals while he´s crossing oceans. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalles had to be cleand too.

He says he got the benefit of seeing Europe and China. ¨But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,¨ he says. ¨So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.¨ Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

This proves to me that the Seagoing Cowboys program trip would be fun. Please consiter this idea.
