Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand that you are thinking of a new cell phone policy for the school. If I had the opportunity to choose between Policy 1 and Policy 2, I would choose Policy 2.

Cell phones are such a huge distraction to teenagers.

Students would just ignore Policy 1's rule of having it turned off in class just like they would ignore Policy 2.

I would go with Policy 2 because cell phones distract teens more then anything. Most kids wouldn't get their work done because they would be too busy with their phones. Teachers would probably get upset because when the kids are texting instead of doing their work, they aren't learning. Teachers always say teach because they love to see us learn. They deserve our respect and us texting in class would be rude.

I know that you are a very intelligent man TEACHER_NAME

and I believe you will choose wisely. However, for the sake of my fellow classmates and my education, I advise you to go with Policy 2. Cell phones are the number one distraction for teenagers. Having them at school would interfere with our work.

School is a learning place, not a social event.
