Ever since they were invented, there has always been a drive to improve cars. Whether making them faster or more fuel efficient, humans have always wanted to make them better. Hollywood movies have always made a big spectacle of cars, as they could make them do whatever they want in the fake films. Some of those hollywood ideas are no longer just ideas or wishes, because many automotive companies are working on the development of cars that can drive themselves. With this development, the cars would be safer and more efficient.

From day one cars have always had a risk factor, from the high speeds, to the reckless drivers. With the development of self driving cars, most of these factors would just dissapear. There would be no need to worry about reckless drivers or dangerous speeds, as there would be no drivers and the car could maintain a safe speed. Having self-driving cars would offer plentiful benefits. First off it was already metioned there would be no reckless drivers. Plus, the cars would have faster response times to accidents and obstacles. There would also be less accidents as the cars could apply brakes before a driver could.

When these smart cars are introduced to the public, traffic would be much more efficient. The cars would run on less gas, as the driver would consume more with their driving techniques. Also, the cars could find the fastest route to wherever the passenger was wanting to go. Plus, the cars would be able to move smartly and help keep traffic moving to avoid the enormous traffic back ups that usually occur.

The development of driverless cars are an inevitability. They wil be out on the road and keeping people safe. They will react faster and avoid collisions, saving numerous lives. Cars are still being improved today, but ones capable of driving without a human at the wheel are coming sooner than you think.
