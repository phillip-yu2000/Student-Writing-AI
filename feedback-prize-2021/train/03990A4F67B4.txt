I do not think that changing the policy would be fare. I don't think so because some kids are in honors or advanced classes and they get C' s even though they try really hard. Also if your in honors classes you get a high school credit because your taking a high school class. So you are going to want to stay in that class if you have just a C wich is still a passing grade! But if your in a hard high school course you shouldn't be excluded from physical activities for having a C average. Even if your in just advanced classes and you try your best but your best just isn't good enough. That policy should just go for kids who are in normal classes and behave badly, for kids who have gotten referrals, and that are just plain trouble makers. That is when they should check grades because if your bad in class you are bad everywhere, and you need to be responsible and trust worthy to be in sports. That is why i think only advanced and honors kids should be in physical activities with a C average or lower.
