I feel that the driverless cars are a great idea. It shows how much we are developing and what we can do, and also make the roads much safer. There are alot of positive aspects of the driverless cars. This could lead to many other great things!

The passage says,"Sensors cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine.'' This is a positive aspect because this will help people not get into wrecks. Alot of people and their children would be safer because of these sensors. The sensors and computer hardware are leading to more cars that can do other task by theirselves.

The driverless car has multiple sensors. The sensors will tell you if its getting to close to something. That would make it harder for people to get into wrecks. The car uses laser beams to form a 3-D model of the cars surroundings, so the car knows when to stop when it comes to close to an object.

Driverless cars have touch sensors to make sure the human has their hands on the wheel at all times. This is a very positive aspect, because if the car malfunctions then the human can take over right away and still be safe. The cars alos notify the driver when it requires the human driver's skills. This makes it even harder to get into a wreck.

There are alot of positive aspects of the driverless cars. All of the aspects are very positive and safe. Imagine not having to worry about everyone else on the roads and feeling completley comfortable in your own driverless car. These cars will make the world more developed and make our everyday lives safer.
