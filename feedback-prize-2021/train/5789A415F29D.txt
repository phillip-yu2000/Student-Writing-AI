When students are on summer break they want to have fun. Some schools require students to do projects to make sure the students are still learning during the break. The summer projects should be student-designed because students can do topics they have better understanding of and students can learn more information on the topics they are doing.

Students hate having school work during summer break, but if the students decide on what topic they wanna do it can be easier and fun. The projects can be on topics students really understand and actually have interest in. For example, what if the student loves the solar system they can do a topic on that and really understand it because they find interest in it. Students that understand there topics have a better chance at showing their teachers that they really understand and they know what they are doing. The more students understand the better the project will come out.

While doing projects sometimes students need to look up information on topics they are doing. Students can learn more information on that topic. However , the teacher teaches students information about that topic, but what if they look up a topic and find more information than what the teacher told them . The students are finding out more information that can possibly help them in the long run. For example, say you picked how plants are developed, but your teacher gives you information about how plants are developed, but you find better information and its accurate.

Some students think that projects during the summer are boring, but they can actually help them understand the topics more and can become really fun . School projects during the summer time may not be fun, but can really benefit students in the end and actually help them. These projects can be very helpful and can even prepare students for the next school year. If more schools allow students to design their own projects , then the more the students will actually complete them.
