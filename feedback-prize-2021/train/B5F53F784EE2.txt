Dear Senator:

Many people say that electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. Even though I agree with this position in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Despite the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; I belive that retaining the Electoral College is what is best for non-liberal or conservative reasons.

The Elecotoral College avoids the problem of electons in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For instance, one of my sources told me" In 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

The Elecotoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, another source" In 2012, the popular vote was very close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes." Large states gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

I do hope that you agree with me when i say that we should retain the Elecotoral College.       Â
