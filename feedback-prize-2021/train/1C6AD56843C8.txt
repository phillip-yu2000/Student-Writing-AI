Dear Principal,

My view on the possible policy change is that its not a good idea and shouldn't be done.

I think that the policy should not change. I think that it would be unfair to not let a student play in sports or other activities if they don't have at least a B average. Most of the students in the grade only have C averages. A lot of the students love sports and if that is taken away from them then they might even do worse in school. If they don't have something to look forward to doing. Then they'll have lake of motivation if they can't get to a B and play something they enjoy. They come to hate school even more. They might stop doing all

Then there would be lots of failing grades through out the school.

I suggest if you do change the policy to have a certain grade, to change it to have at least a C. there for the students most student wont have to try to boost their grade past what it normally is.

But they'll have to maintain it. If they don't and go down with their average. Than you can take them out of a sport until they can get it back up.
