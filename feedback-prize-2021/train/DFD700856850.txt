Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that the policy should be policy 1: "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time." I think that because then students would not be as tempted to sneak there phones in class and text. It would allow them to say what they need to, to who ever they are talking to at the time they are allowed to have their phones out. Then they would not wont to take their phones out during class to text that person as much.

Plus, what if there is an emergency at school? The students could get their phones out at the right time they need to, to call there parents or gardens. This would make it easer for the staff at the school so they wouldn't have to call all the kid's parents or gardens. You never now when there might be an emergency at the school and you would have to call the parents. So the students having cell phone would be able to get a hold of their parents easer.

Those are some of the reasons I think you should change the policy to policy 1: "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time." So that students wont be as tempted to take their phones out in class and incase there is an emergency at the school an you need to get a hole of the parents of that child easer.

Senserly yours,
