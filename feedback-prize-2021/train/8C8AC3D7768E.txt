Aliens may or may not be real, but if they were they could not make this. I know this is just a natural landform. Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 "What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West." Then to prove it even more it says this. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar." So that just said that these "faces" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.

These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.
