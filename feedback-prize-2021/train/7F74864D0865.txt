Dear state senator, the people of the state want to choose the president by a popular vote of qualified for what president they want.

The electoral vote college is more like a process that mean it's of 538 electors , if more than the half vote for the president he is elected, but the people of the state want the popular vote because they want to choose their president.

Each candidate going for president has hes own group and the people of the states choose want side they want to be in, and what candidate they want to choose to be the next president, every 4 years they choose new candidates and presidents, in the electoral college the citizens dont vote for their president they vote for the ones who going to be the electors.

The electoral college is outdated, unfair,and is not democratic, thats why the people of the state want the popular vote.

thank you for your time to read this letter.
