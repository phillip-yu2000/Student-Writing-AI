Would you like to have a president by popular vote or by the electoral collage choosing the preident. Im sure i would love to pick my own president. being an american is a privalage that most people in the world would die for, the land of brave and free. people come to asmerica to be able to be free. picking a president and voting is a privage. to be able to have popular vote is so that the american citizens can pick there own preisend by popular vote, not the electoral collage's vote. according to the article Al Gore, was runnoing for presidnt and got the most populare vote but not the most electoral votes. The majority of the citizens of the united states chose Al Gore as presient but the electoral collgae took that away.

As stated before the electoral collage chooses the presidents not the american people.

In conclusion the electoral collage sholiuld be abolished
