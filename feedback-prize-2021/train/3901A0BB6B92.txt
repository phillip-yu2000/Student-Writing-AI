Dear, Mrs. Principal

It has come to my attention that you are considering changing the needed grade average to be eligible to play sports from a C average to a B average. I encourage you to do so. For I have several reasons why I think you should do this. One is that the reason why schools have sports programs is to mainly encourage the player to improve on their grades so they can play. But, by letting some players who will do the minimum just so they can play pretty much goes against the concept of using sports as motivation to advance in school. That is of my reasons why I think you should change the eligibility. Another is that United States schools are falling behind with other competing countries in education. So by increasing the eligibility to a B average students of this school will have more chances of succeeding academically in school. Kids need to understand that a education is much more important than being able to play.

Although sports can get you scholarships to college you also need the good grades to. Or that talent of being the "star football player" or the "talented baseball player" won't matter. That is why highly encourage you to change the eligibility from a C average to a A average. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you highly consider my opinion.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
