If my school princible decided to include activities to the school that students have to participate in one of them I would disagree. I would disagree because some children might not have the energy or time to do all of these activities and should mostly focus on school work. I would also disagree on this claim because how much money that the school has to use to make these activities happen for every student.

To support my first reason some children have to keep having to learn because if they do sports they would have less time to do anything school related and have to give up some quality sleep time and use some of it up on doing school work so it ruins their sleep schedule. To help my second claim on how this will affect the schools buget and to help support my second claim on how the school shouldn't make students do activites and cut school buget is how much the school has to spend. For an example if there was a cooking activity the school will have to use some of the school money to buy all the ingrdients to make all the food that the children need to do. For my final example the student council some of the children might not like to do it and they will think that it is boring and really wouldn't want to do it and will stop doing it.

As I stated if my school princible would suggest something as doing activites in school I would disagree due to the fact that it would be either long and waste students time that they could have used to finish up school work that would have been more important than what they were usally doing. Sometimes it will be the school buget and maybe they the school will not have enough to afford all what they said they would get or it might be that children will not like some of the activities which take and also waste time if they would not like it. If my school princible would make students do a required schhol activity I would disagree on that claim or idea.
