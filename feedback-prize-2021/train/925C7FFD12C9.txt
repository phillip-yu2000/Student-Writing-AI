I am for the value of this technology to read students' emotions. I have a reason to support this opinion.

To begin with, this could be used to ditermine the hidden human emotions. For instance, when I am having a presentation about a specefic topic, but I cannot know the audence's true feelings against me because people usually flatter and do not show their real thoughts. However, by using this technology, I can figure out if mine was good enough or not from the data.

In other hand, I believe this has to be limited to protect individual human rights. For example, what if I could read emotions that are shown by folks, they would be bewildered because they have their own private feelings. This might become a big and grave issue later.

As a conclusion, technology is much smarter and more intellegent, but does not have abilities to control human rights. Just because that can decearn the emotion rate, does not mean that can know the real problem beyond this technology.
