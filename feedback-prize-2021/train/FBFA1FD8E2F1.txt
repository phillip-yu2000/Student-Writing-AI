Policy 1:

Dear Principal,

I strongly believe that students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch or any other free times. Lets say they needed something from home and they already have their phone with them, then they should be able to contact their parent or guardian if needed. I believe that it's always good to have a cell phone with you in case of emergency. Cell phones can be useful just not in class. Students could get help from other students if they needed it. What if he or she couldn't find the answer to the problem he or she was on; he or she could call or text each other to see if they have an answer. If teachers take away the cell phones from students who have them out during free time then that probably encourages them to have them during class time. Not free time or lunch. I'm feeling very ill around lunch time and I need to get a-hold of my mom or dad, so I text them to see if they're available to come and pick me up. And if they are available to do so then I'll wait in the nurses office so I know I'll be safe and that they know where I'm at. Cell phones aren't always a bad thing. They give us a chance to use our piece of technology that was created. We can communicate on them when needed. I also believe that using cell phones before or after school hours are ok. It's still free time and it's not considered school hours. We haven't officially started or ended school. Cell phones can be used as reminders. One time I had a friend who didn't know we had an honor society meeting and I texted her to remind her what was going on today at school. She took it out to read it and it had got taken away. It wasn't even time for school to begin. I was just reminding her and she got the consequence of it. I don't think it's all that fare. So in the end, I strongly believe that cell phones should be accepted during free time or and at lunch.

Sincerely,
