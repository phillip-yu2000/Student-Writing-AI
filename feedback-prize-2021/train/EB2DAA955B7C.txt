If people would stop using cars places would'nt be that dirty in the air it's polluting the air and it wouldn't be that dirty. An example would be in a german suburb people kind of stop using cars and started to walk and use bikes. People would be more healthy and active if cars didn't exist. For me I don't like cars in general. But yeah people praise cars just because they are lazy and like using cars to get places faster. Also people waist a lot of money for a car that would last along three years. Like it says in article 1,paragragh 3 "as a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars...". Which means that those families do not own cars because they like to walk or use bikes.

Like in paris they banned using cars because the air was so polluted and dirty not even breathable for people. So they fined people that had their cars outside. So basically what they made people do is walk and use bikes. In article 2, paragragh 1 its says "paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city". What the author is saying is that people were using cars to much and the smoke would pollute the air. They almost held the record for the most polluted air so they partially banned using cars.

In conclusion, paris was making a good decision to ban cars or if not you'll get banned.
