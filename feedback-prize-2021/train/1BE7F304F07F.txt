Dear Principal,

I understand that community service is a, sometimes difficult task. Some students may say that they do not have time for community service. It takes out too much time for kids to do what they need or want to do. I say that is wrong, students should give at least one hour of community service each week. Such as give canned food to homeless shelters. Or get together with a group of your friends and pick up trash on the side of the road. Or go to the beach and pick up all the trash in the water and in the sand.

I think that every Friday students should have to give at least thirty minutes of community service to there school campus. Students should go out to the sports fields on campus with some friends and pick up trash. Or maybe in the school help the custodians or the cleaning staff clean up around the school.

All of this cleaning and community service should happen because, our schools are huge and a couple of custodians cant clean up the whole school in one night. Then right after that go outside and pick up all that trash. Then after all that cleaning its just going to get messy and dirty again the very next day.

That is why we should have community service for all the kids at least an hour a week to help our school's stay clean and last longer for a healthier and safer school environment.
