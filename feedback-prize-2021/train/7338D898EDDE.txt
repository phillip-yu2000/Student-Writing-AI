I disagree with driverless cars. Driverless cars are not a very smart idea, just becuase Google has made driverless cars since 2009 they have drove over half million miles without a crash, but Google cars are not driverless they alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of a driveway or dealing with something bad happing near them. The Google driverless cars are not so driverless.

My thoughts about the driverless cars is what happens if the car crashes whos fault is it the person in the car or the manufacturer? What if we get driverless cars what is going to happen to insurance for cars insurance people will lose money and if the car did crash its more money out of your pocket to fix it insted the insurance people having to deal with some payment. Car manufactures like BMW, Audi, ext. have made more of there cars safe for people and I do not think making them driverless would be safe. What if the car goes nuts and the driver has no control?

I feel that if we get driverless cars more people will lose there life then without them. We can not always relie on driverless cars or the technology becuase one day we will not have it. So I think we need to just drop the whole driverless cars and work more on safety.
