Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that it is a great idea for kids to help other kids by doing community service .It is even better when they volunteer themselves. That shows that those kids care about their peers and want to do something positive for the community. On the other hand, some kids think that community service takes too long. I'm not judging because some activities do in my opinion take to long. Maybe I could suggest some other things that those kids could do. For an example, some kids could recycle or not leave the water on while not in use. My aunt use to recycle cans. I never really thought about it but now i understand that, that was a good idea. Instead of throwing those cans in the trash, she was actually saving materials. I also learned last year about my carbon foot print. I learned that leaving water on, leaving the lights on, and using the air conditioner could be replaced with a better idea. Plus leaving the water on and lights on when not needed is wasteful and instead of having the air conditioner on, an open window would probably work. Not only does it run up a monthly bill. Its just wasteful when not being used. Those are just some examples of ways kids could do good by not doing a lot. Now that I think about it. i once sat down at the dinner table and ate half of my food and was planning on throwing the rest away, but my mother stopped me. She explained that some kids, my age and younger don't get to eat. So I should be thankful and not throw away food that some other child could be gladly enjoying. In conclusion, the moral of this letter is that i feel that some kids shouldn't get discouraged from doing something for their community. It doesn't have to be major, like painting a house. Instead it could be something simply, like not littering.

Yours Truly,
