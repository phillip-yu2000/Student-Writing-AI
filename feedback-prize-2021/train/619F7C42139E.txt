Why do you think teachers should be allowed to design summer projects?

Teachers should be allowed to design projects during the summer for students. My reasons for why teachers should be allowed are that teachers know what they want their assignment to be about. Another is that it can be hard for students to come up with something on their own. Finally Students might forget about and not do it at all.

Teachers who design their projects for students knows how they want the students to do their assignment.

Teachers that design their projects can be easier for students because they will know what to do and how to do it.

Teachers that design the project can me more professional becasue students may make a mistake and not know what they missed and can look to see and fix it.

Students who are busy during the summertime might be harder for them to come up with a projects on their own. They may have jobs that wre very stressful for them to even think about a project. Students can have summer school and might have work from other teachers to complete.

Students having to do assignments on thier own can be bad. Students might not even do thier assignment because it is summer break and wanna have fun with thier friends. Students who might forget about the assignment can be busy during the summer they can be traveling with famliy or even having a job.

Teachers should be allowed to design summer projects for students because its easier for students to get it done faster.
