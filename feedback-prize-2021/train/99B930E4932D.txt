The shadows are giveing the illusions of a face. And the Mars Orbiter Camera found out that it is a land form.

This "Face" is just a land form wy can you guys not see that. It looks and has the same formations as the rock formation in Idaho. They both are the same hight and they both look alike. Don't forget that it looks alot like butte or mesa.

This "Face" was confurmed A few days later after NASA unveiled the image for all to see. "The caption noted a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."

Lets not forget that the "Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." "Revealing... a natural landform." There is no alien monument after all.

There is no alien artifact because it has the same apperenses than the butt or mesa in Idaho. And the shodows are giving the illusion of a face. And the Mars Orbiter found that it was a natural landform.
