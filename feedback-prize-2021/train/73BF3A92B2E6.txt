Texting and Driving

In these times, cell phones and the internet have been ingrained into every aspect of our lives. One particularly dangerous aspect is the operation of a motorized vehicle. Use of a telephone to any extent while driving has been prohibited in Georgia. Rightfully so, considering the overwhelming number of car accidents caused by a person using a cell phone behind the wheel. Drivers should not be allowed to use a cell phone while operating a motorized vehicle.

No human is able to multitask and do each task to the best of their ability. So why should people be allowed to do two tasks that require a vast amount of focus to complete at the same time? It is a recipe for disaster and the proof is everything from television commercials to cold, hard statistics. According to The National Safety Council, use of a cell phone while driving caused 1.6 million car crashes each year. That means 1 in 4 car accidents were caused by texting and driving.

Georgia has implemented a new law called The Hands Free law, stating that it is illegal to have your cell phone in your hand while driving. This has seen a tremendous decline in car accidents since the passing of this law. This only further proves that texting and driving is deadly and leads to immense amounts of casualties.

Texting and driving should continue to be outlawed, and the hands free law should be implemented all over the country. It saves lives and decreases the amount of annual car crashes. No one should have a phone in their hand when in the driver's seat of a moving vehicle. It endangers their life, as well as the lives of everyone else on the road. Texting and driving is bad.
