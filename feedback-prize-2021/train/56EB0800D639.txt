The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. This is not a face created by aliens. The picture taking in 1998 revealed it was a natural landform, if NASA would have said it was aliens they would recieve more funding, however they said it was an illusion of a face, and in 2001 the picture taken clearly shows that it is a natural landform.

In 1998 NASA captured a pictue of the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. The picture revealed that it was just a natural landform, just like NASA had said in 1976. Also, when the original picture was taken in 1976 it was revealed to be an illusion of a face by NASA. If NASA chose to call the landform work done by aliens, they would recieve more funding. However, NASA was very truthful in there fundings and they didn't have any reason besides the truth to say it was a natural landform. Finally, the clearest pictue of it taken in 2001 clearly shows a natural landform that couldn't be mistaken for anything else. A quote from the article is,"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can dicern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added, 'So, if there where objects in this picture like airplanes... or Egyptian-style pyramids... you could see what they were!'" This quote proves that the best picture ever taken so far of the Face clearly shows that it is a natural thing. The natural landform could not be mistaken as anything else in the pictures we have.

It is clear that the Face is a natural landform because the picture in 1998 revealed it, NASA comfired it was a natural thing which caused them to not get extra funding, and the picture taken in 2001 is the clearest one we have and it is very obvious that it is a natural landform. These reason show how the Face is a natural landform and not an alien made thing.
