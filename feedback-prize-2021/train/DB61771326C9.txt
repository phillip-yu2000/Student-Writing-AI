Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that you are a little conflicted on the decision of banning cell phones from school, or not. I am writing to tell you my opinion on cell phones. Maybe it will help you make a decision, and also see the situation from my point of view.

I believe that cell phones should be aloud in school and for multiple reasons. One reason they should be aloud is because people need their cell phones. I am not talking about the fact that we must have our cell phones or we would 'die', but the fact that we need them for emergencies. If we didn't have our cell phones, how will we know if family emergencies occur. Or even if our parents are not home so we have to stay at another house. We may also need our phones for 911 emergencies, and even to call home to say that your going to be late. Our phone is our life line of sorts. We need them for way more reasons than texting, listening to music, or making 'petty little phone calls' as you say.

So in conclusion, I think that you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during their free time. As long as they have their phone turned off in class. It's giving them free rein, but with limits.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
