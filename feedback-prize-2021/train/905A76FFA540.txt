When driverless cars come up in convesation must people will be like "wow so cool", but most people do not know what they are talking about and they think they just want to look cool in front of people with their cool new gadgets. Driverless cars are easilly a good thing, but why? Most likely driverless cars are safer with more advanced technology than we have now and they also can prevent some pollution that the public transportation system gives off in the major cities. Most people think that driverless cars are dangerous or they think they are just some cool technology.

Driverless cars are a good thing to come, but not anytime soon. Driverless cars can prevent accidents from happening. Teenage drivers are the leading cause of accidents worldwide because they are knew to it or they are on their phone while they are driving. Just think if teenagers had a driverless car the accident rate would go way down and the teenagers that are so young would stop getting killed. Driverless cars are not just for teens, but for everyone think of the elderly, in some peoples opinions old people or senior citizens should not be able to drive. Driverless cars could help get elderly to their bingo games safe and on time. Paragraph nine states "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers." Now people know that teenagers are never going to listen and put their phones down because they think they are smarter than the last person who was texting and driving. It says that "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe."(9). Well one way they can do that is with driverless cars.

Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that driverless cars can replace public transportation such as taxis or busses. Major cities in the United States have the highest pollution globally and that is to blame the public transportation system along with many other things, but public transportation is one of the main factors. Sergey Brin envisions "a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."(1). We do not know if this will be happening some time in the near future or years down the road. Sergey claims that the driverless cars would "use half the fuel of todayÂ’s taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."(1). Well since we know that major cities usually have some sort of public transportation system now they are letting off huge amounts of pollution and using a lot of fuel each and every hour of the day. Something has to change Sergey Brin says he wants to cut the taxis and busses feul in half by using driverless vehicles instead. He states the vehicles would "offer far more flexibility than a bus."(1). We do not know what this statement means, but if it means that he can make driverless busses that recieve better fuel economy than a regular bus that is polluting the earth. That would be a really big improvement if he could accomplish that. Stopping global warmming should be a big topic of discussion and driverless cars could have a big impact on stopping global warmming.

Most people do not think about how the impact on society that driverless cars can bring to the table. People do not think about how the cars could potentially save teenagers lives or their family or anyone for that matter. Also, they do not think about the fact that driverless cars could replace the public transportation system and stop one of the main factors contributing to the pollution or global warmming. Some instances driverless cars could be a bad thing in our world and some people just want to look cool. Citizens have to look at it from a different prospective and imagine a safer and less polluted place. Driverless cars are the future and they are only going to raise more conflicts.
