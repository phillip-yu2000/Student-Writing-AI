I think students should be aloud to have phones during school because, maybe the student needs the phone to call there parents after school. also if your students shower trustworthiness by keeping there phone off in school can lead to other thing. Such as more freedom during school to do more things. Plus i think it would be pretty fresh to have your phones out during lunch because, it would keep you occupied and quite wile you wait for your lunch.

In addition most student would still bring there phones anyway. So would you rather have your students going behind your back and bringing there phones to school and text all threw school, or let them bring them to school and they only text during lunch. Furthermore this might build a better relationship with your student and your self.

In conclusion i think police 1 would end up being the better choice!
