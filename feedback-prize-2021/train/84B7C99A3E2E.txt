i dont think that having driverless cars would be a great idea. i think this because there could always be something that could go wrong if your going at high speeds such as if you were to hit a bump then the steering wheel would jemp in a certain direction which could cause for an accident. also if there was an accident resulting in injury or death who would be held accountable for that? the driver or the manufacturer of the "self driving car"? i feel like it would also be alot safer to be driving and ready and focused instead of having to pay attention to the road only a certain amount of time and directing your attention towards something else. i also feel as if it would be safer to have a driver in the car because what if you may see something that the car cant like something coming to the side of you and the car didnt react quick enough.
