There is a face on Mars, and us humans can not decide if it was made by aliens or if it was made naturaly. In the pictures my crew (NASA) and I took may look like it has changed over the years but it really has not changed at all. Our picture in 1976 has a lack of good quality. From that point forward our quality has got a lot more visible.

I believe the face on Mars is a natural landform, and also there are no aliens up on Mars to make this face.

The face on Mars is a natural landfrom because in paragraph seven in the article states, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all." That is saying no alien was up there to create the landform. If there was aliens up there NASA would have annouced it. We NASA have taken pictures of Mars and have not seen any aliens upon there.

Also stating in paragraph eleven "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" Saying that if there are aliens on Mars you would be able to see them on there, but you can not.

So, proven right there that there are not aliens on Mars plain and simple. This face is popular as it gets! Everyone needs to know it was not created by aliens because if it was we would already know by now in this point in time. That face on Mars is not made by aliens, it is made natural.

The face on Mars is made naturaly simple as that I can not get more simple than that.

I a NASA scientist believe that it was made naturaly no figure, no alien was up on Mars physically making faces on Mars. If we were to go up to Mars right now we would not see any alien. Anytime you hear "Aliens on Mars created the face of Mars" just know it is a myth. There is no aliens up on Mars, and there will never be aliens on Mars.
