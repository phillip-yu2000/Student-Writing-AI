Have you ever wanted to be a cowboy who crosses the sea? Now you can, if you join the seagoing cowboys program! I think you should join the program because you get to help nations recover their supplies and explore the world as you travel which I thought was really fun to do.

One reason I think you should be a seagoing cowboy is to help the nations by giving them more things they need such as food, animals, and more. I think helping the nations by doing this in the war will contribute to them so they could win if I give them the things they need to win the war.

Another reason I think people should join is to have fun. I say that because while you are at sea you could explore different places around the world. While being a seagoing cowboy, I visited places like Europe and China while i was working as a seagoing cowboy. I also went to Greece to see an Acropolis, and I even went to an excavated castle in Crete. When the animals are unloaded you could play many things such as Table-tennis, baseball, volleyball, and many more in the empty holds where the animals were.

In conclusion, i think people should join the seagoing cowboys program because you get to help the nations regain their supplies, and you get to have fun by exploring around the world. You should join because the seagoing cowboys program is fun and helpful to many people.
