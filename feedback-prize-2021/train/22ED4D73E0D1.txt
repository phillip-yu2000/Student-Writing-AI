We all need help from time to time, advice allows us to ask others when we have a problem.

See Each human being is different from one another. But we have different experiences and some have had have the same experience.

but you wont find out until you ask you have to ask for advice and you must hope you might find the answer from someone else. They also may know other people other who know the answer and they might help .

Another opinion may help you make your choice. You may have asked but you have conflicting ideas on what you want to do. As you might have found multiple answers but you dont know what to choose you must go which is most correct. Do a Google search talk to your family but is comes the choice YOU MUST MAKE. Its on you to make the correct choice advice is made up of opinions other people give you its your job to listen to them or not.

You may be confused , scared ,negligent on the choices see advice helps you. Others help you by trying to give you there opinions about the subject at hand. See at times and you need help lets say you were hungry and you where at a gas station. And there was some nice crispy bag of chips waiting there and you where alone. Nobody to ask should i take this bag of chips next thing you know your banned for life. Because you stole a bag of chips.

In conclusion i will sum up all my points but before i do that thank you for reading my essay! Well as you see advice helps us because we ask other people who had something like the problem youve faced. And are asking about as you ask they might understand and give the answer you were looking for.

Another opinion may sway your choice onto which answer you want you also may not know what to do this may be completely new to you. And it might be confusing thats why you can speak to talk onto ask other people.
