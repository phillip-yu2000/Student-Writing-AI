Driverless cars should not even be advertised in car stores because they sound dangerous. People may think driverless cars sound cool in all, but in reality; what if someone's driverless crashes? Then that person would not think their driverlesss car is so cool then.

Driverless cars are just like other cars around the world except that driverless cars do not have drivers inside them. Driverless cars also have sensors like regular cars as stated in paragraph 5 so that is nothing new to anybody or anything. Driverless cars look basically like regular ordinary car which makes not very interesting to people who are looking to buy them.

Driverless cars are also very dangerous and can cause serious problems to humans on this earth. As stated in paragraph 8, The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge, Driverless cars can cause so much trouble in people's lves. They can also cause confusion when it comes to having an accident with another driver because as stateed in paragraph 9, "Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?" If someone gets into a car accident; they will not even know who's fault it would if somebody got severely injured because the driver would have no control at all over the vehicle so in my opinion driverless cars should not be advertised in car shops.

In conclusion, whether that driverless cars are dangerous or that they can cause problems; they should not be sold to anybody because they would be nothing but trouble and pain.
