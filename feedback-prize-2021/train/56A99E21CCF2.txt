Should driverless cars be made? No beacuse a driverless car cant do everything a person in the car can do. Yea driverless cars can drive themselfs but then the human in the car has to take over because the driverless car cant go around everything. Such as a road blocks. It can give directions to get around them but cant do it by themselfs.

A driverless car can do great things but whats going to happen when the car cant do things its suppost to do. What I mean is what if the car is on the highway and it sarts to malfunction and it starts doing thing on the road that can get you hurt of killed. What if you dont want to drive anymore and the driverless car doesnt want to drive itself.

Now this car can be incredible or it can be a mistake. When your on the road and the driverless car is driving itself and all of a sudden boom. The car crashes into another car who would that be on or who would have to pay? You or the compony you bought the car from. See the car you bought crashed by itself because you are letting the driverless car drive itself. Now you have to pay the person that the driverless car hit because you didnt have the wheel to prevent the crash from happening.

See these cars can be good for you or bad for you to get. These cars can do good thing or thing that will make you have to pay someone almost over $1000 because you were not driving to prevent the crash from happening. This is why we shouldnt have driverless car that drive themselfs, anything can happen with driverless car driving around.
