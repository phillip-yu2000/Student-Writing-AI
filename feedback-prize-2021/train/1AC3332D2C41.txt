I am against the driverless cars . These cars require you to put all your trust into this machinery, to be able to trust in them to get you there safe and back safely. What happens if the car breaks down? or the system crashes? I could be seriously injured in this accident. This states that there will be a computer system that will run this car . But what if this computer system gets hacked and you can easily reprogram it to go to a different areas which could lead to kidnappings. Or just have a bunch of crashes occur all around the world . Sure there are sensors to help with the saftey. but there isn't a 100% assurance on the capibility on hacking into the system. I believe that if you are too lazy to drive somewhere then you shouldn't be driving. Do not put someone elses life in danger due to the lack of effort to drive. There are many ways to get around without having to drive yourself. These are some examples; Carpooling , Uber drivers, Taxi , Bus services, or if possible walk or ride a bike. By doing this you are causing less pollution and you can save money by walking or riding a bike.

Keep in mind that everyone has somewhere to be take your time and be mindful of the people arond you. You have to pay attention, there is this saying, "You have to drive for yourself AND others". Safety is key.
