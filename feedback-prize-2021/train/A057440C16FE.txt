Put this in perspective: a technology that could depict human emotion. Luckily, Dr. Huang of the University of Illinois has created this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, which enables computers to identify human emotions. He used this new technology to depict the emotions of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The uses of this technology are endless, but one specific use could be in the classroom.

The use of this technology in the classroom has potential to be very valuable. For instance, if a teacer is teaching and a student is confused or bored, there is a way to teach that specific student in another way that may benefit him or her. Depicting these emotions would be done by way of computer. There would be a classroom computer and when it picked up confusion or boredom, it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The technology benefits the teacher and the students.

One special use of this technology is how it can modify the lessons being taught by teachers. People are all different and learn in a variety of ways. Some people are visual learners and some people can learn just by listening. The technology can use the different models of teaching to benefit each student.

Because of Dr. Huang, the Facial Action Coding System could be used in places all over the world but in particular, the classroom. His technology can change the way of teaching and create more opportuinities for students to learn. Also, the modifications of teaching students can be done to fit each student and how they learn. Students and teachers will have access to a whole new environment for learning that will benefit their education. This technology will be able to depict students' emotions of confusion and boredom, change the way of teaching, and create lasting impacts on the education of students.
