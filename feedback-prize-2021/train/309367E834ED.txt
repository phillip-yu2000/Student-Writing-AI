Dear Principal,

I know you are deciding on whether to make community service a requirement.

I would like to suggest some ideas that can make this decision easier for you.

Personally, I think it is great that some people like helping others, but some just don't have the time. For example, a lot of minors do sports and other activities that take up a lot of their time to do anything else.

During the week they have practice and on the weekends they have meets or games.

The rest of the time in the week not spend playing sports or doing activities is spend doing homework, or resting up for what the next day will bring.

If some kids want to do community service they can, but i don't think that you should make it a requirement.

I do gymnastics so I have practice everyday and on the weekends I have meets; the leftover time in the week i use to do homework or hang out with friends.

I wouldn't want to spend my precious homework time to do community service.

A lot of my friends also do soccer and volleyball, and the same as me, they have practice everyday, as well as games on the weekends.

The only time we all have to do homework is after practice and on the weekends after our games.

The community service time would take up my time to be an A student.

As we all know, education is very important.

Plus, we are doing community service by getting an education because, if we do well in school, then we can have good grades and get into a really good college.

After that we can go onto getting good jobs and making our world a better place.

I hope you take my thoughts into consideration that some of us just don't have as much time as other people in the school.

I hope you understand my argument and agree with where I am coming from.

From, Your Student
