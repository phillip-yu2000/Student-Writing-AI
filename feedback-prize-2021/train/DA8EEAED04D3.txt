The Face

Some people don't believe the Face on Mars is a natural landform. They believe that aliens created it. Some people also believe that it was not actually found on earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, has compared it to natural landforms on earth. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original photos taken by the Viking. It took a while, but Jim was able to prove it.

Jim Garvin says, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." That is a natural landform found on earth. He also says, "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" He says this because some people believe that it was not found on Mars.

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original Viking pictures. The passage states, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." It was then official that the Face was not created by aliens, it is a natural landform.

Garvin has proven that the Face is a natural landform found on Mars. He gave examples of what natural landforms it could look like on earth. Viking 1 captured amazing photos of the Face. Michael was able to snap a better picture than the Viking photos. People still do not believe that it is a natural landform, but Jim has proven it.
