I am for the technology to read students' emotions. This technology would help people. But after you find their mood then you should talk to them about it and ask them if they want to talk about. Most people that anger or sad they do not want to talk about, or people don't ask how your day is going. So this technology would help some kids that need help and i think i would make schools safe too.

It says' in the article that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This would also help kids that are struggling in class and could get them more help. This would let the teacher know who needs help and who does not need the help. I think people would have better grades because the teacher would know to help, or they would feel better after talking about what is wrong. This technology could change everthing in schools.

This is why i think this technology should be a thing because it would schools and even works. This would make it better in the world to make people happy. I think people would talk about what is wrong if you ask them because you want the students mad or upset inn class. They would not learn as much becasue they would be thinking about what is wrong. This technology should be a thing.
