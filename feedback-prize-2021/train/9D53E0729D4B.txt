Dear Principal ,

I believe that Policy 1 is a good idea. I think policy 1 is a good idea because if there is ever a situation were a student has to call some one for help and have no one around them that can help they need to be in contact with some one that can help them or either get them help. Sometime teachers do let students have a few minutes off in class and decide to let the children use electronics, so it would be nice for the students to have that choice and not be scared to get caught. I also think that students should be able to bring phones to school so they can call their parents if they need to be picked up from school because the buses are canceled due to the snow storm and cant get home. In my opinion, there are many reasonable reasons why students should be aloud to bring their cell phones to school.
