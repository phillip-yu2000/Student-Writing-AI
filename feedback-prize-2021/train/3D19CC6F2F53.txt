my point of lukes avendture

I am here to talk about why we should agree that being a seagoing cowboy is a really good idea so hang on tight and just listen, hope u enjoy .

Some good reasons to be a seagoing cowgirl/boy is you get to help animals while your traveling over sea. Also its a good experience and you might want to learn about the ocean, thats a good reason to be a seagoing cow girl or boy and you might want to try it out .There might be some big waves but your with animals traveling and helping out thtas important to do .Its also a beautiful ,wonwerful,aventure to explore .

I support Luke becuase he says thats its an one one life oppertunity. It was he got to travel over seas to Europe ,he went pass Greece . He also traveled over the Pacific Ocean twice,and the Artic Ocean 16 times .Its a good aventure and you should try it one day .

So he got to do alot of things that were totally awsome! I want to know do you think you should try it one day yes or no ? And please right about why you whould and who inspired you ?
