The author supports this idea fairly well, giving an extreme amount of interest into the topic. He too is like any other human, curiosity driving him. Paragraph 8 states, "Striving to meet the chcallenege presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.", this being explained that human curiosity does drive people to do things. The mind is a very confusing thing for humans, that we still to this day doesn't understand. They have thought of many solutions for getting on the surface to mars, whether it being vehicles flying 30+ miles above the surface to have a glance of what they're dealing with, or using certain materials to make a machine last longer on the surface to get the data they need. We can't stay there permenently to obtain data, but we can stay there for a slight bit, as Paragraph 5 says, "Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape", and as Paragraph 7 states, "For example. some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions...". Though our human race hasn't even dented the knowledge of the world, our technology is advancing whether it's taking 20 years or 20 days. Soon enough, we could support civilization on Venus.
