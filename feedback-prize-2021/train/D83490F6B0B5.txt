Almost every student falls ill at least one time in a school year. Many people still attend school despite their sickness just because they are frightened they will fall behind in their classes. They are not only hurting themselves but also the people around them; this is because if they come to school sick they are risking the chance that other people will get infected as well. If schools allow students to attend classes online they are offering them a way for to access the work done in class without the risk of falling behind or infecting other people with their illness.

If schools offer online classes, then students will be able to get help whenever they need it. Students have limited resources when it comes to help outside of class. Students only have one free block in their schedule, so if the teacher is busy during that time period they have no other way to get help from them. By offering classes online students can access help whenever they need it.

Classroom settings are often quite hectic, if schools offer online classes then students can focus better in a more peaceful environment. Classrooms are filled with thirty students or more students, and all it takes is one person to get off topic and the whole class will lose focus. Often times you will have friends in the same classes with you. Thus, it's very easy to lose focus and start talking to them instead. If you allow students the opportunity to take lessons at home or at a less distracted location, then they are going to learn better.

Schools should offer online classes to students because it makes learning easier for them. Schools need to have a place where students can take classes outside of school. Students benefit from attending classes at home because it allows students who couldn't normally attend class to not fall behind, it gives them have access to the information they are learning in class if they need extra help, and they can learn better in places with little distractions.
