Raither than using technology to guess on students emotions I feel that teachers should ask and be there for a student. Looking at a peace of art work and seeing that a child is unhappy is easy to spot. Teachers have a hard time conecting with their studens because they dont know how to comunacate with them. How can we say that this Technology will do a better job then the teachers that we have now.

Technology on the other hand is only guessing on if a student is upset or angry or even happy. Although the technology could see if a child is board or confused. That is a huge pluss espesly if that means the lession can be changes to make the children understand what they are learing. Every student learns a diffrent way. Not everyone will understand at the same pase or be able to comunacate that they are strugling to understand something.

By using this technology learning can be a hole new and exciting thing for a lot of students. If this technology works then a lot of stand off students can be more intuned on lessons they need to understand and know.
