Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of keeping the electoral college election. This method has worked well for us so far, and there would be no point in changing it now.

the electoral college is fair. A presidential candidates must have trans-regional appeal to be elected."No region (South, Northeast,ect.)has enough electorial votes to elect a president."(Richard A. Posner) If a presidential candidate with only regional appeal was elected, he would unlikely be successful president. The people would feel like their votes didn't count, like they didnt have a voice in this nation anymore. Would our nation fall apart?

With electorial college we aviod the situation in which no candidate receives a majority of votes(run-off election). Run-off elections is reduced by the electorial college. There is no pressure in our nation for a run-off election. The electorial college invariably produces a clear winner, so that there is no confusion.

Our founding fathers saw the future. they knew that this process, of electing a president, would carry are nation through the decades. It is in my best interest that we keep the electorial college.

sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
