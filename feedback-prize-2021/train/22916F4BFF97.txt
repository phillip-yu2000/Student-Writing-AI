New software has been devloped that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. According to some new computer software that can reconize emotions. The children said (hold up! Can we accually "calculate" emotions like math homework. the evidence is that there is a computer that make's a 3d model of your face. In the artical it says that the computer can even show mixed emotions. The computer could even store's simaliar ThIng inside of someone.(indroducion ) . It will be great for a teacher to use because you will be able to see the he or she is confused of if they are bored and etc. They made that because thier is alot of that have thing wrong with them the just dont like expressing thier feelings. But to wrap it all up animate faces are more expressive. the cumputer is cool the way it can scan peoples mood. Another cool feature about that I personaly like is that how it could the you what bones and how many bone are inside of your body. And it's cool because most people do not like to communicate so the compture tells you what are they thinking and also how are they feeling.
