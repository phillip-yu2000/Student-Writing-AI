Driverless cars are the future of technology.

I am for the development of driverless cars. I feel that it would make life easy and more simple for people. The combination of todays technology in cars already consists of video cameras, sensors, GPS recievers, bluetooth audio, and more. All of which were made to make driving fun and different each time you would want to go somewhere. I feel that sensors will eventually be the brain of all technology. The article states that the information from sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far more better response and control than a human driver could manage alone.

In my opinion, driverless cars would be safer because it wouldn't be the cause of any accidents or harm to pedestrians. GM has already developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, other options under considersation are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. I also think that driverless cars would interpret driving in such a new way that it would make it both, fun and safe. Automakers have already started on making driverless models; Telsa has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz,Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive by themselves by 2020. The advancement on autonomous cars are already in the works, maybe we'll all own one sooner than we think.
