You are in a relationship with a boy named Generic_Name and everything is going well. You are also best friends with a girl named Generic_Name, who starts to become jelous becuase of how much time you are spending with Generic_Name, so she tells you to make choice him or me. now you have two choices to make eithier to stay with Generic_Name or go with Generic_Name you do not know what to do so you ask for advice from friends, family and neighbors and they tell you something diffrent but you are happy because now you have diffrent opptions to choose from than the ones you had in mind.

When people need advice they should talk to more than one person because they might get a better alterniative choice than what they had before, or they could see what their neighbors,friends and family would do in your situation, or they might give you great tips that you could you in the future.

The first reason people should get advice from more than one person is because you might get a better option than what they had mind, like for instance lets go back to the story ,and lets say the child was gonna tell her friend off by telling her that she was a loser and that she never liked her anyways or that she should cry herself a river and build herself a bridge and get over the fact that she spending most of her time with Generic_Name. But instead you sat her friend down and tell her that she did not mean to spend all her time with Generic_Name or you might even go out to lunch togather and talk about whatever was bothering you. Which would be a way better outcome than the first exsample.

The second reason people should get advice from more than one person is because it is better to hear what your neighbors, friends, and family would do in your situation because you might not agree with the first advice you get. For exsample lets say the child in the story asks her neighbor what she should do and they tell her to punch the girl now you may or may not agree with that but you always have your friends and family but maybe your friends tell you to leave Generic_Name your other friend and stay with Generic_Name but you do not like that choice either, so you go to your family and they tell you to do what you think is right so you think about it and you sit your friend down to talk.

the third and last reason you should get advice from more than one person is because someone might give you tips that you could use in the future. Like maybe your aunt has been through what you are going through and wants to give incouraging words like let your heart deside not your friends or you will know who is best for you. Or maybe your grandma tells you that if your friend can't be happy for you then she is not a good friend which you could use when you are older like if someone cant love you then they are not the one for you and that you will find the right person oneday maybe not right now.

Inconclusion getting more than one persons advice is best because we do not know everything and depending on only one persons advice can be quite unsettling at times so leaning on other people opioions can help a lot now we might not like what one person says but thats why we always have other peoples advice to usecso we should use all the advice that comes our way.
