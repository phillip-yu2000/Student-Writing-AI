Help wanted!

The Seagoing Cowboys program is in need of help from other herders.

Why would anyone want to do this? With the program, you are able to help out other people, do things you typically would not do, and have fun.

I think it is beneficial to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you are able to help out people.

It is important to help people because not only does it benefit them, it benefits you as well by bringing joy in to your life.

In the text it states that in 1945,

World War 2 was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

This is just one reason why this program is beneficial.

Another reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is becuase you get to do different things in your free time that you would not normally get to do.

In the text it says that they got to tour many places.

My final reason why I think that joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial is because you get to have fun.

In the text, it says that while they were unloading the animals, they played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading and even whittling.

These are just a few reasons why I think that people who join the program will have lots of fun.

In conclusion to all of this, I think the Seagoing Cowboys program is beneficial to all.
