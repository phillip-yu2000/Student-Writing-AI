I think that driverless cars shouldn't be made. I say this because of all the problems i could see happening with these driverless cars that could lead to a loss of life. Although it does state in the writing that all the cars are not really driverless and still require human interaction, but i could still see something going wrong and someone getting injured or even killed. I also think that most humans drive well anyway even though there are a few crazy people out there doesnt mean that no one can drive, especially the people that have been driving for like 30 years.

My first reason I think driverless cars shouldn't be made is because who would want a driverless car that still requires a driver. For example "The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge. Admits Dr Werner Huber." I dont see any reason to want to halfway drive a car.

Secondly im sure the car would have problems and end up making the driver really angry. Then just think abut if the car messed up and got into an accident, who would be at fault the person or the manufacturer?.

Lastly i just think its not a good idea. I can see lots of things going wrong with this and i think people regulary driving is just fine. Now that i think about it i wouldn't feel safe in one of them. Overall i just feel it would be a bad idea and bad things will happen.

In conculsion I am against driverless cars being made. I chose to be against it becasue who would really want a driverless car even though it needs human assistance. Another reason is because i could see the cars having problems and end possibly getting someone killing in an accident. My final reason is because i jsut really dont think its a good idea in general.
