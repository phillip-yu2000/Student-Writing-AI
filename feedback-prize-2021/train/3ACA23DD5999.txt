The development of driverless cars should be stopped immediately. I do not see the point in them, considering a person would just be bored sitting in the car with nothing to do. Many people enjoy driving and being in control, and driverless cars would take this feeling away from them. Additionally, I would not feel as safe in a world with driverless cars. Especially when they are first available, driverless cars would only endanger everyone around them. Their mechanics or sensors could suddenly fail at any time. Also, it will take a while for the manufacturers to perfect the cars, so therefore these cars will be even more hazardous at first. In addition, I am positive the computer geniuses out there would surely find a way to hack and take control of the cars somehow and commit murders. Detectives may not be able to find out who is committing such awful crimes, considering it could be anyone, and it would not take much effort. Furthermore, driverless cars will be completely pointless; the driver will always have to keep a close eye on what the car is doing and make sure it does not do anything wrong. What is the point of driverless cars if they are not actually driverless? I understand numerous car wrecks are happening currently because some people just do not pay attention, and everyone wants the number of wrecks reduced, but driverless cars will not help whatsoever. People will continue to be distracted by their phones and other electronics and think that since they are not controlling the car, they do not have to watch the road. This is a mistake. If people stop watching the road altogether, more wrecks will occur. Mistakes will always be made. The number of crashes may go down slightly, but the feeling of unsafeness will only increase for the people inside the car. I do not agree with the idea of driverless cars and the production should be stopped immediately.
