Having online classes could be so much helpful and easier for those kids who doesn't leave near the school, or doesn't own car, it could be helpful because student wouldn't had to wait outside for a bus to pick them up, or for someone to take them to school, it could be easier because they could finish their classes from their house they would just need any electronic device and a connection to WIFI.

By having online classes I think it could make students life much easier, because if they get sick they can still take their classes and they wouldn't have to worry about making other students sick and there would be less chances of getting sick by other student, student would not have any excuse for not taking their classes, taking online classes could also help those student who are always late to school because they would take their class from their house so any bad weather could not be an obstacle.

There are many good thing about taking classes online but there always somethings students would need to give in order to have this benefits and that thing is social life, many students would never see their friends again because everyone has a different mind no everybody has the same goals and not everyone likes the same stuff so in my opinion thats one negative thing of online classes, but there are alwaysÂ a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups and I think online classes could change students life.
