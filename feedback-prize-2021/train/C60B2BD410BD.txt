The article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D'Alto presents an idea that a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can recognize human emotion. The article mentions that It can determine your emotion even if you seem like your not trying to express a specific emotion. This would be extremely helpful in classrooms so that students can have a better learning experience.

In the classroom, students tend to let their minds to drift off and sometimes they get confused but they're to shy to say anything. With having this new Facial Action Coding System, the system could modify the lesson plan based on how the students feel about it. For example, Dr. Huang from the article says that, "This classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This technology would also help the teacher learn more about their students so that they can help them when needed. This technology would play a big role in the future of schooling.

The Facial Action Coding System, is a different kind of computer. It determines your emotion which makes it different from the rest. This techonolgy plays a benefical addition to the classroom. If we incooperated them in the class, students would have a better learning experience and it would help the teachers learn more about their students!
