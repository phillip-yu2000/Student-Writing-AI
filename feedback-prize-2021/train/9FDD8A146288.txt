i think it not good for students because it didn't help students learn and you have to do the work by self . I think that school is better because it teach you how to do the work and the teacher helps you on the work. online school is not good is because it didn't teach you and you might not know how to do the work for the class for online. you might ask people for help when you don't know how to do the work when your at school the teacher teach you how to do the work and gets you all the help you in class and and afer school too so you can get more help on the work and the missing work and wok and if you don't understand the lesson. you could ask your teacher for help and be ready for test and the sol. You will learn better in school then online school. School is better learn because the teacher are there for you if you need to talk to them or to get help in the work or to get more lesson and they give you a lot of time on work and give you time on the test and gets you ready for the sol. one examples that you get better learning in school and the teacher help you understand the work. second online school is tell you how to do the work and you have to find it out for yourself.Â
