Dear Principal,

I strongly disagree with your idea on changing the grade average from a C average to a B average. The students who participate in sports have to work twice as hard as any other student who doesn't participate in sport activities, because they have homework, practice and games. The games take up at least two hours and if they don't finish their homework after school before the game they have to finish it after their game which could go from six o clock to eight. They also have to be there an hour early. When they get home it's late and they just want to relax because they have worked hard that day. But they have to finish their homework and if they have a project they have to work on that to. It's harder for them even more when they have a test they next day and they have a sports event the night they are going to study even more, so they have to stay up later then usual. Then they don't get a good night of sleep then they don't do good on the test because they are tired. Which means they cant participate in the sport they play because of that. I would know this because I participate in sport activities and I have to work very hard to get good grades I have to stay up late and sometimes I don't get good night rests. The next day I am really tired and I don't do as good in school as I should because of it.

It's a lot harder in school because of sports if you change the average then school will be even harder and if the athletes don't get a B average then all of there hard work in school would be for nothing. Then if the athletes got their grades up it would most likely go back down because they would be back in sports which would cause the whole process over again. They are working twice as hard and they have a C average but they would have to work even harder which would be very difficult for them.
