The author has sort of a dream of going to Venus. He claims that it is possible because they're both epual in size and similar in some areas.

Besides the point Venus can reach up to extreme levels of heat from how close it is to the sun and all the fumes or carbon dioxide. Speakin of carbon dioxide majority of Venus think atmosphere is almost 97percent carbon dioxide. Reaching over 800 degrees on average, and the atmaspheris pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on Earth, it can get pretty hot.

It makes since to try to go to Venus, because we want to know if there is anymore life out there besides Earth, it makes since, but Venus would almost be impossible for a while until we get more/better technology to travel to any other planets. We might try to go to other planets before that on because it would be impossibly to try to live or stay there. We are more likely to go to Mars before any other planet, because it is also similar to earth, but atleast it not super hot like either Venus, or Mercury.

We want to see if there are any other life out there so we want to try to go to other planets to try to see whatelse is out there, and as the author wants us to try to go to Venus, might not be possible for a while, but I think it will be possible soon.
