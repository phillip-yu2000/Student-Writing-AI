In my opinion I think getting advice from more than one person is good because... 1. You can get multiple answers and thoughts. When you think about all the answers you've got then you can come up with your own advice for yourself. Then when you have you advice you can make the best choice for you.

2. It's best to ask multiple people anyways because then you wouldn't get stuck with one answer that could possibly be the wrong advice for you.

Sometimes you could get the right answer from anyone, but you could find the right advice your looking for from someone that needed the same advice before also.

3. For example, when I use to play baseball, I could not hit the ball as far as my friends did. So I decided to ask them for some advice. Some of them would only say "Its just how I hit." or "It depends on how big you are." So I ended up asking my whole team in tillÂ I got something to actually help me with my hitting.

And now I know and you know that asking multiple people is not a good way, but the best way to get advice for yourself.
