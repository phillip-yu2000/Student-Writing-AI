Hey, most people ask for advise from others, do you?

Advise from others can be helpful because you can make your own opinion base off others. Dont have to do much research. Also it can be easier on your self. From that do you think advise from others is helpful.

Have you ever thought about how much easier it will be on your self getting advice from others is? You can easily just ask others instead of going with your own advise. Going with your own advise all the time is not gonna get you very far.

You could look it up and, thats a lot work. Well do you think thats easier.

I think making your own opinion base on others would help you majorly. Say your asking people how many times a week should you walk your dog. your gonna get a lot of different answers. then as you record your info you can make your own thing about that reason. Making your own opinion base in others would work you see.

Researching things maybe your go to am i right? Your probably like yeah i'm gonna go an look this up, but some things you can trust the internet. Also you need to be social in your life so go out there and ask questions. I dont think you should research but so people do . see all opinion mater. Do you like researching stuff?

When people ask for advise the will sometimes ask others. do you think you would ask or just research or no be a social butterfly. i think you should make your own opinions base off others. Also you can make its easier by asking others. Research wont be as easy as asking others. so do you think you will ask others next time?
