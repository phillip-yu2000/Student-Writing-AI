Some school may assign summer projects for students. Do you think the students or the teacher should make the project idea? Being a student the teacher should fulfill that job,and have topic ideas, examples, and be able to help a long the way. Although, kids want easy projects, teachers will have a better knowledge for what the students need to know, they will have a good list of interesting projects, also they will make it fun all together.

First off, teachers know what you will be learning in the next years course. With them knowing that they will be able to teach you in the summer without them even being there. With the project in the summer it will keep you active in school thinking about how you will want to be organized but also it will prepare you for this up coming course your taking next year.

Second of all, teachers get to know you over 30 some weeks of school. With that they know what your like. Teachers will have fun interesting projects for all the students. When coming to a science fair topic for me its difficult to think off what should i do or will that be allowed. Teachers will take care of all of that though you will have a list of 5 or so topics to choose from. The topics will be educational for your next years class.

Furthermore, you don't want some lazy boring project you want a project that you will become interested in and want to learn more about thats what these teachers will be doing. Some of the projects i have chosen have been the most boring projects i have ever done, the ones teachers have chosen are the far more interesting ones that i want to keep learning about plus the ones i try my hardest on.

In conclusion, kids want easy projects, teachers will have a better knowledge for what the students need to know, they will have a good list of interesting projects, also they will make it fun all together. Those reasons should boost students minds to want to have a fun interesting summer project.Â
