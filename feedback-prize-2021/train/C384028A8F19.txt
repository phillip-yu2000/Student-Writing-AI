I do not see a place for self-driving cars in our time, but may see a place for them in the future. Although there are many advantages to these Google self driving cars there are also some things that take away from it's self- driving feature. Google may have found a new mode of transportation, but for the here and now I believe taxi's are for here to stay.

If these are self driving cars why must the driver or rider still be fully aware of the surrounding objects and traffic? If they had to state this why should this be allowed on the streets at all. This is a great idea and it's claims of helping our enviroment by using half the fuel the taxi's use would be a huge technological impact on our entire species' carbon footprint on our planet. But also what Google should deam the most important features of this product is it's saftey to passengers and to the vehicles surrounding it.

Although I do agree with amny this is a great idea and could take over the taxi cab industry in total, I feel this may be for the years down the road. Google shoudl wait ten to fifteen years in order to perfect the tehnology in order to get this self driving car on the roads. But until then I feel it is still time for the classic yellow taxi's to continue being driven by a human behind the wheel in our cities.
