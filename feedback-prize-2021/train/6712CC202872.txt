The development of these cars is a good idea because the cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. Most of these cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but are also designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.

Google cofounder Sergey Brin stated in the first paragraph "The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis." This means this car would save lots and lots of fuels when it comes to spending money on fuel for this car. Who wouldn't like saving money on fuel, right?

Also, in paragraph 1 Sergey Brin stated "... and offer more flexibity than a bus." Buses now a days don't offer as much service as we need them too. Buses only stop on streets but we need them to stop by each block. This is why i believe the development of these cars is a good idea.

Most of these cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but all cars re-designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. For example on paragraph 2 it says "Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents." This means the google cars will still have to have human assistance when needed.
