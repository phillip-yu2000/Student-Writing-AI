Dear Principal,

My view on this rule is that you should allow students with a C average to participate in school activities because there are some people that are bad at school but good at sports. Some of the students that have a C average could be helpful in winning championships. There are some sport stars that are horrible at school but not on the field. We never know what we teenagers are going to end up as. Some of us could be really famous sport stars. If you would not let us play, then how would we find our real self.

For example, maybe some people from the Pittsburgh Steelers weren't good at school but they turned out very successful. It's not only about sports it could also be about band or art. Maybe students in art could become the next famous painter who painted a drawing that could become more famous then the Mona Lisa. Students in band could become very successful in the music business. You should give us opportunities to become who we really want to become.

In this school there is a program called the Christian Club. Well maybe if you don't let these students participate then they aren't going to be interested in their religion. These students need to have the confidence that there are other students in the same religion that are willing to learn more about their religion. Many of our students here are Christian while many others are Catholic or another religion. Some religions believe different things and so the kids need to know how to follow their religion.

So, according to me you should let us participate in any activity that we are interested in. I'm really interested in soccer and I would be really upset if they told me I couldn't play because of my bad grades. These school activities are basically our future.
