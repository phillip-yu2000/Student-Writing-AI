The driverless cars aren't so driverless. The driverless car is suppose to allow you to not have to worry about driving but you must stay alert. Youre not just going to want to just sit there akwardly and do nothing while your car does all the work. Many people are going to think that this is a great idea till they start to understand the actually danger it puts you in. Driveless cars need to be put to a stop before many people become injured.

This is a horrible idea. Why would someone start to put many lives in danger? All they are doing is basically saying you just have to sit there and let the car do the work. What happens to the people if they accidently fall asleep because they're not doing anything? They're going to die or get seriously hurt. Then the company is the people who are going to end up in a bunch of trouble because they are leading people to these when they're just hurting them. The driveless cars aren't so driveless. You have to be alert at all times because the car cant make it through a traffic jam or any other roadblocks.

in conclusion, the driveless care wouldnt be a smart idea. It could end badly for both the person who buys it and the company who sold it. The driveless car seems to have more harm than good when you could easily just drive the car yourself. Driving the car yourself would lead to making this easiser onyourself. You dont have to worry about falling asleep by just sitting there. Driveless cars aren't so driveless!
