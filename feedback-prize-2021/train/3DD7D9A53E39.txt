Dear, state senator

The Electoral Collage was established by the very people who rote the Declaration Of Independince, some of our gratest invintors, and presidents the founding fathers. The Elcectoral Collage consits of

538

electors and only about

270

electoral votes are required to elect a president. I am in favor of keeping the Elcetoral Collage because the population is biased,and the population isnt always as smart as the people of the Electoral Collage and might not look at their criteria and stats and what quality's they have that make them a good presedent.

The Elcectoral Collage is made up of 538 elecrtorsthat are suposed to be non biased unlike the public who are very biased in ways that come down to voting for a president because of his skin color. If all of our presedints were voted in because of the race or religion we would wouldknow longer have a country, we would live in segrigation and poverty and would hve 99 cent stores.

Making a desion is some times very easie and some times very hard and most dissions are thought hard. While making a dessision on who to vote for afuture predident should take time but thats not always what happens. The public might not always take their time and look ovwr the facts and statistics on the future president and if we dint have the electoral collage we would have terrible presidents most of the time.

Inconclusion the Elcetoral collage is verry important, and we need it because the public isnt always wright even they think they are and it could have possibly saved our countries if the non elected runners for presedint would have bean president and it it possibly could have enden sufering and bad thing in out county but the Electoral Collage isnt always a good thing but its deeply needed
