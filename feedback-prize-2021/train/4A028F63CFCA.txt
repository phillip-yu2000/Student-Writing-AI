The human body is a complex network of muscles, bones, and organs to create one functioning person. These muscles, bones, and organs create diverse emotion whether it is through the face or through the body. The emotions help express themselves to others in order to relay their feelings to events or surroundings. A technology able to read a vast amount of emotions and help indicate their feelings would be incredibly beneficial to society as it would make understanding each other easier. This could help students in the long run by helping the school or instructor understand what interests them and what disinterests them by knowing their feelings to the emotions they convey.

The problem in schools around the country is the struggle to encapsulate a student's interest and maintaining it for numerous years. A technology that can help lead students in the correct direction, from the first day they step into a school, can lead to a more productive society. As Dr. Huang puts it, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too." (D'Alto.) If we can use this technology, we will be able to put the expressions and emotions into words and percentages. This removes the barrier of people struggling to understand each other. This technology will pave the way to a brighter and more efficient world by making people interested and happy to do what they do from the first day.

Technology is the way of tomorrow and will help create a better world. A technology that helps understand human emotion consistently will be the next big advancement for communication and language. A student needs to be understood in order for he or she to understand. A program that can easily make that happen in a few seconds as opposed to several years can help everyone enjoy what they do a little more.
