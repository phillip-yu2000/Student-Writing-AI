Have you ever thought about owning a vehicle that drives itself? Well, if you answered yes, this new invention would be great for you. This new invention is driverless cars.

As we all know many wrecks happen every single day. With driverless cars being out there I think the number of wrecks that happen would increase. Think about it. If one little thing on that car malfunctioned, you could get seriously hurt. Even though this might sound like a good idea, I think it's very dangerous. Who would want to own a driverless car that still needs a driver anyway? If the driver still needs to be alert of what's going on, I think driverless cars still need a lot of work to be done on them.

A solution to driverless cars is to make sure that the car can do everything on it's own and not need a humans help. If you're going to make a car that can drive itself, you better make sure it doesn't need our help. There's no point in making driverless cars if we still have to do part of the work.
