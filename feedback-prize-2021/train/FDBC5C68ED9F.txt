To the principal:

I think you actually should require all students to perform community service. Helping the community is very important, but it does indeed take up our time. What we should do as a school body is to be required to do 3 hours of community service. By doing so, we will reassure our fellow citizens that they do have help even if help is or is not needed. This will not only make us, as a school, learn leadership, but it will also help us to learn companionship.

This is the perfect opportunity to actually show people how we care for our community as a whole, and not just about ourself. You need to let us prove how we can not only be active in school, but also be active out of school. The student body should be required to do 3 hours of community service. We will do so in our free time. We should not be required to perform on a specific date, but on the date we choose. We could do it on the weekends or in our own free time. After doing the job, we get the sponsor to sign the sheet saying what we did, how long we did it, & any additional comments. The forms should be due at the end of the year.

As a whole, we should pick up trash on the streets for an hour. So that way, everyone can get credit of 1 hour, without having to worry about not having any done at all near the due date. As an individual, we should be able to choose what other things we could be volunteering for. We should play with disabled kids, work with the elderly, pick up trash anywhere, recycle, etc. Not only would some of us be happy to help, we would actually enjoy doing what we choose. All of us would choose something we are interested in. Which is why you choose 1 hour & we choose the remaining.
