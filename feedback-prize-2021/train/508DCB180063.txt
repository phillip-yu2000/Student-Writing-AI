Technology to read the emotional expressions of students shouldn't be used because someones facial expressions of students in a classroom well be like there mad but they won't be mad . Sometimes facial expressions are not always right , they can look upset and not be upset at all . Sometimes people just don't wanna smile or show any emotion . Sometimes the "Facial Action Coding System" might work but sometimes it might not . Not everyone face say how they really feel . Can't no computer tell you how you feel because a computer is not you and is not in your head . Can't nobody say how the Vinci was feeling at the time of him painting Mona Lisa . A computer is used to look up things , found out information , video chat , email , do homework on but having a computer read the emotinal expressions on a teenagers face is going have the system broke nobody know's how a teenager feels at that time not even the teenager . Teenagers have so many emotions in one second so how can a computer read a students facial expressions .
