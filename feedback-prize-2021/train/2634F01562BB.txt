Dear Principal,

I believe that policy 1 is better than policy 2 because the students might need to call their mom or dad to tell them if they feel sick or if they need to come home. You may think that cell phones should not be aloud at school but there are some reasons that students might need a cell phone at school. A cell phone is good to have just in case some thing happens to the child or the parents. With out cell phones parents would not be able to know were their children are or if they are safe. With out cell phones the students can not call their mom or dad to see who is going to pick them up or if they are going to walk home. So you really should think about all the students safety . you would want you kids to be safe too. So think about the other kids at your school don't you want them to be safe too.

So i think you should pick policy 1. I think it would be the right chose.
