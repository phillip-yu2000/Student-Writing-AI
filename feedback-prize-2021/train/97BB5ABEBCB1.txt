Dear ,TEACHER_NAME

The idea of making kids do community service should have opinions of other people the parents, and the kids and the school staff not just yours.

Some parents have to pick up there kids and other family traditions and or family mater .

Alot of kids do sports and threes a lot of coaches. To taking them out of there sports would not only be unfair but the coaches would not get paid .

The school staff have a life to so having to take care of kids and teenagers after hours would interrupt there personal time or time off of school .

Kids don't like come to school now what makes you think they will want to stay longer after sports or even before sports .

What I am saying is not only do kids already have the right to volunteer and help but its should be there right to choose if they want to or not. Start a club instead of making the whole school do it and garente that the club will get out of school to go clean up the state, county witch ever

I garente you they will stay to get out of class u will have a lot and they will get pride out of doing it !

Now do u see my point???

I think kids should have the right to choose if they do community service or not i' m not against you on the idea but i think that a club will be way better than the whole school having to do it.

Yours truly ,
