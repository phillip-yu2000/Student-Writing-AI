Dear principal,

I think that students should get at least a grade be average to participate in school activities.

Since student should play sports to get more athletic, but should also learn to keep their grades good. Sometimes you get good at sports, but your grades can be slipping away, so I think you should let students participate in sport but schools first. This is how you should let students participate in sports or other activities, so school first, activities like sports second. Also having fun activities including sports or other games can wait, work on finishing school work or homework before activities. For students, they have to know how school is very important and can affect their future if they don't take it seriously.

activities like sports including football, baseball, basketball, or soccer are very athletic an fun activities to do, you need to earn good grades before doing any other activities. I know how many people like to enjoy a lot of outdoor activities that can is very important to maintain your health, but you should make sure the students are doing well in school before letting them play any sports. You can still let them play some after school activities that involve sports or in the class physical education that tries to get you to be more athletic. So support your idea of get a good grade before playing sports or other activities.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
