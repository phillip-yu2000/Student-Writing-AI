The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The meaning of Electoral College is stated in Source 1: What is Electoral College and in paragraph 2.  The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the countiing of the electoral votes by congress. It consist of 538 electors. a majority of 270 eletoral votes is required to elect the president. The electoral College is very important because it helps us decide who the new president of the United States is going to be, but alot of people thimk that it is unfair and should be abolished.

To begin with, Electoral College is unfair because voters do not vote for the president they vote for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. The elector are picked by the state. Sometimes the voters cannot pick who the electors vote for.  "The electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational." It is hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College.

But, in defense of the Electoral College, there are a few reasons to keep our disliked method of choosing the president. One reasons is the Elecotoral College requires a prestidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. Also to avoid the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the vote cast. Lastly the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states.

Inconclusion, the Electoral College can be a good way to vote, but also it can be a bad way to vote.
