Should the principal force students to participate in one or more extracurricular activities?

Some students may have other activities to do after-school, and cannot find time for other activities.

Other students may think it is a great idea and have an astronomically amount of extra time to do extra-school activities.

There is no compensation for that because every student must participate in something, so for that reason, students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity, and there are several other reasons why.

Students have many other hobbies and don't have time to go to any of the extracurricular activities.

Other students have work, and cannot get time off, before or after school for the activities, which puts them at a huge disadvantage.

Many teenagers have all around season sports outside of school which provides no stable insurance of time with other activities.

Students may feel forced and not want to partake in any of the activities.

Students may feel an unwanted attitude and feeling from some extracurricular groups.

Students may have a grim the teacher of council of the group, because he is not good enough, or does not have enough experience.

The teachers may be negligent and not notice that one particular student is treating kids with more authority while the others kids are being submissive because they are not competent in sports, politics, etc..

Not every single student has a liking or interest to any of the extracurricular activities, and could quite possibly be interested in other activities.

Students may feel obliged and wanting to participate in activities, but are not going to because his/her friends don't want to dont want to indulge in that specific activity.

That may possibly discourage some students and could result in no participation at all.

Also, the student's parents may not allow participation in some particular activities because there might be a risk of getting injured in some sports, or their past experience with doing an activity that could prohibit participation in that activity.

Students could be stressed out from taking very difficult classes, and might just want to rest after facing conundrum questions on a science lab report, or calculus questions.

In conclusion, I do not agree or sanction with the principal's idea of having student's participate in one or more extracurricular activities.

With students having to do other things outside of school, they cannot make room for another extracurricular activity.

Also, students may feel unwanted because of the lack of experience they might have from the activity that they're doing just to tag along with his/her friends.

Overall, the idea of forcing students into an activity that they might not want to do, is very bad and may force the students into a bad attitude or bad habit.

To just let students choose what they want to is the best for them, instead of making students do what they don't want to.
