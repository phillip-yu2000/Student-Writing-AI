Have you ever done a extracurricular activity like a sport, a club, or just a service? What if your school told you that you had to do one. What would you pick and would agree or disagree with them? I would agree because doing a extracurricular activity can have many benefits like, being fun, helping the community, and it can even be good for you.

The first reason I think everyone should do a extracurricular activity is because it is fun. Doing a activity that you are good can be a lot of fun, but you can also pick one you do not know and learn something new. You can do the same activities as your friends and spend time together and have a lot of fun.

One more reason you should do a extracurricular activity is that you can help the community while do your activity. There are many ways you can help the community like joining a clean up club, volunteering at the library, or just giving any type of service. It is a great way to give back to the community. It can also be very good for nature and the environment.

Lastly, doing a extracurricular activity can be good for you. It can help balance out school work and gives you something more fun to do. It can also be good in a physical way if you are playing a sport or something involving exercise. Overall it will make you energetic and a lot happier.

In conclusion I think everyone should be required to do a extracurricular activity because it has many benefits. Being fun, helping the community, and being good for you are only a few of them. There a many more benefits of doing extracurricular activities, and I think everyone should do them.
