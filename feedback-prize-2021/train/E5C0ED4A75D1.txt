I disagree because if someone has stuff they want todo that they want todo not what someone else wants them todo then let them do it becuase if someone has like stage fright and you make them do student council they will be so nervous and disrupt that they will just start to lose intrest in that extracurricular activity.

Then that student won't be able to focus on things outside of that because they are just going to dred going to that activity and not be able to work on their school work and if that student can't focus enough on their getting good grades so their grades might drop then their self asteim will drop etc etc.

Third that student might not even want to do any extracurricular activitys because what would be the point of that it will just make it harder for teachers because most of them run those extracurricular activitys and after school is when most teachers grade papers /test or quiz's get there room straightend up for the next day and to plan.

Fourth if a principle starts to make everyone take an extracurricular activity he would probaly do the activitys during or after school if it was durring the school day he would have to schange the schedeules then the school would have to use so much more resourses that some schools don't have as much so then there won't be anymore physical homework mainly the homework would be online instead of right infornt fo you.

Lastly the main reason i disagree is that there is no reason to make kids do an extracurricular activivty because somekids arent good in sports or talking infront of a mass amount of people.
