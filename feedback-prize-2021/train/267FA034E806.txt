The limiting of cars in the world and commuinities sounds terrible but in a way its not all that bad for one reason it helps reduce smog in the area, people get more physical activity by walking and by cleaning up the city new business will come to the twon/city you live in people drive there cars everywhere they go, to the store , the mall, out to eat even if its in walkinng distance people relay on there car to get them where they need to go and this is a big problum because its creating unheathy smog in the environment that people and animals live in and by relaying on cars to get them where they need to go the people are only making the situation even worse then its becoming. Smog is like a poison fog created by cars and things of that nature and is put into the atmosphere for people to breath into there lungs and is but into there body just beacuse they "need" to drive where they "have"to go in such a hurry.

when you remove cars for an extended period of time or just the day people are forced into physical activity to relay on when they have to go places like the store, the mall, out to eat ect. its good for people just to get out and exercise instead of someone saying im going to the drug store that is a 5 min walk down the road. now its alot more reasonable if the place your going in like 5 miles from where you live then yes drive but if is 5 min walk just walk its not going to kill you. even if its just biking up the road to get the mail it still beats driving for no reason on somthing you could walk/bike to get.

If you remove cars once a week, evan once a year you could clean up the town/city you live in to bring new business to the town you live in and new busnisses means new jobs so that an econome increases in the town because it been cleaned up and new busniess has be created in your town.

in these three paraghaphs ive given three great reasons why imiting cars is a great advantage and help the small towns to big cities around the world.
