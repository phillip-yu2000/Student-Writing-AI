dear :TEACHER_NAME

i think that students could take community service. its not a must do thing so if they want to they cant but if they don't feel like they want to they don't have to.

If the person feels like its taking away to much time for stuff that they want to do they don't have to. if others want to help they can tutor elementary kids or clean up the litter they can even create other ways them self. when i see people doing community service that want to do it makes me feel good but if i see kids that don't want to do community service them it makes me feel bad that their doing it.

student that feel like they have the time and that their in the right place can do what ever they feel like doing . do you ever think about how the kids feel about homework or community service. some are different then others. some will do it, some wont do it. for people that want to help the community they can help around by a park, help old people, help old people cross the street and do all that for no money but just for the thought of helping people.

i believe you should make it an option ether yes or no.

please read this as soon as possible thanks sincerely 8th grader STUDENT_NAME
