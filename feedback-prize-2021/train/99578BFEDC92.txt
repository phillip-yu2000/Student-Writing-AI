You are laughing with your friends and trying something new. After school activities opens your eyes to new things that maybe you wouldn't have thought about earlier and help you find friends that are interested in your same interests. Extracurricular activities are important for students to meet new people, get good exercise, and explore possible hobbies.

Sports are not only a great way to make friends but also are also beneficial in having good exercise.

When you play sports you are on a team with people that you may not know or people that you normally wouldn't talk to but through playing with them you can become friends. Sports can be a fun way to get exercise for instance if you join a basketball team you learn to play the game at the same time as having fun with friends and traveling to play other teams. There are a lot of sports to chose from which means that there is something for everyone to play and enjoy. Sports are just one of the activities that help you make friends and get good exercise.

Student council is perfect for people that want to effect change in their community or school. The SCA is a great learning experience for students to learn about public speaking and talking to large groups of people. You can have a big influence in your school by setting up events that bring people together or by just making a fun day for students. You can create events that will help the environment or people in need like a food drive or planting plants. The student council is a great way to get involved and also do fun things as well.

Music is another option of activities to chose from that engages people and teaches them how to play pieces of music. Your music can travel you to different places to play and can help you meet new people. The new music that you learn can challenge you to be a better musician. With music there are many components and instruments which means that every one has a important role and job to do. Music is another great option of activities that you can chose from.

After-school activities provide multiple ways for students to try different things, have fun, exercise, or continue to participate in things that they like. Sports are a great way to get exercise while still having fun and meeting new people. The SCA is one option of activities that engages students, helps the community, and also does fun things in and out of school. Finally music is a great way to try new thing whether that be trying new instruments or even new music styles. I agree with the principles decision because they are helping students try new things, meet new people, and being able to have fun with friends.
