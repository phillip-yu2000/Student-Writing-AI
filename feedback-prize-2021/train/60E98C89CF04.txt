I agree with this 100%. Choosing an Extracurricular Activity is very important. Let me tell you why

Extracurricular Activities can help with Social Skills. For Example if I am suffering from depression it gives me the chance to do something that would take my mind away from the depression. Another reason would be if you have anxiety you can play or choose an activity that relaxes you and just lets you escape from all the anxiety around you. One major point is working better with other people. Extracurricular Activities can help you as a learner work better with others. For Example my Granddad is in the Construction business and when you have jobs like that and teaching and pretty much any job you have to know how to collaborate with other people. This brings me to my final point Extracurricular Activities can help your Social Skills.

These Activities can help with Social Activity as well. Like for example it give people who might not have friends or the best of friends a chance to make new ones whether it is through Sports or another type of Club. Another reason is because it gives you the opportunity to get closer and create a bond with friends and maybe even family. Plus there are many different clubs to choose from. These activities can help you stay fit and healthy as well. It also gives you the opening to meet new teachers and coaches that you might be able to start a bond with.

There are many different options to choose from. If you like sports you could play football or basketball or even soccer or baseball. If you like to test your brain power you can join chess or checkers club. And last but not least if you like to speak in front of people public speaking. This is one of my classes that I strongly encourage people to take to help with speaking in the workplace. Art is another option if you like being creative.

So my conclusion is choosing an Extracurricular Activity is important especially in High School and College.
