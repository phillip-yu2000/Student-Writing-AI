Venus is the hottest planet in our solar sytem. It could also be one of the most dangerous planets too. In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author thinks its a good idea to strive furter into exploring Venus even with the dangers the planet contains.

One of the reasons the author beleives we should keep finding new things about Venus is because it was though to be similar to Earth. Venus and Earth are even called "twins" because they are thought to be so alike. Venus was thought to once be covered in oceans that could have possibly supported life at a point in time. Venus also contains similar things to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. The only way we could figure more things out about Venus would be if we cept sending thigs such as rovers to research it and possibly humans one day.

Another reason the author thinks we should find more information about Venus is because Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in our solar system aside from Mars. Venus or Mars would be the next step in our space exploration. If we do send rovers or people to Venus one day, we would need things that could withstand the heat and other chaos that happens on the surface of Venus. The author states that NASA has came up with an idea that contained a blimp-like vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface of Venus that would carry scientists and would allow them to study the surface. The temperatures inside the blimp would be about 170 dagrees Fahrenhet and air pressure that would be close to sea level on Earth. The conditions would be rough, but humans can withstand it.

Though Venus is dangerous, that doesnt mean it's not possible for humans or rovers to explore its surface one day. Humans are driven by curiosity that leads us into similar places. If we can make it to the Moon, we can most likely one day make it to Venus and back. If humans were to one day even land on Venus, it would be a giant achivement for the human race.
