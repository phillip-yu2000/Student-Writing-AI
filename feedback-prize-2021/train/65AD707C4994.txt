In this article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" they have both postive things to say about this and they have negative things to say about cars.

First, my position on driverless cars to me is a good thing because if you have to parallel park in between two cars and you're not very good then thats when the car can do it and park it perfect for you.

It's also good because say if you're texting and u drop your phone and go to pick it up and there is a car in front of you...then the car would automatically stop for you so you dont crash.

Second, It's bad because you never know when the car can mess up on you. But f anything does happen then it wont be your fault it would be the manufacturing people's fault for not checking to see if everything is good with the car. Some people wouldn't even want a driverless car because they will get bored waiting for their turn to drive.

In the end it all depends on whether or not you want a driverless car, but there are going to be very nice driverless cars in the future. I would get one but I would want it tested before I buy it because I wouldnt want to spend a lot of money on a car that didnt work like the manufactures said it would. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars drives themselves by 2020.
