i think that we shouldn't have to have a b average we should be able to play sports and have to not worry about keeping up are grades i mean sure we have to keep up are grades but we should be able to do the sports that we want with out getting are grades up i mean we should keep or grades up with at least a c average that's very good to have a c i mean you ever know that. that person my not have the best grades but they could be really good at that sport and it could do a lot of good for the school .and they could get famous one day and they could thank it all to or school and then every one would want to go to are school because of that person that played a sport and had a c average.

so no i do not consider changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average . Many students have a C average
