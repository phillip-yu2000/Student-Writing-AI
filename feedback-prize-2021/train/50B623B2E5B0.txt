Dear Principal,

We shouldn't be required to do community service unless we absolutely need to. Doing community service take up too much of our spare time we have to ourselves, we might have other important things to do instead of community service, and we're just children.

One of the reasons is, it takes up too much of our spare time. Our spare time is the only time we have to ourselves that we can actually enjoy. With that time, we can just have fun and enjoy ourselves. We can watch movies or play video games.

Another reason is, we could have other important things to do. Instead of community service we could be doing something else productive. Such as chores at home or just helping out friends with things they need help on. Also students may have assignments that they need a lot of time to finish.

Most importantly, we're just children. As kids we should be able to enjoy our life and act like actual kids. We should have the decision to have fun. Kids should feel free to play and have fun with friends and family.

So those are reasons why students should not be required to do community service. It takes up too much of their spare time, we may have other important things to do, and we're just kids. So we shouldn't be given so much work to do.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
