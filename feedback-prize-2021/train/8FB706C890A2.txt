You are going to hear different anwsers from all types of people with different opinions on a lot of things, when you ask multiple people for advice on something you can find out new and better ways to solve a problem, therefore you can get a greater understanding of whatever your seeking advice for.

After you have gathered different advice from people you should make a better choice then the one you thought before you asked those people for advice.

Asking advice alone is a good idea but when you ask a bunch of people you also can obtain a lot of knowledge from that individual that could stick with your for a while.

after a bit it gets stuck in your brain and you get to add on to your already known knowledge to make it even greater than what it already was.

You also get more mature and find the better choice of any situation, obviously you won't be perfect but you will be better than before for sure.

It is most likely that you will find more knowledge by people that are older than you and are more wise.

Like your parents you can find advice from both of them, or older siblings. You can go a step further and go find advice from your family, for example your grandparents. the point is the more you ask the better you are off.

For example you are trying to figure out which study method you should use in Spanish to succeed.

You ask your Spanish teacher and she says that you should use her quizlet that she puts up on Google classroom, because it has a lot of materials.

Then you ask your mom for advice and she says she likes it best the old fashioned flashcards.

You take in both of those opinions into account and you decide to do the older way of doing flashcards.

In the example you can see that I got influenced by both sides and got multiple opinions in this situation, which led me to making my decision.

Which was the better choice in the end.

Another example is that you don't know what to write about for your essay in English class.

you ask your teacher and he says that you should do whatever your passionate about or just like in the section of writing prompts.

Your friend tells you to go with the easy way out and get an easy grade on the essay with and easy prompt.

You take your English teacher and friend into account and chose your English teachers way of doing the essay and you get a good grade on the essay.

As you can see in the example I took advice from both of them and chose the better choice in the end.

To conclude my prompt the point is that You are going to hear different anwsers from all types of people with different opinions on a lot of things, when you ask multiple people for advice on something you can find out new and better ways to solve a problem, therefore you can get a greater understanding of whatever your seeking advice for.
