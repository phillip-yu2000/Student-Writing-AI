Venus is the second planet from the sun. It is the closest planet to Earth of density and size. Venus is the brightrst points of light in the night sky for many can see it. Since Venus is sometims near Earth people have sent many spacecraft to land on it.

Each times they sent a spacecraft it was not successful because the surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid, and atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. Even though Venus is so inhospitable astronmers are fascinated by it because it's once believe to been Earth-like long ago. In the text it said, " The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary compeling idea for sending humans to study Venus." They make the spacecraft hovering over Venus so it avoid the bad ground condition. It will be thirty- plus miles above the surface but it will still will be very hot around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but pressure is close sea level of Earth. People are striving to meet the challenge to show Venus has value, not because to gain insight on the planet.
