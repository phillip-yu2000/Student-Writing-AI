Driverless cars are more of a reality than we think. With all of the new technologies advances in cars, driverless cars aren't just a dream anymore. Although driverless cars can be beneficial, there are just too many risks and consequences for them to be assist with everyday life in a positive way.

Technology is one of the greatest risks with driverless cars. Once driverless cars are available to the public, there are many things that could go wrong. Fluxes in weather could cause major issues within the driverless cars that would have very expensive repairs. Remodeling streets to incorporate driverless cars would be "simply too expensive to be practical" [3]. Car thiefs now only have to hack into cars to steal them. If the technology within the car fails, are all of the passengers stranded? Malfunctions can also cause accidents killing passengers and pedestrians nearby.

The next question is, "if technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver of the manufacturer?" [9]. There will be countless driverless car court cases to decide if the passengers were at fault, or if the technology was to blame. There are more serious court cases to deal with than a surplus of citizens verus technology. Also with their steady supply of resources such as good lawyers, companies have a solid chance at winning majority of these cases and not having to own up to their mistakes. As a result of this, innocent citizens now have to pay these have fees that could ruin their lives.

On paper, driverless cars seem like a great idea, but in reality they could cause many horrible effects. Technology advances on cars that will help with safety are always beneficial, but having a car driver by itself could be harmful.
