Dear principle,

I respect that you want us to take community service to help the environment. And I am willing to spend my time to do it. This is a good way to help mother nature and the Earth. Other people may think that this is absurd work. They are just too lazy to stand up for themselves and finally do something right for the community. They have no reason to object this kind of offer! If they object, then they have no reason to be an American citizen. That may be harsh , but that is the truth. No matter how harsh this objective is to help the community, I will gladly do my best. after all that is said I will take part on this community service that you provide for the school. I believe with my honest heart that two thirds of the students will accept your kind offer. They are willing to take part on this amazing community service that you are holding for us. You have made a perfect decision to give out community service for your students. Before there were community service, the Earth was a piece of trash. But, since people and students are taking action, they are finally cleaning the mess. Now, the Earth is becoming to clear up. Therefore we could smell the fresh air instead of the polluted air. We still need to take part to make the Earth 100% fresher and cleaner for us to smell. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Your student
