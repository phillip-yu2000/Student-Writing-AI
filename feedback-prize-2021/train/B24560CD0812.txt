In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). I think the that the technology should be used in classrooms because it can detect the emotion of the students. I think it would be good because the technology cna se if the students are getting tired or they are angry about somthing or sad about something. This technology would be good for teachers to they can see if someone is getting bored and they need to change the lesson a little bit or they student is getting tired and they can get the student(s) up and moving around so they are not tired. Another reason I think this technology would be good is because if the students are working on homework or a project in class they can see the student(s) emotion change and see if the student(s) like what they are worki ng on based on they facial expression. My final argument why this technology would be good for in the classroom is because if you are watching a movie in class the teacher can detect your facial expression and see if you are enjoying what you are watching or if you are upset or angry about what you are watching.
