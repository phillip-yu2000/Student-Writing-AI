BOOM!! You're on I-75 on the ground bleeding out watching everyone surrounding you, calling 911.

At this point you're thinking to yourself, "why the freak did this happen?" A couple hours later you found out an adult was on his phone texting and driving before the wreck happened, which is the most selfish thing to do while driving. Putting your life and other's lives in danger just so you can send a stupid text to your girl/boyfriend is completely selfish. I firmly believe that we need stricter phone laws to in jail people.

Texting while driving is in the top five causes for deaths, and yet many states do not have laws against it. We need to stand together united and encourage our Congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distraction.

and be mature and adult-like and discuss ways to not further endanger each other.

Cellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it, but I know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change. What's more important to you: a notification or somebody's life? Our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make the roads safer for everyone, we as people need to come together an decide what to do to make things happen, we don't know how much more accidents have to happen in order to push it into effect.

We dedicate our selves to our phones,we cant go 10 minuets without trying to see if we got a notification, the time we spend on our phones is tremendous its up to 6 hours a day! Not including the time spent in your bed! If there were something to happen to all of our phone we would go insane,if we would just make stricker laws for phone an driving the people would stop because of the consequences.
