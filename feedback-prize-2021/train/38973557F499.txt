The author very well demonstrates that the idea of studying Venus, despite the risks, should continue forward. The author mentions previous times where NASA has sent probes and such to Venus and explains the failures and why the probes don't survive the landing very long. When explaining the type of features Venus has, the author mentions that it has signs of physical features that Earth has right now. The author states that some of the familiar features are valleys, moutains, and craters and probably convered in oceans. A lot like Earth. By addressing the fact that Venus has signs of similar physcial features as Earth, the author makes the point that if we continue to study Venus we can learn more about Earth and what could possibly happen to Earth. It makes the reader more convinced to side with the author. The author also mentions how we could do missions while staying safe but still find out information about Venus. The author lists a danger then adds a way to avoid this danger and be safer which makes the point of continuing to explore Venus more appealing. For example, in paragraph 5 the author states the conditions of the atomosphere and land then gives the solution of hovering 30 miles off the ground of Venus. Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet. The author supports the idea of by conducting more studies and missions, it would further our knowledge about Earth very well.
