Dear Principal,

I believe that community service is a good deed and that everyone should be required to at least do some kind of community service.

Also, all students should be require to do at least one kind of community service per school year.

For example, they could hold a day where they go around the community and pick up trash.

They could also do something easier like tutor elementary school students.

It doesn't have to be something hard, as long as they affect the community in a positive way.

If the student doesn't do community service at least one time in the school year, then they wouldn't get their final report card until they complete one community service activity.

So that means that their parents are not going to be able to see their report card until they complete it.

If students don't know what kind of community service to do, our school has a community service club where students help the community in a variety of ways.

It is fun because you can meet new people in this club.

Also, you can get to know your community better.

It also helps you to complete one community service by the end of school year.

It is a fun and easy way to complete this task.

To prove that each student did a community service, they would have to have a parent signature on a form that explains and verifies that they completed it.

But if they join the community service club, they would just need to get the club supervisor's signature.

Also they should be required to turn in a reflection about the community service they did with their form so we know what kind of community service they did.

If they don't turn in that form and the reflection by the end of the school year, then they would have to suffer the consequences.

So that is why I strongly believe why all of our students are required to do community service.

It is a good way to help students become better people.

Sincerely,

Student
