Dear Principle,

I think I am going to agree with you on that because i feel that school should be first over sports. For these reason: one students maybe really good at the sport they play and maybe someday would like to become professional, but if they had bad grades no school is going to want to except them. A second reason is that they should be more interested in thinking about passing the grade they our in that playing sports. My last reason is their future, they will get no where in life having bad grades like that.

My first reason being the fact that students maybe really good at the sports they play, but once that sport is over and they have all failing grades and will have to suffer the consequences of doing all kinds of make up work to boost their grades up. Then they will become behind and everything will all be a mess.

My second reason being that they shouldn't worry about the sport they are playing, they should worry about the grade they are in and being able to move to the next grade and be able to play the sport again next year knowing that they passed.

My last reason being that if students are in high school they should start to worry about their future and if they will be able to go to a good college and get a good job to support their family's. Not almost be failing classes over sports that they may not even be the best at. Now if they are maybe try and convince them that if they are failing being good at that sport doesn't mean anything.

These are the reasons why I would agree with you about students having a B average grade rather that a C. That way they are passing there classes and not worrying about failing.
