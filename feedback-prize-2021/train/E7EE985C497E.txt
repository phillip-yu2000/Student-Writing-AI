I can see that you migth of think that the "Unmasking the Face on Mars.". Might be created by aliens but it's not. I have information that this natural landform is not ceated by aliens. "Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.". This is saying that the natural landform is formed by shadows.

And another thing is that they went again to see if they could take a picutre again of the natural landform but, they had a better camera they would allow them to see better if it was true that the natural landform was true. " Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 metters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.". That is saying that they got a better camrer, its can see more thing that the other camera could not see.

This is another example that the camera can see that the other camera could not see. " So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!". that us saying that it can focus from farther distance.

The last thing I will tell you is what they found out about the picture they took with the better camera and to see if it was ture or not. That the "Unmasking the Face on Mars.".

Was created by aliens or the shadow was making it look like a face. " What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte mesa."

In conclusion all of this "drama" was for nothig becuas it was not created by aliens it was just mother nature that did all of this. All it was the shadow that maked it looked like it had a face.
