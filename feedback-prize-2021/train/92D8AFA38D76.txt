I think it's better to have a car because people that are driverless would get all lazy because they don't have to drive. People that needs to learn how to drive wouldn't be able to because they cars drives by itsself. People shouldn't be lazy to drive. Maybe one day when your in a hurry and the car you got is driving so slow that your going to be late to your appointment or whatever you going to. It would nice if they cars could tell them turn her or watch out or something like that. So the car can warn you guys incase of accendent.

People should be responsible to drive theirselves to wherever they want to go. What if the car breaks down?? They won't have a way to go anywhere without it working. They would still have to buy the pieces or whatever to fix the car. if it was your own car you wouldn't even mind to buy the stuff you need because you know it's yours. Most people would be walking to places they need to go for the same reason of not having a car. The car could hurt the drivers. Safety is the most important thing in any car in the earth. People that drive with car be getting into acciedents imagine having cars that drives themselves. It would be worser for people. If the car goes to the other way where its not suppose to and get hit the person is the one that going to get the consequences for the cars action.
