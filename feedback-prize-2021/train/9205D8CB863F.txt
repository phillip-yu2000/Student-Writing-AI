I like the idea of a driverless car. I say this because, if they were to make these cars it would possible make it much safer to drive. There may be less deaths caused by car crashes and someone getting hit by another person driving. People would never get lost on the road so they may get where they need to go and be on time. This would also be good because it would cause people to use less fuel.

This would help people that are not very good with directions to find what they are looking for. If it was a computer driving the car it would have a lot less mistakes while driving. If we were to put sensers around the car it would activeate the brakes on individual wheels if nessacery. If they were to make a driveless car it would cause less traffic jams.

These are the reasons i would like a driverless car and why other people should have one too. It is much safer, it uses less gas, it could help a lot of people out with directions and their time being used in the years to come.
