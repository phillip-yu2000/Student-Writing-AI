Whether it's being on a sports team or taking extra classes, I think it is a good idea for all students to do an extracurricular activity. I agree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities because students can interact with new people and it will improve home and school life.

The first reason students should participate in after-school activities is they can interact with new people. Students will have opportunitiesÂ to make new friends during it. They can learn teamwork by interacting with other people, including coaches, teachers, and kids. Also, students can learn many other life skills by meeting new people. For example, they learn collaboration by working with others on a sports team or working on a group project. Interacting with new people is great for students and their futures.

Another reason to support extracurricular activities is it improves students home and school life. Students can earn better grades because others, their teachers or coaches for example, will encourage it. Some activities require good grades in order to do them. Less fortunate students could escape to their activities to forget problems they may have at home. Additionally, students can have trusted relationships with adults in their activities so if they have problems, they can talk to them about it. Students need to have good home and school lives now so they can focus on their future. An extracurricular activity can help them do that.

In conclusion, I agree that all students must participate in extracurricular activities. It helps students make new friends and learn teamwork. Also, you can learn different life skills from the activity. It improves home and school life by earning better grades and having places to go to when you need it. Another good thing about it is you have many adults you can trust and talk to about situations. After-school activities is a great experience for students and is a good idea for everyone to do it.
