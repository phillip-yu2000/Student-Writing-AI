Dear Principle,

I support your idea that students should have atleast a C average in order to join after school sports and clubs. My reason for this is that I think by having a reward for getting passing grades students would try harder to do well in school. Secondly I also think it would help teams to do better at a sport since they would have people on the team who would be dedicated to what they are doing since they worked so hard to get on there. Also students will help their friends do better in school if they can both join the same club or sport. This would teach students how to study and be responsible. Most importantly this would give extra curricular activities some meaning since students will be interested in what they joined and will try hard to achieve everything thing can in it.

Thank you for you're time,

Sincerely ,STUDENT_NAME
