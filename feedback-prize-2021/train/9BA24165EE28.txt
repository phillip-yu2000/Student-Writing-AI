I believe that driverless cars are not the best answer to drving. To me it's just another reason to make america or the whole world to be lazier. Yes it would be nice to have a taxi service that doesn't have a driver, but what about the people who drove those cars for a living, they would be put out of buisness.

When making a new car safety is key, in order to make such a car you have to be sure that everything is optimal for consumors to buy. If one car goes malfuntioning that would be bad for the company. Although the idea defeats the point of the driverless car. When people are stuck in traffic they don't want to sit there behind the wheel moving inch by inch, but the car cannot drive in such conditions as close traffic, consrtuction, sites or around accidents, Which is one of the reasons people want the auto driving car so they don't have to sit through that.

So to me driverless cars need more improvement in safety and manuverbility, or they're not going to get many sales on this product, and if it is produced many people will complain and probably end up with lawsuits and refunds.

On the other hand though if this idea was a possibility with more safety with no driver needed at all then any company that perfects the production first will be very rich indeed.
