To this day our technolodgy has become alot more advanced. So much that even driverless cars are being built. But is it really as awesome as it sounds?

Many companies are developing new ways to make the world more advanced, widescreen cellphones, smart cars, virtual ways of exercise. So much infact that the thought of driverless cars are being made into reality. It is stated that the Google cofounder envisions a future of driverless cars to offer transport and use half the fuel of todays ways of transport. That sounds like a good deal to some people, but what of the dangers they could cause?

In America our lawmakers put the thought of safety in our drivers and pedestrians first. To pass a law of driverless cars wouldn't that mean they would have to be safe enough to have around people? today with our modern cars we have cautious driver in the seats able to watch the road and avoid certain issues. Would a driverless car be able to do so? Even now accidents are hard to be prevented, but in a vehichle without a person wouldn't people be even more liable? Not to mention the large amounts of money that would need to go into making each fleet of cars. Even more money than what we put into our natural cars today. In the story it also talks about having to redo our roads which would cost more than the cars!

I think that driverless cars would be more dangerous than cars with drivers. Before we know it they will want to make thousands of pilotless planes. Unless they already have.

We can become more advanced in differnt ways. If we were to have driverless cars could'nt they be used for special jobs instead of transportation of people? Why no transportations of goods? I personally belive driverless cars are a good idea, just not a safe one.
