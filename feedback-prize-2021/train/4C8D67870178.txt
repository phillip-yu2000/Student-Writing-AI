Dear Mr. Senator,

The electoral college is a terrible way to vote for the president. It's not fair to the people and there's always the chance of the disaster factor!

First off, the electoral college is unfair to the people. It's like your actual vote doesn't matter, because in reality your just voting for another voter. For example when a president wins the popular vote, it doesn't matter! So the peoples real opinion means nothing. Because the only thing that counts is actually who wins over the electoral college. So who knows how many people there are who voted for the president that lost the electoral college's votes but won the popular how outraged they must be! In article 2 they have a really good point "It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."(p14) Which basically means that to the people the electoral college doesnt make much sense, and there vote doesn't exactly even count. This is only one reason that the electoral college needs to be thrown out!

Second of all, the electoral college always has the chance of the disaster factor. When the states voter doesn't vote for who his is supposed to! Or when the state replaces the voter with someone who will do just that. In article 2 they  have a great example "Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"(p11) So the disaster factor is always a potential threat which is why the electoral college should be abolished!

To conclude, the  electoral college needs to be abolished because there is always the chance of the disaster factor, and it's unfair to the people it's like their vote doesn't even matter!
