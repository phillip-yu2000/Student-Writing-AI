Student should participate in sports and other activities, when they have good grades below 70 or above, because its not fair for other students to be in fun activities and not be doing well in school work also. Basically its like a reward to be in sports in school to have the ability to do well in school also. Most students argue about being kicked out on a team because of their grades, they think that grades aren't important in their lives but later on it might will, depends what you want to do in their life.

I personally agree with both but more I agree with doing well in school first. Like other parents say "School comes first" and its actually true sometime. Most people think school is just a place to be with your friends and joke around, but clearly you can joke around with your friends and also learn about what your going to do with your future life too. When students want to be a professional player in sports you need to have a scholarship for college if you want to be in football, baseball, basketball, and much more activities. College is something that everybody is proud of, like your own parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and much more family members. I have friends tell me all the time that they want to be in the NFL or in sports but when they do school work, they don't do well or they don't want to do the work that they assign to them.

When people say that they don't want to do they school work and that they just want to be with their friends, I mean nobody likes to do the school work either but eventually we going to have to do it once in a while also. Everybody has to do it but just only yourself, it might seem like you are just the only one that's doing the work but like I said everybody has to do it. That's a path for you and people so that they can go to college and have a good education. Maybe later your own children and look up to you jus
