Phones and Driving

Mostly today all of us are on our phone and some people cannot focus on driving instead just begin in their phones. I think that people should be able to use their phone while driving while operating a vehicle. It can cause us to get distracted while we are sending a text to someone but there is a car coming in beside you and you do not notice them you don't have enough time to react. I think that most people would say that it was the others car fault, but we must be able to focus on only driving nothing else. Also, if you see a pedestrian you must be alert if they are crossing the road and do not slow down then it can cause you to hit them while texting. The pedestrian thought is that you would slow down so they can cross across the road so they will not be thinking about you still going forward. Some of the states are making it illegal to text and call others while operating a vehicle because I feel that your reaction time is slow which causes you not to focus on one thing. Also, because if you behind a car and the other car hits the brakes but you will have no time to react on the brakes, but causes you to hit the other car but you will get the blame because you had enough time to push the brakes. I feel like if you are talking on the phone you might be concentrated on driving and talking but texting does not give enough time to look on your phone and driving with the other hand I feel like that is what can cause you to wreck. These are the main reasons that I think that people should use their phone can cause distractions while operating a vehicle even though some people think it does not distract them.
