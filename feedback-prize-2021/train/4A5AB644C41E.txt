Seagoing Cowboys program is filled with adventures, and you could go to uniqe places.

In August 1945, I boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, and I has heading for Greece-with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. When I arrived in Greece I was 18, which meant I could be drafted for military service. When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. By the time I was discharfed in 1947, I had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

The cattle-boat trips were an unbelivable opportunity for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special, so was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

I also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys and I would play baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed. We would have Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also to help pass the time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up a new world for me. I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

So other people who want to be in the Seagoing Cowboys Program, you will have a adventure of an life time.
