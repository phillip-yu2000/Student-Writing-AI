"COMMUNITY SERVICE POLICY"

Dear principal,

Students ought to be proud to do community service and you should make it a rule. There is no other honor than to know you are doing something for your community. Community service is not just going around with a trash bag, you could help a lady cross the street. Community service can be beneficial, you could earn respect.

Just the thought of knowing I am helping the environment get me tickled pink. It is not a waste of time. You are doing this for a good cause, not to waste time. You could get honored at a ceremony by the mayor or someone. You could do community service by helping a lady across the street with her bags.

It can help to carry an old woman's bags across the street for her. That could have saved a life, or two. If you do community service in your neighborhood it can be a enormous factor on your personal appearance. Elders will start to respect you, that is a wonderful accomplishment.

Community service can be beneficial on you behalf if done properly. People will start to respect you in the town. You could walk in a store and everyone will stout your name. That is a wonderful feeling to have. Community service can do a lot for you if you take the time.

So principal I vote to carry out the rule. It could be use as extra credit in some issues. Community service should be part of school. Principal you have my vote fully. I guarantee to do community service everyday in school.
