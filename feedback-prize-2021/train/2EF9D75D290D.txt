Phone And Driving

There are a lot of people that text while driving. Even though there is now a law that says you are not allowed to text while driving. There are probably a few people you know that still text while driving. It's not just texting either people also talk on the phone while driving as well. I do believe drivers should not be able to be on the phone while driving a vehicle. Also in 2018 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use.

The zebra started a survey on people within the ages of 18-24 about texting while driving. Most of these respondents knew texting while driving was illegal. Would you believe me if I said that 36% of the respondents admitted to texting while driving. Out of the 36% of people who admitted it 51% of them admitted to being very aware that it was illegal. In 2018 4,637 people died in car crashes due to texting and driving.

In 2017 2,700 teens died do to drunk driving, even though that is still a lot over 10,000 teens have died due to texting while driving in the same year. When you are texting and driving you are 23 times more likely to get into an accident.

CONCLUSION

There is no reason you should put your life at risk just to see a text. That one text could be the last thing you see. It's not even just your life at risk it's all the people on the road with you that lives are also at risk. Just think about it next time your driving and you get a text. Should you read it while driving. Think of all the lives your risking.
