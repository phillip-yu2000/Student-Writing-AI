I think that we can help people in america by going over sea to help people all over the world. I enjoyed playing table tennis with my friends on board after we had deliverd the animals. We also used to play softball and soccer when we were done. I still remeber the time I saw the Panama canal, the Acropolis in Greece, and the time I took a gondola ride in Venice. If you lived on a farm this is a great oportunity for you. I hope you can join and learn to love it.

I think that you would enjoy it even more if you loved animals. I loved feeding the horses and cows. If you do join heres a tip, learn to love the animals and treat them very kind. Also dont spook the horses they are like big babies. The cows shouldnt be as bad but be careful anyway. I loved spending time with the animals. It was a great experince.
