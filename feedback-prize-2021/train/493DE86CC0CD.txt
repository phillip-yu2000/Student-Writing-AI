In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" the author displays many ways in witch these new additions to society can be a huge step forward in technology advances and also how they can cause problems. Google cofunder Sergey Brin believes in the driverless car and the safty of one. However, I strongly disagree with his outlook on the driverless car.

In paragraph seven the author displays one issue that makes these type of cars problimatic. This issue is that the cars still need assistance when it comes to applying human reasoning and human skills that a robot cannot control. This is where my concern for the safety of the cars is tested. What would happen if the car did not recognize the situation as a human task? Would the car be able to react like a human being? To me, the answer is no, i believe that a robot cannot be taught to think and perform like a human being.

In paragraph nine the law is the issue that is explained. In the article it states that that there is uncertainty between who would be responsible for injuries in an accident, the driver or the manufacturer? In my opionion this makes the cars even more of a threat. What if the manufacturer was to blame? Would individuals be more likely to get in an accident just for the money? Also presented in article nine is that in most of the states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars. Society does not trust the saftey of these cars so why should we.

In conclusion, I feel Driverless cars are a hazard to society. Their saftey is the main concern. Nothing in this world can function or respond like a human being like we can, so how can we trust our safety in the hands of a computer?
