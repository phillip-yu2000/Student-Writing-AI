Dear Principal,

I believe policy 1 is the best choice for our school. Even though phone usage is a problem there are many reasons students should at least have their phones. I see that during class, phones can be very distracting, but there are also a lot of useful places for a phone in a school day. Students may need their phones to contact parents, so they can inform them on afternoon activities. Phones may also be used to ask a friend to meet up for study hall so they can work on a project.

If students have their phones and an emergency occurs then they can use them to contact their parents for transportation, or inform them of their whereabouts. For most students a phone is a sign of security that serves as a lifeline to their parents. Faculty could easily monitor phone activity in the school by making shore kids had their phones in their backpack during class. Personally I don't see the phones being much of a problem if policy 1 was put into place.

Sincerely,
