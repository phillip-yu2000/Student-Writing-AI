Could you trust a car that drives itself? I know i could'nt and im going to tell you the reasons why. I think it is very dangerous and it would cause a lot of accidents. We'll see if I can change your mind about the driverless cars.

Now how could someone trust one of these things? It takes no energy to drive a car so how could people be so lazy to want a driverless car. Sure the car alerts you when your in danger but people fall asleep while driveing cars. So imagine how many people would fall asleep in a car that you do not have to do anything to operate it. Also imagine how much they would cost! A regular car is already a lot of money, so one of these cars would cost a ton of money. Also think about your kids don't you want themto actually learn how to drive? This world is already dependent on cumputers enough. It would also cost a lot of money to fix them beacause most ordinary people couldnt fix them. Wouldnt you rather have a car that you can fix yourself? If you know how to fix a regular car then it would save money because you wouldnt have to take it to a mechanic.

I hope I have changed you mind about these cars. I know they seem cool but they just would'nt be safe. Also it would cost a lot of money for one and a lot of money to fix one.
