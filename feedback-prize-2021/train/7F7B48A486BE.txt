community service

I

think that students should have to do community service. The students would help the community to come a better place. It might help the kids stay out of drugs and gangs. The students would help the environment for the community. The only thing kids about is the drugs and gangs.

If the principal made students that were bad do community service . It would keep most of them out of the drugs and gangs. I think that the principal should make kids do community service to keep them out of trouble. The community would make kids realize what they would do to their future if they got into the gangs and drugs. So i think that the principal should make kids do community service.

I think community service would be great for the students, so they can get their head off of school for a couple of hours. The principal should make the students do community service to help the city. Also to get rid of all the trash that's just laying around. Or maybe help clean up parks for kids and them to hang out on. Maybe they could help at a shelter home for a couple of hours and see what they might end up living in if they stay in the drugs and gangs.
