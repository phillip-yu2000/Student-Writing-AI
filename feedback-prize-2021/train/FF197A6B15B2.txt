Dear Principal my thoughts about having phone's in school i think you should let students use phone in their own spar time because they don't use it during class and its not fair that most teachers at the school can use them during teaching it is a big distraction when the phone goes off during a test or some important project, but it well help if you let the student use their phone so they can plan their day by letting their parent know where there going after school or other events like school activities like soccer, basketball, and other great stuff the school has provide for all the students.

The big idea about this is trust the students can not use their phone when ever if the students don't follow the rules you can stop phone use but, give it a try and see how well it works out for you but, make you do the right choice or have a vote for the whole school that's how it all work in the U.S. do what's best for your school.
