Dear Principal,

I do think that students should perform in community service because it is very important to clean up our school and also to have a very good environment or all the animals in the ocean will die and when we want to go to the Aquarium they will be no more animals to see. Why not you might asked because most of them will be dead or might be surviving a death full time. For Example if the students in out school start to perform community service our school will always be clean and its a great work to show team work and that anything that we try to do it will always accomplished. I also don't think its a waste of time because we never give time to start caring about our environment and start caring and helping about others people health.

See if the more we liter and recycle the more healthier our plant will be and if we don't help then our environment will be very dirty we won't be able to breath our nice natural environment instead will be breathing dirty stuff and we don't want that to happen because then everybody in the plant will die including the animal it's like the end of the world but because we didn't give time to take care of our plant and just decided to do something else less important than our health. However, that's why i think its important to recycle and liter.

Also, because it's a great time to use our teamwork and show our love to everyone and how much we care about there health and also a great way to make new friends and new changes to our school and our plant Hope you make all your students attend in community service.

Sincerely ,

Your dear Student
