I believe that we should have are phones but we should have them off during classes.

In my school we cant use them at all except after school. It would be great to use phones at lunch but for what for we don't use them at all here. But if I get or feel sick you cant contact your mom or who ever takes care of you. Sometimes the teachers don't let you go to the nurse if your sick they only tell you do it after class. Maybe you can be supremely sick of your stomach or a fever and the teacher might or might not let you go so then what will happen? Then if the teacher or the principal could let you contact your parents. I do believe that you can use cell phones but for emergency purposes and not to have them on in class because they take them away and then why would you want to text in the middle of the class. So I would want policy one than policy two I rather have a phone than not have one but only for emergency purposes and we don't need to use them for lunch but at least just to have a phone with you at all times. For when you get sick you have your phone at all times because you never know what might happen. So therefore I believe more in policy one to have are phones and I disagree in policy two to not have are phones at all.
