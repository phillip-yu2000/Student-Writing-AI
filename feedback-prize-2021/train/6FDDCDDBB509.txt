Essay over cell phone policies in school

Policy #1

Dear, Principal

The policy I believe is best for the student of are school is policy #1.

I think this because students should have more free time, and should be allowed to bring and to use cell phone during time out of class.

There is one that I disagree on in policy #1 is that student should not have to turn there phones of during time in class. I think this because phones such as iphones today are common to mostly all people. People should be allowed to use there phone for school work. Such as researching something for social studies.

All though student should have to turn cell phone off and put in a basket owned by the teacher during a test or a work sheet that is a important grade, and after the test or grade paper the student should be able to get there phone back. This should be done cause student will text the answers to other class mates.

if this policy is not accepted in school student will keep getting in trouble for using and having phones out.
