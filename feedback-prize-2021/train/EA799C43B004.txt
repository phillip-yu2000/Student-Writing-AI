Dear, principal

I say that a grade b average would be dumb because people sometimes don't understand what they have to do in school. But some people are not as smart as other people and don't get the help they need because they are afraid to ask because they say they will look dumb. Like on a test they will get it wrong because they don't know it and guess. Like me i' am not handing with books or school but i love sports. Just like this year I had a c average but was really good at sports you don't have to be smart to do ever thing. because for so people work really hard but they don't understand like the nerd's in the class. But sports is the only thing that keep people living the life they love. So why punish someone that cant get higher the a c average even know they work as hard as they can but still don't get the grades like some of the other kids.
