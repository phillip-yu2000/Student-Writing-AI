I think it's good to know people's opinion because it can help you deside on something you wanna do. Maybe that person has already tried the thing you wanna try he can give you his opinion on the item. If you wanna buy something first it's good to talk to someone who has bought the item they can tell you if it works or not. Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesn't work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car. Or if you wanna buy some medicen you have to ask first before you drink the medicen or else you can even die from it if it's bad for you.

And you have to talk to more then just one person to be sure because if you don't you can waste you money just like that. And you always have to be positive when people give you advice even you know they aren't saying things right they are just trying to help you. It's always good to give your opinion on things because maybe they aren't sure if they wanna buy the item or not. If you care about a person your going to give your advice to a person because they are some how confused on something you can help them. Giving advice is a way to be nice because you wanna prevent from that person to buy that item if they buy it and it doesn't work they are just going to waste money on the item.

Also by giving advice you can prevent people from getting hurt like if a guy walks to a store and buys something and it doesn't work he is going to come back to the store and fight the guy the sold him the item and then they both go to jail from fighting. Also if a parent comes to her friends house her freind can give her advice how to cook something maybe she doesn't know but her friend does and she can give her advice.
