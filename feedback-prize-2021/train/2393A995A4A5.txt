Dear Principal,

I think students shouldn't be aloud to bring their cellular devices to school because it will be a distraction. If you let student use them through out passing periods, lunch periods, or other free times it will encourage them to use it when they feel they need to. Instead of them doing their work they would text, use the web for social networking, listen to music, and etc.

Then you will begin to question yourself, why are grades dropping?, what are they learning?, and are they paying attention?. Well the answers to your questions would be, grades will drop because they aren't paying attention to what the teachers are teaching them. Student's need to spend more time off their cell phones gossiping about unnecessary things and focus on getting their work done and learning new things so that they would be successful in life.

They need to have their mind focused on one thing only and that is their education!

That is the reason why students do not need to have their cellular device out during any school hours.
