Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you should choose to allow students to bring their cell phones to school so we could use them during lunch and class passing times , as long as their off during classes . Because now the policy say's that we cant have our phone out at any time of the day unless its dismissal . And so when people get caught , we get in trouble and get a referral .

Which gets people suspended , And when your suspended you miss your work and can fall behind .Just because they got their phone taken away . Maybe it was their parent telling them something really important , or that a relative just past and their on there way to pick them up so get ready . Because they don't want to spend their time waiting for their kid to get their stuff when they could be saving time and get where they need to go . Or maybe something happens with a girl and her "cycle" and needs to go home and change . So she needs to tell her mom without going all the way across the school to the office with a big red stain . And that's my reasoning for the need of having cell phones out during lunch and class passing times .

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
