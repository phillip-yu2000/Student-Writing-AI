Dear Principle,

I think it would be a great idea to go with policy one. What it is really hurting if a student uses their cell phone at lunch or any other free time they have. I do agree that they cant have them during class because when we are in class we are here to learn in our classes. So what are we really hurting? So when you are done reading this will you please give this letter some serious thought for me.

With policy number one most kids in my opinion would love to use their cell phones during lunch or their free time, but don't get me wrong if they have them during classes I feel you teachers have every write to take them away. So going with policy one is the best way to go. Most kids would probably think that they have the coolest principle on the whole district. Really what does hurt if we use are cell phones during our only half an hour or our five minutes of passing time?

When we have are cell phones at lunch what or who are we really hurting? And when we have are cell phones during passing time its not going to hurt anyone if we have are cell phones during those times. And if we don't have them during classes I'm fine with that. It's just that I don't get why we cant have cell phones even during our lunch hour. That is the only free time that we get to have during our hour from 8:30a. m to 3:30p. m do you see where I am coming from?

So you see, what is the bad thing about having cell phones during passing time or at lunch. As long as we follow the rule about not having cell phones in class I think policy one is an excellent idea. So you see principle why I would go with policy one which states you may have your cell phones during free/passing time or during our lunch hour. So if you could take the time and think about what I just wrote about that would mean a lot to me. Policy one I think is the best policy and that's the policy I believe is better than policy number two.

Sincerely,
