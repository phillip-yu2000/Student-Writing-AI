Community Service

I think all students should be required to take community service. Taking part in doing community service would be helpful to our environment and other people. Some students should help by teaching little children helpful things. They can teach them how to read and write. This would help them by improving their levels in learning. Students should also do community service to help clean our community. A lot of people throw garbage everywhere not caring. Students can help by cleaning it up. This can help our community be clean and less polluted.

Helping old people would also be helpful. They can help take care of them in some ways and help by keeping their room clean for them. Old people, might like this because they get to see new people and enjoy being with a new person and not get bored all day. Another thing that they can help at is being helpful to kids that have a disability. They can play with them, teach them new things and help them in what they need. Doing this would really be helpful to those kids. Making the students in taking part in community service should be a great idea. Students helping out benefits many people, which is a good thing. This can make us experience new things. Most students stay home and do nothing, but they can really be helpful taking part in community service. For these reasons, i think students should be required to take part in community service.
