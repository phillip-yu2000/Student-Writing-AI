I agree with the principal decision about participating in extracurricular activity's. It will give the students something to do, instead of going home and doing nothing. The extracurricular activity could bring students together and create friendships. There are multiple actvity you can do such as sports, work on the year book, and serve on the student council. It will also get the student more involed with the school and make them feel more comfortable with other students. You don't need to participate in one curricular activity you could particpate in multiple activity's. It give you a chance to get better at something like sports if you have never played sports this gives you a chance to play and even get better at it. There are lots of oppurtunities that open up for you . You don't have to participate in the activity's every day. But if you do wanna come to the activity's you must particpate if not your free to go home. There will be times where you can talk with your fans and engage with others. working on your schools year book would be a nice way to connect with our students to.Â
