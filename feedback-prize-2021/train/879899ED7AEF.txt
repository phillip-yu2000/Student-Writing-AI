Dear Principal,

I disagree with changing to grade scale to play sports.

I don't have a B average in school that is why i have chosen to go against this idea.

A lot of student-athletes don't have a B average either.

This would cause a lot of us not to be eligible to play the sports we enjoy to play.

This would also lead us to losing a lot of our games and nobody like to be on a losing team.

So this would drop participation of sports and make them not as fun as they could be.

Playing sports is a social time for students and it lets them get to know each other better.

They are also help with exercise which a lot of kids don't get.

It allows students to have something to look forward to after school. Sports are very important to students.

I do agree that students have to put school before sports.

I think because a C is the average that's what i would expect out of some students.

Other students who have a B or a A Average that the should be expected to hold that grade if they want play sports for the school.

These are my thoughts on the grade change.

Sincerely,

Student
