It was actually quite simple to see that it was not created by aliens. If you look at the pictures, it acts as if it was like any other landform on earth. As humans, our mind is very good at creating a false idea because we want it to be it is that way. However, it is clearly shown that the faces were not created by aliens.

In the pictures shown in the article, the face changes as any fossil or landmark would on Earth. The jump from 1976 to 2001 is a big chance of what it would look like if it were on Earth. As said in the article, the JPL web site says it was a natural landform, not an alien monument. The only reason that the rumors of alien monuments still exsisted is because there were people who were still not satisfied.

Another reason that the alien monument rumors were false is because even with a cloudless day in Cydonia, it still appeared as a natural landform. Granted, the rumors of clouds blocking the actual image of the face was a logical argument. However, they even took pictures on a cloudless day, and it still appeard as a natural landform.

The theory that this was an alien civilization is totally inacurate. The pictures clearly show the actions of the face. Just because our imagination can create false ideas of life on another plannet, the evidence shows that acts and looks as a natural landform.
