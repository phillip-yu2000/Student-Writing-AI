I think that the Electoral College should stay because it it a good helper for electing a governer and a president. There are many differenty way of chosing a president, but this is the better ans easy one. One example that chouse how the Electoral College is helpfull is were it says, "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizenz." This is mostly saying that the votes help finda president by the most popular or voted person.

The secon evidence I found that shows that Electoral College is very helpfull is where it says," won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now." This shows how it is easy to get a president with this method, but it is not what they would prefer. Even though it is not what the prefer, it is the best, easy, and fair way to get a president.
