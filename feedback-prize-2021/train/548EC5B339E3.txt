When we talk about technology and ways to improve our life, What is the first think that come to our minds: Cell phones, computers, internet etc. However technology is also present in the field of the medicine, food daily life etc. Now you think that technology is Just cell phones computers and internet.

I'am pretty sure that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because you're attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like.

Student would get benefits in many ways. If they study from home and if they also go to the normal school they can graduate much early than the usual. They can find a job too, if they organize their time wisely. If they have a job so they could earn money and they can use to pay college.

If some student ask me I obviously recommend them to take online classes, it is a good way to improve your weakness and also you are going to be more success.

My conclusion is yes student get benefits in many ways when they take classes from home. and I think that every school should have the option to choose if the students wants to take online classes, and also is a good idea to help the student to be more success in the life.
