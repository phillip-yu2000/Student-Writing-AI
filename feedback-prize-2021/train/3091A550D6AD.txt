On May 24, 2001, NASA discovered a large, shadowy figure that resembled the shape of a human face on the surface of Mars. Some are to believe this figure was created by "aliens". Was it? Or is this mysterious likeness just something as normal as a natural landform?

Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976. The camera's absolute maximum was 43 meters per pixel. By looking at the photograph, you wouldn't be able to make a definate conclusion about what exactly the figure was and how it got on the surface of Mars.

Later, on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor was able to capture a photograph with an absolute maximum of 1.56 meters instead of 43 meters per pixel like in the 1976 Viking photo. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. Jim Garvin even said, "You can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"

Garvin also mentioned that they don't pass over the figure as a face very often and that what the image actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West.

Like I mentioned in the first paragraph; some are to belive this figure was created by aliens. Was it? Well, after receiveing all of NASA's evidental information, I would have to say it was not. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform created by natural causes; not aliens or even previous human life that may have once exhisted on the mysterious planet. People may have been hoping this was the time in history where aliens could've been discovered, but as we can tell, that moment in history is certainly and obviously not now.
