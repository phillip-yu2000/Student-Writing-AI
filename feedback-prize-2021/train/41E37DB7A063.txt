According to the text the challenge of exploring Venus is really worthy for NASA to explore or to know more about because all people know about venus is that Venus is really hot, nobody can go to venus.

The challenge of exploring venus is a pretty big challenge. Copious factors contribute Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to explore. Venus is the closest planet to earth why not find a way to explore it, Human have sent a copious of spacecraft in Venus but none of them survive the landing for more than a couple hours. Which is why we should find a way to get to Venus.

Venus as a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide makes it more challenging. Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees which is really high it's 90 times greater than our planet which make Venus really hot and challenging to explore. Venus condition is far more extreme than any human coud have imagine. If Venus is so inhospitable why is are scientist discussing on further visit to Venus? Maybe it's because it could be the only planet that is like earth, no one knows, which is why we have to know more about Venus no matter what it takes.

NASA has one idea for sending human to study Venus their idea is to fly over 30 or so miles above Venus, which sound like good idea because our pilots do it almost everyday to survive a storm while their flying a plane. More importantly, researchers cannot take a samples of rock or gas or anything else from a distance. Therefore they are trying to find a way to land on venus and take a good look so that they can know a little more about Venus our sister planet. Many of our researchers are working on a big project that would allow are machines last longer on Venus because Venus it's really hot.

The Challenge of exploring Venus is a big challenge, i think we will find a way to get to venus because if we got a lot of thing we got to know about our sister planet.
