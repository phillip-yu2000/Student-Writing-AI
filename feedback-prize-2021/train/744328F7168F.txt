Innovation for the future. That is what is occuring right now as you read this. Driving your own car is a thing of the past with the new up and coming invention of driverless cars.

New ideas are sprouting on how to make the semi-autonomous vehicle into a fully autonomous vehicle. Wasting your time by driving will be a thing of the past. Driverless cars would be an excellent invention due to the increased safety measures that will enable safer road conditions.

Google cars are semi-autonmous and have driven more than half a million miles without a crash which shows how safe they are. This is due to the increased safety measures that "still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents." This shows how the google cars are able to drive the easy, everyday road trips to work, school, or home; which is what the majority of one's car is used for. Yet, when the car encounters a circumstance that is more complicated, it will not try to navigate through the complicated circumstance, but instead alert the driver to take over. This shows how safe the car is because it is able to notice when a situation is too complicated for it to handle and then alert the driver of the impending situtation. Therefore, google cars would increase the safety of road conditions.

BMW's Dr. Huber has researched ways that will sustain the driver's awareness in an autonomous car, even though the driver is not actually driving. BMW has stated that they will bring in heads-up displays that "can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take overÂ—something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern." This shows how the driverless cars inventors are thinking of every aspect to these new driverless cars, not only the manufacturing aspect, but also the psychological aspects. The displays will sustain the driver's attention even while they are not actually driving, but will turn off the instant the driver needs to take over. This is much safer than what we have today because these displays are not something available to the majority of people who text and drive. Therefore, the new driverless cars will increase safety due to their innovative way of sustaining the driver's attention.

Also, the sensors in today's car have increased safety, which shows how sensors in the upcomign cars will only increase safety even more. Some vehicles have sensors and "the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone." The anti lock brake system has created safer road contions due to the fact that the sensors do the work so the driver does not have to. As the driver brakes, the information from the sensors alerts the car on how much pressure to apply and so forth, thus enabling the car to come to a quicker stop which increases the safety on roads. This shows how the driverless cars would be able to do all the work for the driver which increases the safety.

All in all, driverless cars would make the roads a safer place due to technological innovation. The many positive aspects that the driverless cars would provide would make the world a much safer place to be. So the next time you don't feel like driving, think of the up and coming driverless cars.
