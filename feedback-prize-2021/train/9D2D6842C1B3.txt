Dear principle,

I understand that you want us students to get better grades, and maybe that's why you are doing that policy. But many students like me don't think its fair. We think its better if we have a C average instead of a B average, because many students have a C average. The students with a F or D average wont get a chance to participate in any sports because of their bad grades. C isn't a bad grade after all. It will be really unfair if the students with C average cant participate in sports like the people with poor grades. One of the reasons why the new policy should change is because C isn't a bad grade like F and D. Another reason is because sports are good for our health and everyone should have a chance to play sports. If you chose to keep the policy how it is, you should at least change it to a C average. Or if you choose to take the policy off it would make the day go brighter. The students with C, D, or F should stay after school for tutoring instead to try to bring their grades up.

Sincerely,
