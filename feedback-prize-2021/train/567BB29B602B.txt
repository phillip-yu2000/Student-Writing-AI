If you want to believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens, that is fine, but we have evidence that it was not. The reason behind this is that like a lot of parts of Earth, it all naturally happened. Even if we find a clearer picture we have comfirmed in 2001 that it was just another natural landform And in the more clear picture, this face is the same as buttes or mesas commonly fond in the American West.

As we have been looking for more evidence we have gotten clear picture one after one, just to show that there was nothing left behind from aliens at the time. That was just the beginning. If we really have found a ancient artifact, then we would have started collecting small bits and pieces to examin them. Now, lets say that we did find that aliens created these lanndforms. We probably would have let more pictures to be seen to show proof of what we found.

Yes, there was also a thing during our winter where that everything on Mars is also hazy so that could be why we have been left to conclusion that it just naturally happened. However, if the monument gets abandoned every once in awhile then there could tools and items left back at it. If a landform was man made or in this case alien made, then there would be mistakes made, changes every once time.

As in an article that was read not that long ago, Jim Garvin says that the face on Mars looks about the same height as a Middle Butte in Snake River Idaho. This means that it was no matter what others say, it is just a natural landform that has just happened to look like a face. As from what Garvin said, "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

For that being so, the face is not an alien monument. The landform just has happened to be there and look like some face. Which if you still want to believe in the fact it could an alien thing that is fine. We have no alien evidence at all.
