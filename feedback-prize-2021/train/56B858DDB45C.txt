Although some say schools should offer distance learning classes because that way students have more time to do other activities and do their work from anywhere they are, actually school should not offer distance learning classes because students get distract at home and they do not learn as much as being in school.

Some school say schools should offer distance learning classes because that way students have more time to do other activities for example: help their mothers to clean the house,do laundry or to cook. They also have the opportunity of working on their work from the library, from their friend's house and even if they are on a trip, they can still do their work.

Schools should not offer distance learning classes because students get distracted by their brothers, by the TV and by the phone. They can not focus on what they have to do, even if they know there is a lot of work that they have to get done.

Schools should not offer distance learning classes because they do not learn as much as being in school, they can not do projects that help students to learn more about the class they are taking, also they do not interact with people as they do in school.

For that reason schools should not offer distance learning classes because students do not focus, they get distracted and they do not to well in their classes as they do at school.
