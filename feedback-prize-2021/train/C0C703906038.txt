Driverless cars are seen in fantasy films, books , and Tv shows but none of this truely wonderful dream been seen in the real world.. That could all change because by the year 2020 a lot of the big car companies such as Mercedes, nissan etc are planning to maek Driverless vehicles. The invention of driverless cars can be a good or bad thing it depends on the way you look at it.

Driverless cars are coming with a lot of new technology such as cameras to see if the driver is focused on the road, on the windshield there will be heads-up displays, the car would use half of todays fuel, and more flexibility then a bus. Some cons of driverless cars can be the price of such technology in a vehicle, the price for companys to manifacture the car, and always if the technology fails and someone gets injured, hurt, or dies on the road who would we blame for the incident? Who is justice served to the driver or the manufacturer?

In conclusion I think they should not create a truly Driverless car there are many cons that come along it and the biggest and most important i believe is going to be the price of the vehicle. A car with a driver is a lot more safer then we know if a incident happens we know who was responcible and why and how it occured. A pro they should add to Drivered car that they are going to add to driverless car is the fuel efficienty, because that is going to help us humans and the planet we live on. Goodbye and as always have a nice day.
