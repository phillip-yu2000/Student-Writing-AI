Dear Senator,

I think you should change to election by popular vote for the president on the United States because you can be certain of the outcome and you can avoid run off elections.

If you vote for something you want to be certain that it will win and someone won't change it to their liking. In the paragraph Certainty of Outcome it says "The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exeeds his share of the popular vote". Which is like saying he people should have a voice in voting for their next president. Also it says "A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-It happened in 2000". If their having problems with the Electoral College they should just take it out completly.

Who wants to have a run off election it just waistes time. In the paragraph Avoid Run-Off Elections it says "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast". Thats like saying they woulden't even care is the candidate had no majority votes in the cast. Another example is "There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast". Of course theirs pressure because they do anything right.

Thats why i thing they should change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states.Â
