Dear Principal,

To get a B in any subject is hard to achieve and all students have one bad subject which means less than ten percent of all students will be allowed to participate in sports and then most children and teens are either athletic or smart only about five percent are both so even less will participate even with those few being allowed to participate in these sports.

In the next paragraph I will explain more on what students will do to participate in sports or other activities and what this does to our school.

I think that the new policy would hurt our school in many ways.

Our students would drop out or change schools to participate in many sports. This could hurt the school as well. Money that comes out of school events that include all sports helps to pay for books and other learning material like paper, pencils, computers, notebooks, computers,

and workbooks.

This alone would hurt the school but as I said before children and teens need some sort of activities. To blow off steam or to get rid of some energy. Worst of all if they do drop out or move to a different school the amount of students at the school will drop dramatically as will it's grade point average.

As you can see changing the policy on sports will hurt our school in many ways. Less than half of the students will stay at the school.

The schools grade point average will go down and the school won't have the money to support the few that stay. Eventually the school will be shut down and all the teachers that work their will be laid off.

Sincerely,
