Dear Principal,

I think Policy 1 is better for the students and staff members because it is safer for students, reasonable, and it would make student's relationships with staff more positive.

A cell phone is a source of communication for students and in some situations we need it.

For example, a student might need a ride from a parent from school because of a schedule change.

If the student cannot contact their parent, they could be left at school, and that is very dangerous!

This policy is reasonable because when a student has a free period, they should be able to have freedom, and it's no secret that we, students, feel free when we text!

Having rules on when we would be allowed to use our phone would also encourage us to use good judgement.

Judgement is very important life skill for teens!

Teachers are constantly at our throats if they see a phone, and it creates complication and tension in our relationships. Having Policy 1 would be a compromise. Therefore it would eliminate the complication and tension, and students could focus on learning instead of sassing the teacher.

Policy 1 would be benefiting all parties involved, the students and staff, so it is the best choice.

Sincerely,

An 8th Grade Student
