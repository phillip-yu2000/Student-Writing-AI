Have you ever been stuck in sticky situation, where you really need help or advice?

I know I have and advice is very helpful, especially when you get it from multiple people.

As kids we are just a step into life right now, but what matures us and gives us knowledge is advice.

Advice is the key to life and wisdom.

Lets say your talking to your parents about asking a girl to prom.

Getting that help and advice from multiple people can really benefit you in multiple ways.

Getting advice from one person is helpful, but you don't know how they went through during that experience.

Like the prom example what if you asked your dad for help instead but he got rejected, he could make prom sound like a terrible thing.

Life without wisdom and advice is like a maze, you don't know what decision to make like you don't know if you should go left or right.

The knowledge you get going through life and what others tell you, is what you want to pass down to the next generation.

getting advice from multiple people is key to being wise and good at making quick decisions.

Advice from multiple different perspectives is probably the best advice you can get and will get.Â
