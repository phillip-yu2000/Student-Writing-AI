Twenty-five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spotted a giant shadowy figure that looked like a head on Mars. Many people belive that the "Face on Mars" was created by unknown life forms, but this is clearly not the case. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.

The Face on Mars is just a mesa that formed on the Red Planet. Mesas are very common around the American West, and it's no surprise that one could turn up on Mars. In paragraph 12, Jim Garvin states "It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."

If the Face on Mars was created by unknown life forms, NASA would have no reason to hide it. Many conspiracy theorists state that NASA is hiding the truth from us. They believe that the Face on Mars is key evidence for life on Mars, but if that was true NASA wouldn't hide it.

if they found life on Mars, NASA could get much more funding for their research. They would make millions of dollars out of it. If they had found spmething that intriguing, they wouldn't even think of keeping it a secret.

Many believe that maybe it was just a bad picture and thatthere could be hidden alien markings, but there were many diferent pictures taken. NASA was able to take several photos at many different times, so there would be no way that they missed something. NASA has new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry that shows that the Face on Mars is just a simple mesa.

The Face on Mars is just a natural occurance. NASA has done thier research and has concluded that this is just a simple mesa. Some people are still not satisfied with NASA's results. Do you believe its just a natural landform, or do you think there's something more to this situation?
