Everyone wants to make the best decisions for themselves. Asking advice and seeking for multiple opions can help make the best choice for you. If you talk to others they can help make the best choice for you. Seeking for multiple opions can help you better understand the topic and it can help make a opion of your own. Sometimes you may be unsure about your topic but there are ways you can better understand.

If you are unsure about your opion asking others can help. Say you are in history class and you are doing a debait and you dont understand the topic so well. You can talk to others and see their prospective on the topic. After you hear there own prospective you can start to make an opion of your own. Whenever i make a decision i always ask for other people opions about the topic so i can better understand what the pros and cons are and make the best decision for me. If you dont ask for others for advice sometimes your choice wont be the best for you.

You may have your own opion on a topic. But if you listen to other peoples opions on the topic they might change your prospective because you may have never thought about it in that way. An example for me is, i was writing a paper about if basketball players deserve how much money they make. My first opion was yes but after i was finished talking to others about the topic my opion changed. Another example is maybe you are having a hard time in a friendship and you need advice on what to do talking to others can help you make the right decision for you.

In conclusion seeking multiple opions can benefit you. It can help you make the best decisions for yourself. They can help you better understand your topic and it can help makeÂ an opion of your own. If you ever need advice asking others is the best way to go!
