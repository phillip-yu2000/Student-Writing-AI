When it comes to deciding wheather or not driverless cars should be used is up to everybody's own opinion. It is a pretty nice idea thoguh, having cars tat can drive for you while you also payattention is a fantasic idea. For example, take from paragragh 2, on how we have been fasintated by driverless cars. There have been at least more then twenty or so movies that have that idea, look at the movie called "I Robot". The cars can actually drive itself, but when it can't do that or when the drive wants to drive it shuts off with a smooth transition from one to the other. In addition, having a car that can drive itself but also have the sensors that need a human touch is a great idea, it makes sure that the driver it paying full attention, but also gives the driver some lee-way room when on the road. In addition, it is great that some cars like the BMW's can drive up to 25 mph when the car is in a area where there could be road work or traffic jams.

But in contrast, paragragh 9 made perfect a statement when saying/asking who will be at fault if the car crashes. If the car has a technology problem, does that mean the manufacurer is to blame or if the car is switching to person driving and it glitches out who is to blame then. In addition, when driverless car start to make advances in the world, does that mean we will no longer need to get driver licences, no longer need to have back ground knowledge on how the roads work and how to operate them if the cars system doesn't work. Will we no longer need to have any background on how to drive and how to operate them. In consculsion, it is a great advancement in are socitiy today, to have driverless cars, but down in the long run it make not ne the advancement that everybody will want to have for the future gernerations to come.
