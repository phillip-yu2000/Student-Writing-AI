Principal,

I honestly think that if your reconsidering the school's cell phone policy, then go with policy 1. I, think that it would be beneficial for both the students and the adults if you went with policy 1. If you let the students have their phones out during lunch and free time it would be beneficial in many ways.

For one, if you decided to go with policy 2, you would most likely find a lot of students getting caught with cell phones. Taking away the cell phone privilege from students is bad and good in a way. Its bad because students wouldn't be able to communicate with their parents very well, so they would end up trying to hide it from the teacher, and getting caught in class and during passing time. It would be good because teachers would spend less time taking phones away, but actually teaching the class instead.

Students do need phone time. Their parents might be trying to get a hold of them for an emergency, so if no phones are aloud, the student would never be able to return that call or text. If phones were aloud, that student would be able to communicate and return that missed call to that parents emergency or needs.

Having a no cell phone at all policy would lead to many phones getting taken away and many other problems involving a phone. If I were the principal, I would go with policy 1. Policy 1 lets both the students and the teachers get their ways. Students would get time for their cell phones, and teachers would most likely find less cell phones going off in students pockets. The teacher also would get more time to actually teach the class, and actually have the students attention.

Sincerely,

Your Student
