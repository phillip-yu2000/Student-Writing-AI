Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Community service is a outstanding activity to do .During community service you helps others and in some situation the environment. I believe it also help the development and growth of a young adult. Sometimes i believe that when the students hear community service they think of exhausting hard work. Yet if we tell the students that community service can be doing the simplest thing. I'm sure they couldn't deny it.

So community service is an awesome experience for anyone.

Community service can be a simple as picking up waste that you have seen just lying on the ground. Community service can also be u taking care of younger children at a day care center. So some community service can be fun, you just have to adventure out and give it a chance. Like with me and my friends say we see a plastic bottle or can well pick it up, search for nearest trash can and play a game of basketball. So we should at least have students try some community service first then see if the like it or not.

Community service also isn't a solo job. You can do community service with a groupof.

Your friends u all can go around picking up trash and throwing it away. Also the community service you do can help others and yourself. like how u pick up trash thrown in your yard do the same elsewhere.

So I do believe community service should be done with the students in our school. It is a good dead and should be done.

Students may not like it at first but after a while they will get used to it. Community service will do our students good it will also do the community well

Sicerly, STUDENT_NAME
