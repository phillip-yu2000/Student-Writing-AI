A Seagoing Cowboy is someone who helped take animals to the countries that were devestated by World War ll.

I, Luke Bomberger, am a Seagoing Cowboy.

I not only got to help others who were in need, but I also got to expirience the sights and hisoric landmarks in other countries.

I highly encourage you to join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and be a Seagoing Cowboy.

Think of how sad you would be if you were devestated by the war and had barely anything left.

Wouldn't you want someone to help bring you supplies such as animals?

Well you can be one of the few people to contibute.

The families over seas are all very kind and appriciative.

Though they are still very much in need.

So, you would just be helping the cause by joining.

Over the past year, me and my friend, Don Reist, have had the opportunity to see historical landmarks.

The chance to just see Europe and China would have been special.

But Don and I got to expirience so much more than that.

We got to see the Acropolis in Greece.

Also, taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, was a treat.

I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Come on.

Don't tell me you wouldn't love to have the opportunity to see the Panama Canal!

All you have to do is join the Seagoing Cowboys.

As you can clearly tell, being a Seagoing Cowboy is truly a great expirience.

We get to help those in need, and also have the chance to see historic landmarks around the world.

I hope that soon, you will decide to be like Don and I and join the UNRRA and become a Seagoing Cowboy.
