I think that driverless cars are a great idea. Driverless cars would prevents many wrecks and accidnets do to unskilled or careless drivers. They would also make traveling more effecient and fun. The advancement of driverless farm equiptment already exists and is very useful and efficeint for big time farmers. They can plant and plow fields throught the use of GPS and an automated oporating system. Driverless cars could be used the same way, but instead of planting a field they would take you to your friends house. With driverless you wouldn't have to worry about directions, all you would have to do is put in your destination and the cars would find the quickest route by itself. You wouldn't have to worry about being distracted because the car dives itself. The only time when you would need to be paying attention is when there was hazards or construction areas.

In the future I think everyone will have self driven cars and driving will only be as useful as reading a book: you need to know how to do it, but there is no need to. This future is getting closer and closer every day. I think that in ten years these cars will be cheap enough that people will consider buying them instead of a normal car. I think that the roads will be much safer and more fun. I think that in 20 years everyone will have them and driving will be a thing of the past.
