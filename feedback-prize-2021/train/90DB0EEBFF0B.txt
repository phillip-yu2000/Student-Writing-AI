Have you ever been forced to do something you don't want to do? It's not always fun when you are required to participate in something you don't like.

Well my principle thinks that all students must participate in some type of activity or sport during school. I have a few opinions on that. First of all there are different types of people. Not everyone likes to participate in sports or activities. Theres also people that aren't veryÂ social so, participating in anything might not be there thing. Then theres some that are just lazy. On the other side their are people that like to participate and be social with people. Theres actually interested in sports or school activities. But sometimes poeple just want to talk with their friends. I think it should't be required to participate in school activities. You should be able to choose what you want to do. Like if you don't participate you should just be able to hangout with your friends while, others can play sports or participate in activities. If some poeple choose to do sports or be in any sort of activity thats great for them.

These are my reasons why, I disagree if my principle required us to participate in any school activity. You should never be forced to do anything.
