Dear Principle,

Community service should be recommended for all students. It helps them learn about the community that they live in and to help it run smoothly. Like picking up litter would help the earth by saving it from all the waste that humans just throw out. It'll also help animals from dieing because sometimes the stuff humans just throw out can hurt animals and sometimes kill them.

Other kinds of community service is good to. Like giving food to the people that starve and don't have any money to feed there family or give toys to needy children who don't have anything. Doing stuff like that is good to do because it helps other people around them and it also makes the person that does it feel good about themselves.

I highly recommend that all students to contribute in community service whether its picking up litter, doing food drives, donations, tutoring or anything that can help out the community. I assure you its not a waste of time.

Thank you,
