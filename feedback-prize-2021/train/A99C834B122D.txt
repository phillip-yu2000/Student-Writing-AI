Advice is like a type of candy some it could be good it could be bad. some people look for advice from others to make decisions they could not make themselves. The reason for this is because some people do not have a good outlook on things so they look for others that can give them the right advice.

Also; getting advice puts less pressure on a person for they do not have to think as much.Â I for one believe that getting advice is helpful especially since there is so much to give. A person could get advice from anyone about anything and its helpful because so many others are looking for the same thing.

Furthermore; with the help of advice a person could make the right decision. They can give you the right choice to make during a desperate time of need in which you can make the most out of it . with being stated I believe should seek for multiple opinions on topics for it adds variety, creativity, and builds social skills.
