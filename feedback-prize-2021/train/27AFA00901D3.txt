The world that we know is changing so extremely fast. Technology is making everything easier and more mobile. The biggest change it has made is in education. Many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will focus much better and can move at their own pace; however, students would lack basic social skills.

To begin, students taking classes from home will have better focus. Students get distracted and off topic very easy due to the large setting of people. For example, I struggle with getting work done because I get very distracted if there are off topic conversations in the classroom. Many students have this same struggle which could be avoided by taking classes from home.

Next, students can move at their own pace when taking classes from home. People are all different and learn different and at different paces. For example, I learn slower than others in math subjects, but I learn slightly faster than others in science subjects. Many people would benefit from taking classes from home soÂ they can work and learn at the pace that fits them.

On the other hand, students would lack basic social skills if they take classes from home. People usually meet all of their friends, best friends, and associates throughout school. For example, I met my best friend in school in the fifth grade. We have been friends since, and if I had never went to public school I would have never met her. Schooling that is not from home teaches people the basic skills they need to create friendships and build relationships.

To conclude, many students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students will focus much better and can move at their own pace; however, students would lack basic social skills. This has been made possible thanks to the rapid change technology is making on our world.
