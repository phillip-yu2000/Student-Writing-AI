Seagoing Cowboys program, is an opportunity of a lifetime. After World War II was over many countries were left in ruins. So the UNRRA made a program to help these contries called the ¨ Seagoing Cowboys ". We take care of animals that will be shipped overseas. Also helping people by giving food and also seeing Europe, China, and Acropolis in Greece. You can also find time to have fun on board playing a veritiy of games after unloading the animals.

In the text it states, ¨ It was 1945 , World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. UNRRA hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.¨

Text also stated that, ¨ Besides helpling people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.¨

Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program allows you to experience adventures and visit many unique places. But being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure, it can open up a new world for you. Its a grateful opportunity to take. It can make you more aware of people of other countries and their needs. So sign up today, from a fellow Seagoing Cowboy, Luke Bomberger.
