Phones have become a huge addiction in people's life. For some people the thought of not having their phone on them kills them. Today, the majority of the population operate a cell phone on the daily basis. What's your opinion on whether or not a driver should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Well my opinion is that I think drivers should not be able to u cell phones while driving.

My first reason on why I think that drivers shouldn't be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because it could cause a major distraction. Having a distraction while driving can cause any bad things to happen. Cell phone distractions have led to car crashes which has led to death and serious injuries. There are hand-held cellphone use ban in about 20 states. All cell phone ban in 21 states and text messaging ban in 48 states. Each year over 330,000 accidents have been caused by cell phones.

Using a cellphone while driving puts life's at risk. Not only does it put your life at risk but also the people surrounding you. You and the passengers in the vehicle could get injured or could even die. Also the drivers and passengers around you. " While using a phone is the most common form, distracted driving is anything that diverts a driver's attention from the road, even something as simple as changing the radio station." Is an opinion from www. thecrcconnction. com . Some people go out and think they will come back fine but sometimes things can happen on the road.

Using phones while driving will always be a huge distraction even if some people deny it. Deaths and injuries have happened to kids, teenagers, adults, etc. This is why phones shouldn't be used while driving to prevent these types of things from happening. Even though there are laws that have been made to prevent these things people still ignore them.
