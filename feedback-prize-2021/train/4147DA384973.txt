Being able to go on Venus would be great thing but we can not do that. This author explains how it might be done. Do you ever wonder if there is a planet out there just like earth? Venus could be that planet, the only problem is we cannot land on it. In paragraph 2 the author states " offten refered to as Earth's twin, Venus is the clostest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionaly the closest in distance."those are some facts about Venus and Earth. in paragraph two it also states " humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world . Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survided the landing for more than a few hours." The author explains how they have tried sending spacecrafts up too venus but have not worked very good. The author goes on very well too expalin how it would be very hard and how it would be bery hot and hard conditions too land there.

The author brings up something from nasa that could work and he agrees on, in paragraph 5 it states " The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particulary compelling idea for semdimg humans to study Venus. NASAÂ’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. How this paragraph makes the author better is because he is researching it and comparing it too his idea. This idea would not be easy buy if it can work there is a chance we can still study venus and one day have humans land on it.
