Dear Principal,

I think the new policy is unfair to us. Some students like sports and now can't play them because of this new rule. Students on the school's sports teams might not get to play now because their grade average is lower than a B.

One reason that I stated in the paragraph above is that some students like sports. Students that play sports stay active and fit. They remain healthy and happy. The new rule takes that away from the students.

The other reason I wrote was that school sports teams may lose good players because they have C average grades. We wouldn't get any new students or a good reputation. Those students that were kicked out of sports could have made the school better.

On the other hand, I see why you made this new rule. One reason is because it's not fair to the A average students to have worked so hard for their grades, those students deserve to play sports with students of the same grade level. Another way that the rule seemed necessary is because students that don't try to do good shouldn't have the privilege to play in sports or other after-school activities.

In conclusion, these students work hard at sports and don't want all that practicing to go to waste. This new rule isn't right because it's not fair to the students. Students that like sports or are in school sports will get angry because they won't get to do what they love.

Sincerely,
