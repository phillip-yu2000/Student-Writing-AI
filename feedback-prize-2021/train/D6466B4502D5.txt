Dear Principal,

I believe we should have cell phones in school to use during are lunch period and are free time. In school we don't get to see everyone or talk to everybody. I think if we can have the first policy everybody will be better off. The more time we have we could study off of it when we have free time. If the teacher has some free time we could text her or call instead of going down to their room. It would be nice to have a conversation with people that you can't see because you have other friends that you hang out with.

I believe that if we have to many phones taken away that you should have them get shut off when we walk into class. The teacher will know that nobody is using it to get answers off a test or quiz we are taking. The more freedom you give us we will respect it by trying not to ruin it. The responsibility will become a more higher risk but we can handle it because we all know what is wrong or right.

The students in class talk to each other on the phone while the teacher is teaching important lessons. If this first policy happens they can learn more because they know in there free time they can talk to them. The more things we know the more better we will be in the future. I like to pay attention in class but i distracts me when we have to look at someone to tell them to stop.

If you decide to pick policy one everyone will be happy and things will go a lot better at this school. There will be no more texting in class and trying to call people when the teachers aren't around. If we need are parents because something has gone wrong or they need us because something happened we would know. I hope you consider policy one over two.

Your Student
