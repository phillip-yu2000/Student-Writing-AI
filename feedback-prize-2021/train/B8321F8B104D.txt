Would you want help from one person are multiple people? I would want more help not less. People ask for advice from multiple people because the people they are asking may of had the problem before and know what to do and they don't know it, and different people give different advice for the same thing.

Choose between a person how had the same experience as you or 10 people that has not which one would you ask for advice. People how have the same problem are most likely going to give you good advice because they know the trouble of the situation and how to get out of it. Not everyone is going though the same problems as you so trust their advice not everyone else. If they know what to do then do it.

Advice is weird someone says some to help you and the someones says the opposite. If no one knows what you are going thoughÂ then trust the words of the many but only then. it is good to take in all the advice in like a sponge but release the unhelpful one like things you already know are not going to work.

The more advice you have the more changes that are helpful. Many people don't know how to give good advice so ak more so ou can find people who do give good advice.

People who have good advice are out in the world so ask people don't just stand there and wait just ask. It is good to ask lots of people because the more helpful adivice he better. In conslusion it is good to ask multple people for advice you never know who is going to be helpful.
