I don't think that they should make the cars, because like they said in the article who's going to want to wait their turn? It would be different if the cars actually drove by themselfs through traffic, but they don't so I don't think they should be made. Some people like driving so the people making the cars would be taking away something that other people like to do. I don't think that it would be very safe, because what if the car got in to a crash and the car just kept going. I think that we should just stick to the cars we have to drive. This world doesn't need anymore technology. It's changing and it's not changing in a good way. People will become lazy and not want to drive anywhere. I just don't want this world to be lazy. The cars dont have to be that fancy if you have something to drive thats awsome, but we dont really need them to drive themself's. It's a stupid idea and I don't think that it should happen ever in life. Cars that drive themselfs are going to be very expensive and everybody's gonna want one, but some people can't have them because they dont have money like that. Somepeople would try to steal them or hurt people just to get one. I think that these cars are going to start alot more crime. So no, i dont think that the driverless cars should be made it's a bad idea. I just dont want this world to get any worse than it already is. That's why I think that driverless cars shouldn't be made.
