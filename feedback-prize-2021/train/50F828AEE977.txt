Dear Principal,

I am STUDENT_NAME a student of your who wants to protest against the b average policy. People should have at least have a c average to play sports not a b average to play sports. One reason i think it is bad to set it at a b average is what if the best player on the team has a c average and cant play because the principal made the grade change to a c average. We should actually get a vote on the b average policy because i believe we got a vote it would come out being a c average. Therefore, theses are a couple of reasons we should stick with a c average for a student principal.

I do get the side you are coming from to principal. I understand that you want to set a higher average on the students so they will try harder. What if some kids try there hardest and still cant get a b average and have a c average. I know you probably think that all the kids can to do it if they set there mind to it ,but the truth is that will never happen. Also if you set a c average it will take a little stress off the kids because if you set it to a b average they will do homework until there brain is fried. So i understand where your coming from.

So Principal i hope you take this letter and think about it. I am just telling you now if you set it to a b average for sports some of your best players are going to not be playing anymore. I hope you find in your heart that kids don't need stressed out all the time they need breaks from homework. So if you can change the average from a b to a c it would help out a lot of people including me. I hope u consider my letter and change the average from a b to a c for all of kids.
