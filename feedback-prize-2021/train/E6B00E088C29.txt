In the article the author greatly supports the idea of studying Venus and that it will be worthy despite the dangers. In paragraph 8 the author says that striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. Another example is that in paragragh 4 it says that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most-earth like planet in our solar system. There are also many dangers that come when visiting Venus and they are that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Something that is even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. One example is using old technology called mechanical computers. Human curiosity wil likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

It is probably good to at least try our best and give it all we got to achieve what we want.
