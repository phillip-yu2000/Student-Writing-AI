Dear principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i'm a student at this school. A lot of my friends take it hard to believe that picking up trash is good for the community and earth. They do not think they should waste there time with all of that stuff. They always litter and i tell them not to but they don't care.

I have other friends that love to clean up and make our community look good. They volunteer and rest homes and even at our school. I always see them recycle paper and cups. With out them our community would be a mess.

Yes i encourage all of our students to try there very best with picking up litter and recycling paper because its good for our planet. Our city would look very good with no trash on the ground. I no its not the fun nest thing to do but some one hast to do it. With all of our students working together it might not even take that long. So i will try to encourage everyone i see to pick up at least five peaces of paper a day because that would even make a difference.

So please go through with the plan you have and make a difference in our world and community and i will 100% back you up with everything if you need it. You have my time a devotion.

your student,

STUDENT_NAME
