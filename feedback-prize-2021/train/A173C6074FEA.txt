Dear Principal,

My opinion i believe that we the students should be able to have are phones at school. I think that they should be shut of during the classes , but however at lunch the students should be aloud to use them to call parents for emergency uses. The students have the right to bring there cell phones to school it is not hurting anybody. i could understand why you are considering making the policy so that we can not have are cell phones , in some cases you may think that it is interfering with our learning but most of the students will be responsible and keep there phone in there back packs turned off.

Most of the students have to walk to and from school and some live in bad parts of town so there parents have them when they call when they get to school or when they leave from school.

There are many other purposes why students need to have there cell phones at school, but these are just the ones that i felt were most important.

Thank You.
