Have you ever been driving a car and wish that the car would drive for you? I wish that almost every time I drive. Some manufacturers say that there will be driverless cars by the year 2020. I think driverless cars would be a very helpful aspect in life. Driverless cars would benefit not only drivers but the world around them in many ways.

Driverless cars have many benefits. If the car is driving for us, people would be able to text and drive without worrying about not watching the road. By people being able to text and drive without worry, less accidents will happen which could result in less deaths from automobile accidents each year. New or young drivers who are not as used to driving would feel safer with the car in charge and not themselves. They would be able to drive less worried and feel safer.

These car could potentionally help people with a disability that results in them not being able to drive. This could benefit them because the car would do the driving for them and they would be able to feel more independant and safer on the road. People with babies or young children in the car often get distracted by crying or temper tantrums or even the child wanting something while in the car. If the car drives for them they can tend to the child without worrying about not paying attention to the road and putting the child, theirs and other peoples lives in danger.

Driverless cars would benefit not only drivers but the world around them in many ways. These cars would be a major advance in technology. They would benefit everyone and not just a certain group of people. These cars could help reduce the amount of accidents each year and reduce the amount of deaths from cars. People would feel safer on the roads. Driverless cars are a good aspect to our lives.
