I don't think completely driverless cars are a good idea at all, for many different reasons. The price on those cars would be an outrageous amount that only rich people would be able to afford. A driverless car is also just another way for people to be lazy, someone is always trying to invent something just so people can do less work and I think that's honestly really stupid. I don't think it would be very fun to have a driverless car anyways, all you would do is sit in a car until you get where your going. In my opinion it's more fun to drive at your own speed and physically on your own. It's like everyone wants the world to run on robots! What fun is that though? I don't see why anybody would want to depend on a robot to do literally everything for them, thats just no fun. Besides right after they make these driverless cars they're going to be on to the next invention trying to make something even better than the last, along the way making the world an even lazier place.
