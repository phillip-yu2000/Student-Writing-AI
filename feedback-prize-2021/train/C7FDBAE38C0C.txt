Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because their brain wouldn't be functioning as well as it would be in public school. Students wouldn't be as focused at home than they are at school. I feel like students wouldn't be able to benefit from taking classes at home because there could be distractions at home that can prevent them from learning, students can't ask for help when needed, and it would make students feel like they can do whatever they want, when they want.

Students would not benefit from online classes because there could be distractions at home that can prevent them from learning. For example, I'm trying to complete an assignment for an online class, but my younger siblings keep crying and distracting me from doing so. Also, other distractions include: phones, family, and pets that can possibly prevent me from doing my work. For example, I have a project that's due the next day, but my dog barks to get my attention and causes me to lose focus.

Students would not benefit from taking online classes because they can't ask for help at home. For example, if I need help on an assignment, I'm most likely not going to get help because I have to contact my teacher and wait for a response from them. Meanwhile, in public school, I can easily get help from the teacher by raising my hand, instead of waiting thirty minutes for a response online. There are some difficult tasks in school, and when you have a certain question on something, you might not get an immediate response from your teacher, especially online.

Students would not benefit from taking online classes because at home, students feel as if they can do whatever they want, when they want. For example, when taking classes online, students can eat, sleep or use their phones because they think that online classes mean that they can do it whenever they please. When students eat while doing their work, the food makes them tired and their brain slowly shuts down. Students can't face consequences from behind a screen, but in public school, you would be forced to face consequences if you didn't comply with the rules. For example, students that take online classes can use their phone whenever they choose, but in public school, if you were caught using your phone, it would be confiscated by an administrator.

Overall, students would not benefit from taking classes online because their brain isn't functioning well just by receiving information from a screen. Public schools can make you take in the information given, and I feel like students learn better by having the teacher speak about the subject instead of a computer displaying it. When a teacher is speaking on the subject, they're going into detail. Meanwhile, online classes just display loads of information on the screen that might not be useful.Â
