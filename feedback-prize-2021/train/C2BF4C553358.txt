The principal shouldn't change the school policy in the middle of they school year because if some of the players on the team might have C averages it wouldn't be fair to them to just quit the team because they have a C average, they might have too much work to do after sports and are tired and rush through the work just to get it done. Many students would be angry because they would think they would have to quit right away because they have a C average and have no time to get the work done, after a while they should be able to get the work done for school so they can play sports. The other problem with changing that policy is that a C is better than a D and it shows that they try to keep up good grades but a B would be better people who play sports and have a B average that's good and people who have a C average should at least try to bring their grade up to a B average. The principal should talk with the students before anything and try to get them to get there grades up before changing that policy also the principal should wait for the next school year to make any changes because its not right for the students who love sports and for the school because it could be the year they go to a championship game and bring back a trophy for the schools trophy case. Many students have a C average it's not right to make that change because they mighty have trouble at home doing homework or reading, is their a reason why the principal wants to make a change in the school policy if their is no reason she wants to change the school policy then she shouldn't change it.
