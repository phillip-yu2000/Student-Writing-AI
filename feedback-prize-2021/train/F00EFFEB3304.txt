I like the idea of driverless cars but I dont think its something we should bring into the world. It isnt one hundered percent safe and I feel it would be to expensive.

First off, safety. Safety is probobly one of my main concerns. We all know that electronic devises bug out all the time. Lets say you have a very important meeting and your alarm on your phone doesnt go off. What does that cost you? Maybe your job or punisment for missing that meeting. Now imagion that instead of you phone its your car. Now instead of your job your life.

Secondly, money. Are economy isnt the best. So where would we get all this money for something that isnt completely nessasary. The writer states that not only would it take money for the sensors and the cars but also road. These "Smart Road" would need to be installed before any cars are even released. That takes time and money we dont have.

Is this really a good idea? The passage says, "Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves." I was aware that you arnt suppost to do things you see on t. v. Is this really what America is developing in its free time? We could be improving society. Cancer is something we have been working on for years and now there going to put time and money into something that we dont need.

What is the price range of these new cars? Will these new "Smartcars" be the same as a regular car? When they format the road will regular cars not use the roads? Will the poor and middle class be able to even drive if they cant affored a new Smartcar? These are questions that need anwsers if this idea will ever come into affect.

This is my take on these "Smartcars". It sounds like a good idea but is raises to many questions and doesnt answer enough. All of these reasons are why I think Smartcars should stay in the movies.
