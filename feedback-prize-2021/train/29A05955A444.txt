Dear principal

I think that would be a good idea but at the same time it would be a bad one. The reason why i think it would be a good idea is because if people wanted to do sports and they had a C or lower, they would work on getting their grade up and they would learn more things if they payed more attention and they got their work in. I think it would help the students too because if they just kept failing every class they wouldn't have as good education as if they did pay attention and they would have a better life because it would help them in life. Another thing why i think it's a good idea is because people would get used to getting as B or higher and they would probably keep it that way.

Why i think it would be a bad idea is because what if people really liked the sport but they couldn't play in it because their grade was around a C and it was hard to get it up and then people couldn't join the team so they didn't get to play. There wouldn't be very much people on the team as if it was a C or higher. Another reason why i think it is a bad idea is because students wouldn't want to join a sport anymore if it was a B or higher and the students would start getting lazy and their wouldn't be as much athletic people as before. I think more people would rather just have it as a C instead because they would be able to get the C instead of the B because it would be harder for them to get the B and keep it that way.
