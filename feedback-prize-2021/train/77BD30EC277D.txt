Dear Principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I think in order to help people in community service we should take the time to help people that are in need of help. This would be a great thing to do because it would be helping people. Helping people is a awesome way in showing how much people care about other people.

For an example; if we were to be require to take community service at school, some students would be need of help in math, language arts, science, social studies or anything that a student would need help in and would be able to receive help. This would make our learning increase and more student would be going to college. Parents, teachers, and even students want the best for themselves and with a help that each student could get it would make students comprehend and understand what the concept or subject they are working with. It will also make teaching easier.

Having community service will make students want to be focused in doing good things such as helping students or people and doing things that won't lead them to bad things. Community service will also help the community in having good and safe home and nice people around them. That's why i believe the principle should require community service to each student.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
