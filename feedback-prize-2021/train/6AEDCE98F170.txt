I disagree a little bit that there's gonna be driverless cars in future. I know that there will be more electric cars to preserve more gas.

There are advantages with driverless cars. There will probably be less accidents, have less careless drivers out in the streets. It'll have sensors to where if someone backs up to something to close the car will automatically hit the brakes. Driverless cars will probably have a better and engine and suspension system. But i just dont think that driverless cars are gonna do the trick because what if the car breaks down out of nowhere and you cant start it back up or what if you have to drive manually and the steering wheel doesn't work? What are you going to do? I would prefer more on electric cars than driverless cars because you wouldn't have no worries about gas money or anything like that.

But I would probably go more towards elcetric cars to save gas because driverless cars you would still need gas money .
