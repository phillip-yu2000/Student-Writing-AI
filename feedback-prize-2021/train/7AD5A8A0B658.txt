The author supports his idea really well. As he explains his idea he goes further in detail as to why Venus is a worthy pursuit even though there are many dangers that it presents. He goes further into detail by using things he researched out about Venus. In the 4th paragraph in the text it says, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system." This shows that it would be worth it to see in person. It also says, " Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth." If we were to go to Venus we could prove if that is true or not. Even though the author states reasons why it is a worthy pursuit there are still dangers to it. Such as temperatures and what a thick atmosphere it has. In the third paragraph it states, " a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. " If we were to inhale that much carbon dioxide we wouldn't be able to breathe well.

It also states that on the planet the averaging temperatures can go up to 800 degrees farenheit and that the pressure on the atmosphere is up to 90 times greater than what we expericence. We as humans wouldn't be able to handle going to Venus because we're not sutiable for that type of environment.
