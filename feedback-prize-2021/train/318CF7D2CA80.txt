First of all, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers for many reasons, the first reason will be because they are not sure what can they find there so they need to be very prepared for any visual or physical contact in Venus. another reason will be because it's close to the sun, so that means a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Also in paragraph 2 says "each previous mission was unmmaned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

In the paragraph 3 it says many reasons of why it is dangerous to go to study Venus more closer, it is dangerous to study Venus even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Our sister planet is so inhospitable; Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.

In conclusion, its important to know the risk are you gone to made cause of your actions, this information is a clearly example of cause and effect; the plans can be finished good or bad.
