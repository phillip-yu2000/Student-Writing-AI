Think,what would you purfur a car you drive yourself or one where you just sit back and watch it drive itself? In all hobnestly I purfer to have a car I can drive myself, so therefore I'm a hundred perecent against driveless cars. Driveless cars are not as goos as they maqke them out to be and I am here to say why.

If you can not drve the car yourself,then what's the point of having the drivers lisences you worked so hard to get? Think about if you no longer having a car you drive on your own your lisence will no longer mean nothig,but a card with your picture and your life information on it. Therefore you will intend to forget it at home and what if something does happen and you do not have your lisence on you then the wreck or whatever happned will be no longer pointing out to be the cars fault it all of sudden is yours because you do not have the lisence you thought you did not need, because you thought your driveless car could handle driving.

What if you're just driving down the road and the technology to the car stops working? think the technology stops working and you have no idea how to run the car so you're stuck in trafic you have no where to. SO you have to call atow truck and a cab so there's money you have to spend because they said drivles cars were better.

just sit and think deeper about having a drivless car than what they are making you think about. It all will start to get top you. All the flaws of havinga drivless car wil come to your mind.
