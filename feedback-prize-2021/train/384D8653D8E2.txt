Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I hear that you are debating on making the students in our school do some kind of community service. There are benefits and drawbacks to that plan. Let's start with the drawbacks, or disadvantages.

First of all, many kids don't want to take time out of their day to help the community. Even if it's something as small as just taking out the trash. Kids these days are extremely lazy. But, it all depends on the task, and the person. Also, some parents don't support their kids in doing after school activities. If a student had a difficult service, some parents wouldn't let their child achieve that goal weather it may be the student not having transportation, they may not have certain materials they need for that task, plus many more reasons. But with every disadvantage comes an advantage.

There are many advantages when it comes to assigning a task that will help the environment. First of all, if the student actually does the assignment, then it will help the environment. Even if it is just one little thing. Many little things can lead to one great thing. And every now and then, you will find some students that will go out of their way to help change our declining environment. And those students usually have parents that will support them with the supplies and transportation the students desire.

I personally think that the environmental project would be a great way to help our environment. And it would be a great way to boost up my grades! But if you do decide to make the project go in effect, then i would appreciate if we could work in a group of two or three classmates. Like i said, I'm all for the project because i know my parents, and if i worked in a group, their parents, would support us, the future of this nation we call home, in participating in this great move to help change the future of this planet.

Your student,
