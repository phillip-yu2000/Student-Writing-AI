Dear TEACHER_NAME,

It has came to me that students are wanting to bring their cell phones to school and using them in school. In my opinion, I respectively agree with those students. I believe that Policy #1, "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time," should be enforced in our school for many reasons.

First of all, I believe that students should have access to their cell phones during lunch periods and free times in case of an emergency, the students can contact their parents or whoever they need to talk with. If the students were to need something from their home or some other place, they can call their parents ask them to come drop it off at school.

Secondly, all students in our school should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free periods because it is the students' free time to decide what they would like to do during that time, and if the student decides to use their cell phones to call or text people, than that should be perfectly fine. There is no harm in using cell phones, and if there were, then the students wouldn't even have cell phones in the first place. If the students are allowed to talk to each other during lunch and other free periods, then why can't they use their cell phones to communicate with each other?

Last but not least, having cell phones in school during lunchtime and other free periods will not get in the way of their studies, because all cell phones need to be turned off during class time. There would be no distractions during class because there will be no cell phone to be distracted from. So if the students' focus in class is a worry, then it shouldn't be, because they would only be allowed to have their cell phones turned on during lunchtime and other free periods.

I respectfully hope that you will consider my opinion on the Cell phone policy.

Sincerely,

Your Student
