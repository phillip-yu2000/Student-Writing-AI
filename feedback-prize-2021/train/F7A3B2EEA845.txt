Many of you people who believe in the paranormal think NASA is trying to hide that there is life on Mars. You can put your doubts to rest bacause there is multiple evidence that "The Face of Mars" is NOT an alien formation.

As shown in many photos of the face there are unusual shadows in this formation that do seem to appear to be a face. But there are also many formations on Earth that take the shape of faces and everyday things. "What pictures actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West" says Garvan, who is the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.

Acording to Gavan when they first took the pictures of the face they were very surprised by this discovery, but later dicovered "...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." "it was just another Martian mesa, commom enough around Cyndonia." Cyndonia is an area or Mars. So, once again it has been scientifically proven that there is no alien monument or formation.

There are many pictures, blurry pictures and well taken pictures, of the The Face of Mars that show that there is no alien monument. The formation is just your every day mesa that just so happens to look like a face.
