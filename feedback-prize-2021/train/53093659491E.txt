Dear Principal,

I think all of the students should be required to perform a community service project because it prepares students for a career, it helps them learn that making peoples lives easier can benefit them, and it teaches them to take after themselves.

Don't you just think it's annoying to not have much kids do the community service project just because they don't want to? All of the students, including myself should be required to do the community service project. My main reason for this would be that it prepares them for a career when they get older. A job has almost no difference between it and community service, the only difference is that a job you get paid to do. So if they do the project, why not give that person a reward? Every hour that they work with proof of doing so, he or she should get 5-10 pieces of candy every hour they work on the project, thus making the project like a career. And instead of only once a year, make this project more like a career by making the project a regular thing that you have to do every 2-4 weeks.

Also, this project might help them learn that if you make other peoples lives easier you can get benefits of helping. A student could get regular working hours on raking their neighbors yard for instance. If a student chooses to help someone they know it could build up a friendship with that person, they could start making money when they aren't doing the community service project. For example working at your dad's work scrubbing bathroom floors could earn you the respect of the people there and you get rewarded for your efforts.

Lastly, this project helps kids to do this kind of thing on their own. At your house your mom and dad make you do your chores when you get home from school, right? I think the community service project promotes the idea of doing these things without your parents asking you to do them. Also, it can motivate kids to get up and do their morning chores without the parent ever waking them up.
