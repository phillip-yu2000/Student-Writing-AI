Some think that the Face on Mars was made my aliens. Some think that its a natural landform. Some even think that the similar earth landforms were formed by aliens.

I believe that the Face is a natural landform. The large landform on Mars is very similar and naturally made like landforms on earth and even more specifically the American West. A very good example of this is the Middle Butte in the Snack River Plain of Idaho.

The landforms such as the Middle Butte in the Snack River Plain of Idaho are made from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Knowing how the formation in Idaho is formed increases the evidence showing how easy it would be for Mars to have a similar landform. it is very well a natural landform, just on a different planet. Mars is such a similar planet to earth that the lantural landforms could be, and in this case are, very similar.

No matter what you believe, rather it is a natural formation or made by an ancient life form or aliens, all the evidence and proof points to, and proves, that the Face on Mars is in fact, just a natural landform that is most likely an equivalent of a bette or mesa.
