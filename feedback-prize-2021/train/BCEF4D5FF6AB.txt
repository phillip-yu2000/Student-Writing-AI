This policy change will be a bad idea because a c average is good.

B average is better but many school will not have a lot of kids playing sport.

a c average is not the best but it will get you in to high school. a lot of kids my even move from to school and go to a school that c averages can play sports. its not going to be fair to a lot of kids not saying it will be better in a way. it may be a good idea if the school is doing bad like kid are getting d and F 's. it may improve kids in there work so they will get a and B 's it will be for the best. i been to a school that the kids talk back to the teacher and the throw stuff at the teacher and the school say if you have a c average you are off sports. the kids got way better a lot of the bad kids transferred to a new school and the good kids stayed so they swiched back to c average. i when to a good school last time it was the best you can get in with a d average. than the school got bad cause the kid from a different school came and they did so bad that they swiched it to a A average to play sport. the kids did not care so they just got rid of to sports i think a c average is the best for the school so everything can be equal. a,b,c,d,f. c is in the middle a B has 3 in back and one in front it will be the biggest mistake to do this. that is my reson
