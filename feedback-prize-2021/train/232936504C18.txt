Dear Principal,

That policy is a horrible idea. It doesn't matter what the students average is maybe there staying for extra help or to join extra curricular activities. The students need a fun program to really care about there grades. If you do this our whole school will be nerd's and geeks. We need stupid people to keep this school going. Without them, where would we be? The nerd's wouldn't have anyone to work for them. Albert Einstein was a dropout and failed 3 grades. And he was the smartest man ever! Lets be honest, without stupid people, or average people where would this world be. There would be no-one to cook your hamburger or take your order or be sports stars or skateboard in front of a camera. All this world would be is pocket protectors and calculator's! No Monday night football, well there might be soccer, but that's for girls anyway.

In my perspective and I'm sure mostly everyone at our school, you need to take this policy out of commission. No one likes this policy, but you and probably the school board.

sincerely,
