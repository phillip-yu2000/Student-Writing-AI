Dear Principal,

I believe all students should do community service.

It helps the community out, community service can range from different thinks like helping people, cleaning up things, or planing things.

If students volunteer to pick up trash it could make a good impression on people who are visiting or riding through.

People would think we're a very neat and clean town.

Helping children in elementary school could give them the attention the teacher can't always give to them.

For students who don't want to do it because they got things to do, want to do, or just don't want to do it are just plain selfish.

They should have to stay after school, and do things for the school.

Helping the community is important, you're gradually making the place you live or a town a better place for people and animals to live.

That's why I think all students should be required to do community service.
