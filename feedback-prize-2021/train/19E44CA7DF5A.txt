Dear principal,

I think that it is fair for students who would like to join sports to have a grade B average. If students didn't have that rule then they could go around with f' s and still be in sports. The student wouldn't have to do any work and they would still be able to play. It's like rewarding a criminal for robbing a bank. This policy is a great idea it will help students to pay attention and get good grades if the would like to be in sports.

Some students who would like to join sports don't always have the best grades, but this rule inspires students to do their best to get their grades up to par.

For example my grades aren't the best, but i want to join track. I would have to raise up my grades and keep them that way to join the team.

This is the best policy the school could have for sports. It gives goals to kids who struggle with grades. This policy could help a school that has kids struggling in every subject momentum to raise up their grade.

For the students who have a grade C average they have the mind setting to raise up their grades. For the students who have a grade D average or lower it may be hard but it would be worth it if they love sports that much.

This policy is a great goal setter, and it would help students to climb that ladder and fix their grades.
