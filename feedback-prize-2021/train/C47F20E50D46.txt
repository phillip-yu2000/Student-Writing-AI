Home schooling has crossed the mind of every student at least once or twice within the twelve years of mandatory school they have to endure. The opportunity to receive an education from the comfort and familiarity of home. Giving students the opportunity to be able to attend classes from home via online would be beneficial to students with physical and/or mental disabilities and would also decrease the truancy rate.

Having a disability in itself is already a burden for some, whether it be physical or mental. Some disabilities make it hard to do everyday things like: waking up on time, speaking in public spaces, being in big crowds, and even in some cases getting an education. Being able to receive schooling in the comfort of your own home, or anywhere for that matter, would help rid the worry of children not getting the schooling they so rightfully deserve. Additionally, online classes would also lower the amount of bulling certain children receive because of their disability. Some kids are very cruel because of unknown reasons, and people shouldn't have to go through that just because they want to learn.

Another problem online school can help is truancy. Being that the class is online there is no excuse not to be able to do the work. Students don't have to show up to a certain place at a specific time or have to wake up super early, as long as some type of internet connection is available. Even though, there will always be some bad apples in the bunch that choose not to take advantage of being able to essentially 'work from home'; that shouldn't talk away the chance for the people would actually put in the effort to do the work.

In conclusion, students should be able to choose whether they want to go to a public school or participate in home/online school, because with being able to pick everyone has a chance to have something that accommodates to their individual needs.
