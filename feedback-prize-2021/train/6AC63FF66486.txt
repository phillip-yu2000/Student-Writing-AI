Dear Principal,

Not everyone has a B average why not making a C average because then kids in our school will be more active. So kids might not be getting B averages and then that means that not a lot of athletes would be involved in sports. If children don't have those kinds of grades there wont be much kids in activities so the school will be wasting money for activities that children aren't in. So if you waste money on the pointless activities the school wont be able to afford field trips or other activities. Yeah I know the teachers might want us to do better in school but it has to be fair we should at least be passing and a C average is still a passing grade. Come on you have to be fair with us or none of us will be in activities or sport groups. I know the teachers and you want us to do better in school but we are just asking for one thing. I hope you go with my decision because the school will be wasting money for groups or activities kids aren't in or don't have money for other things like field trips or dance.

Sincerely,
