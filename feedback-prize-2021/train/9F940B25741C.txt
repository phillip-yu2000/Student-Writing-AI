Dear Principal,

I believe that policy 1 is better because You should allow students to bring cell phone, and allow them to use it during our free times and during lunch. We can have them off during our class time, so it wouldn't be a distraction. We would use our time wisely for class and when we are done with our free time and/or lunch we would turn them off, and head straight to class. Another reason why students well say to allow cell phones so if something is wrong they can right away text there parents or if there is something wrong and the parents contact them, on our free time we can check our phone and respond to our parents.

If you allow students to have there phones out during free time that well probably stop us from having them out during class. Because when we already did what we wanted on our phone than students wouldn't want to use it again. Our phones would be useful for things like our phone can go on the internet and with our work in class we need research so we can do researching on our phone. When we have math problems we can use our calculator on the phone to help us with our math problem.
