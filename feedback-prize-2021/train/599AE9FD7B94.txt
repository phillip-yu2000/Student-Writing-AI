Dear, TEACHER_NAME

TEACHER_NAME i support you're policy 100 %. because kids need to learn that to be great in life and to have a great job, And to even get a job you need to get good grades and stay in school. I believe that if you go through with this policy they will start to think "well if i want to play football I'm going to have to get my grades up because i really want to play this year!" kids now are so focused on girls and sports and not on school and what they want to do after high school or in life. They need to learn that to get out of high you need to get good grades and stay in school because if u don't stay in school you want get a job. I think that this policy will help them understand that more.

I know that this policy will not only be good for the players that play sports but for the other kids to! the kids that don't play sports but hang around the kids that do. They will start to see that hey my friend is doing work and is doing really well maybe i should start do it to. This will make the athletes better leaders in school and on the field. So TEACHER_NAME take this in concentration i really think that it will work it might take a while for it to start rubbing off on everyone but it will get them thinking.
