Dear Principal:

I think that policy 2 is better for the students. I say policy 2 is better because when the students don't have their phones at school they are able to concentrate more on their school work and when students bring their phones to school it causes their grades to drop sometimes. They also shouldn't be aloud to have their phones because they come to school for a reason and they can wait to use their phones when they get home. Also when students have their phone at school they get distracted because when they have their phones they may keep checking it to see if someone text them and if a teacher is explaining something most students won't know what to do because they have their phones out.

I say policy 1 is not a good policy , because when students bring their phones to school and they have to be turned off most students are not going to turn them off because the teachers will not know if their phones are turned on or off. When students know they are aloud to bring their phones to school they are going to think they are aloud to use them all the time.

So i think you should choose policy 2 . I say that because that's the best policy for the students. if you want them to concentrate more on their school work more then they concentrate on their phone.

Sincerely:

STUDENT_NAME
