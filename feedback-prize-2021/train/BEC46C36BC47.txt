To the principal:

I understand that too many students, the argument of whether community service is a waste of time, or actually worth the while is much to debate. Whether or not we should be helping to plant the public gardens, or if watering those tulips is just a waste of time that could be spent doing other things. Well, I'm here too say that community service truly is important, and should definitely be required. It helps students of all ages, by getting into our community, by helping it out, and helping others out too.

One reason it should be required, is how much it helps our community! Now, I'm sure you know about the basics, like, how cleaning up litter makes a much more enjoyable walk, or how tutoring students helps them understand more. Well, how about doing things like, helping the new library open up? Wouldn't that help students understand the communities needs, help them too become more involved with the whole reading scene of the community, and hey, it might even help them too use their creative skills too get other's in there too.

Another reason community service is such an important part of the community, is of course, how it helps the community! Have you ever taken a walk in the park, and ooked around at all the trash laying everywhere, and just thought to yourself of how nice it would be without all that? Well, cleaning that up is a part of community service, so wouldn't it be great too have the students do that too make it much more enjoyable? It also gets them out there a little more.

Last, of the multiple reasons, is how it helps others. One other's see the students taking their part in helping the community, they'll want too also! Together we can make a much more enjoyable community, starting with the students.

So, out of all these reason, and more of course, why not have them in community service? It's great for everyone! Whether it be the community, other students, or skills,
