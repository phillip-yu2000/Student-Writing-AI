Now today I am going to disprove your statement that aliens created the Face seenon the red planet of Mars. The first thing that you have wrong is that the Face seen on Mars is of alien orgin. The Face that you see in the picture is just an oddly shaped Martian mesa. In fact there are very common on that region of Mars so for all we know there could very well be more oddly shaped mesas in that area.

The fact is that you miss read the caption of the picture or didn't even look at it at all. If you would've you should have seen the caption stating that the reason it resembles a human head is because of the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The only reason the let people see that photo is because they wanted more people to be intrested more in Mars.

Plus on April 5, 1998 NASA reaveled to everyone on their website the Face was mearly an oddly shapped Natural landform.

In conclusion there are several ways that we could disprove your statement. The first being that it is just a mesa which dosen't have a distinct form, which means that if another one forms it could very well be a dog or a cat. The second being that you may have just miss read or not have read the caption. Which clearly states that the reason the Face looks like that is because of the shadows and thats why it has a mouth, a nose, and eyes. Those are just two major reasons we know it's definetly a natural landform and not an alien made face.
