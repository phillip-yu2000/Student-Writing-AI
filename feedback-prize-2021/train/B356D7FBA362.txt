Dear TEACHER_NAME,

We the students of SCHOOL_NAME, would like to inform you that all students aren't able to make a "B". The reasons for that is that, if we fail a test or tests that can really drop our grade. And because by us being if sports will push up to keep our grade up in that sports, because that our desire and passion in what we like.

The first reason is because, if we have a test and we fail that drops us from a "B" to a "C" already. And when we stress over trying to get that low "C" up to a "B" makes it even worst. Because some of the class might be hard. I'm not saying that keeping a "A,B" average is hard or impossible but not for us to try to maintain for sports.

My other reason, is that by us being able to take part in school active is that, if we love a have a good feel for it then we will make sure that our grades are right. That we have nothing lower then a "C". Willing to do all our work, and will try hard to keep our grades up just to play in the game.

In conclusion, if you would let us be able to do a sport with a see. We promise you that we will do our best to get a "C" and high. Because by you not letting us play then we would just let our grade's drop. That being said because we don't have nothing to keep our grade up for in you won't let us do sport's with a "C".
