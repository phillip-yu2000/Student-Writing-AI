Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because different views can open your eyes to a problem. If you're having a fight with your friend, multiple opinions will help because you can see the argument from their point and try to understand what they are feeling. Multiple opinions can also help you make a strong decision based on if you agree or disagree with what the opinions say.

I was in a horrible argument with one of my friends. When we were fighting I searched for multiple opinions and it helped me make the right decision. After I talked to my mom and dad about what was happening they helped me realize that the girl was never a good friend to me and that I deserve a real friend.

Different views help with more than just arguments; they can help with forming your own opinion too. Last year I took civics class and I didn't fully have an opinion formed on politics. I started watching the news and political debates and I formed my own opinions on current issues. If I had only watched one news program or only listened to one person's campaign then I wouldn't have known that there was a different way to see things and I would have never formed a good opinion.

Whenever seeking advise you should always look for a variety opinions because someone could be wiser and already have lived through what you're going through. My mom has always been there for me whenever I need help and I hope that I can be there for her when she needs multiple opinions. She has always been very wise beyond her years and I love her for it because she helps me so much everyday.

Talking about problems with many people will help you learn multiple views on the matter at hand. It is important to remember your own opinion but also listen to others so you can form a wiser opinion. When making life changing decisions you have to remember to ask for help and truly listen to what they are saying because and outside voice could help you see the bigger picture.
