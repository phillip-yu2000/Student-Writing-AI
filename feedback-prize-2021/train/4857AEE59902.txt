In the article "the Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author states that astronomers are so facinated with venus and its harsh environment because it is the most like earth in our solar system. In fact most scienetists believe Venus was covered in oceans and had the ability to harbor life in it. Getting a better understanding of Venus could help progress space travel and the way astronauts land ships on planets and deal with climate and research.

The author says that Astronomers are facinated with Venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. The astronomers wan tot get a better understandimg of this planet as people may one day be able to set foot on it with enough research put in place. They need to understand the climate and the atmsphere before they can send any manned space shuttles there. The author said that unmanned space shuttles have been sent there before but havnt been sent in a long time because many of the shuttles would not manage to land in the harsh climate, and if they did they did not last long on the planets surface. Studying Venus maore would help astronomers understand how to better their space shuttles and make them work well, land, and last longer.
