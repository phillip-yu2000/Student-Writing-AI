Have you ever wanted to go somewhere without having to drive your car? I know i have, well Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and Sebastian Thrun founder of Google car project are trying to come up with a way to get cars to be faster and secure for us.

Today in our world of driving there are many people that don't care about the security of our kids and their ownselves. Many Adults and teenagers are always on their phones distracted from the road and putting theirself in danger. Especially teenagers, teenagers are the most irresponsible on the road today. A lot of teenagers like to go party and get drunk. Well unfortunately for us that is a big problem for drivers and parents. Teenagers drive drunk and text on their phones while driving. Well with Cars that dont need drivers, Teenagers will be safer more than ever instead of putting their life and someone else's in danger.

In Conclusion, if we have cars that don't need drivers, teenagers will be less likely to get in a car accident, and aldults including teenagers won't be on their phones because they're not driving. So if we had driverless cars today there would be less accidents, deaths, and we could also save money on gas.
