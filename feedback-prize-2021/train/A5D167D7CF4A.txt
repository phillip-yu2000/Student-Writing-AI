"Hold up, Someone's calling me. Uh huh. Okay. Sure. Really? No way! Hmmm. Okay, Bye! What were you saying?" I have heard this response too many times. It makes me feel that the person doesn't really care about what I'm going to say, like my input doesn't matter. I do not think cell phones should be included in an ideal learning environment.

Cell phones are a distraction. I've seen so many people slide out their cell phone and text or play a game while a teacher is talking. Not only is it affecting your grade,

but also is very rude. It is equivalent to asking someone a question and walking away while their talking. The teacher is there to help but the person simply ignores them. School is a place where you are supposed to engage and learn, not a place to play.

I've witnessed cheating before. I've seen someone walk out of the classroom texting answers to a friend. I've seen people use their cell phones to research test questions. Cell phones are for communicating. Unfortunately, people may misuse technology to cheat. Sometimes a student will whine to the teacher about having a cell phone stolen. That is one of the risks of bringing a phone to school.

Cell phones are great for communication. You could call your mom or dad or your aunt or uncle or anyone else. Maybe you need to go home earlier because a club was canceled. You could just whip out your phone and problem solved even if it is in sixth period History. This is the solution. Actually, the better scenario would be going to the office and calling from their phone. It is not that difficult. A walk up the stairs won't hurt.
