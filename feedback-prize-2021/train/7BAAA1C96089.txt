Why is that when someone ask for advise , they ask more than one person ? I feel as tho seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices what do you think ?

First , seeking opinions can impact lots of people , they can get tips on what they should do too solve the situation . Also getting advise can help alot of problems , when people , friends , and family ask for advise sometimes they dont know what to do or say . Also soon as you give the person advise they would feel less sad and worried .

Second , people also ask other people just to make sure they've got the best advise . Sometimes people get advise and dont apply it to themselvles . Also some people are good at giving advise but dont ask for any that's why you should'nt just get one person to give you there opinion .

Lastly , seeking advise from all of your friends is the best thing to do just to know what they would do if they were in your shoes . Friends all together gives the best advise because not only are they helping you in the sitiuation they are all helping eachother . You should always talk to more than one person for advise when your in an tough situation .

In conclusion, always give your opinion to friends , family and people just in general because not only are you helping them your helping others .
