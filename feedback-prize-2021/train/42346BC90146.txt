I think we shouldn't because some people might be bizzy.

And i think it is our option to do community service or not.

Because some people are probably bizzy and will not have time to do that.

And people that want to do it can do it and the people that don't shouldn't be forced.

And cause some people after school ends go to a work or go to study or go home and take care of there kids. And they people that don't do anything after school they probably just want to go home and relax or go hangout with some friends. So if the principal wants to make everybody do it then why doesn't he do it. So the people that want to do it go ahead and help the your community. But the people that don't want should not be forced to do it.

Community service is optional for those that want to and don't want to.

So theses are my examples why we shouldn't have community service.
