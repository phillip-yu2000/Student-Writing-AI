It could be a opportunity of a lifetime to travel over sea's and be a Seagoing cowboy. It can lead your family to host a number of international student to help educate them in learning like school for them. You can help people with their needs and other countries that suffer without food or water. Being a Seagoing cowboy can lead to many different adventures in life.

Luke said for being a Seagoing Cowboy he lead his family to host lots of international students and exchange visitors for many years. He overthought about going too but he just couldn't just skip this opportunity of a lifetime. He also didn't know his life would change really quick right after high school graduation. World War II was over in Europe and many countries were left in pieces.

Luke was very suprised about going over sea's.

It took him about two weeks for him to cross the Alantic ocean. It also took him a month to get to China because he was so far away from China. He has helped out his Aunt Katie's farm as a boy. Which had made him brave enough to cross the oceans just him and some other people on board of the ship or boat.

That's why I think Luke should presuade other people to join the Seagoing Cowboys. It would be a great opportunity for them. They would get to experience and see some really good, beautiful things out there. There might be some slips and falls but they would probably be fine like Luke did he fell and sliped up he ended up being fine.
