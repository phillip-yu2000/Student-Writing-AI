As a scientist at NASA and from the research made by other scientists here at NASA I can tell that this here face is nothing more than just a landform. The Face is just a natural landform, it is not created by aliens. Although many people would love to think that the Face wa created by aliens, it is not. The face is widely spred out as far as 2 miles wide. This enomous head has cought a lot of media attention such as being in a Hollywood film, appearing in books, magzines, radio talk shows, and even radio talk shows.

This landform has become a pop icon, but even with all of this attention it doesn't change the fact that it is nothing more than just another mysterious looking landfrom on Mars. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling . . . a natural landfrom. There was no alien monument after all."

After 22 years, from this first 1976 Viking 1 photograph pf the Face of Mars there was a picture that was taken of the same face ten times sharper than the original that blew away scientists and web surfers showing that there was no alien monument after all. This shows that the Face of Mars is nothing more than a natural landform on Mars.
