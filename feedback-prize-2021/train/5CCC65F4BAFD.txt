The Facial Action Coding System, is a system that can read expressions of humans. Whether they're lying, sad, mad, or happy. I think it would help with crime and school.

The uses of the Facial Action Coding System would be helpful because it'll make things so much easier with crime and school. In crime the police would be able to use this technology against the accomplice and the thief. It'll be helpful because it would be able to tell whether the thief's lying or not. this could be helpful in many different areas as well such as schools and jobs even sports.

School would be nice to have a Facial Action Coding System because it would help with cheaters and thieves. Schools have many cheaters during tests. They're sneaky and really annoying. It'll just make things easier in school because students wouldnt want to cheat anymore because they'll know that they might get caught. Other reasons why is if a student is lying to the teacher about understanding the lesson or the chapter because they're embarressed of it. The teacher could just use this piece of technology to see whether the student is actually understanding the lesson or chapter.

What I think about this piece of technolgy is that its great for many things and that this could possibly make think so much easier in the world.
