The developement of driverless cars is an important, and significant technological milestone. Driverless cars are a perfect example of how well we have devoloped sensory, atomotive, and GPS systems. They also have extraordinary potential to make travel safer, and more efficient. They could prevent countless deaths or injuries because the majority of all car accidents are caused by human error, a driverless car would never make decisions out of haste or excitement. Instead cars would travel consistantly and safely.

The developement of driverless cars could lead to several significant technological advances. Innovations inspired by driverless cars could lead to safer, or more efficient vehicles. At the same time, developing driverless cars could lead to significant inventions.

Driverless cars are the solution to the biggest cause of car accidents, human error. Thousands of car accidents are caused as a result of poor, or impaired judgement. If cars could drive themselves, this problem would be effectively eliminated. A driverless car would never make the decision to speed or run a red light.

In addition to being a safer alternative to human driven vehicles, driverless cars could also be more efficient. Driverless cars would never get lost because of their advanced GPS systems. They would also take the fastest, and safest routes. Driverless cars would rarely run out of gas because they would alwas be aware of the nearest gas station, and how much gas is in their tank.

In conclusion, Driverless cars should be fully developed, and manufactured for public use because they are a safer alternative to human driven cars. They are more efficient, as well. Also because the developement of driverless cars would be a significant technological milestone, and they could lead to newer better tachnologies.
