" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all." ( Paragraph 7) From those evidences, I know they've met important problems to solve when they were exploring Venus, but they still work on this project and try to use different ways or technology to solve those difficulties in not good conditions.
