Dear Principal,

In the cogently stated quote, Abraham Lincoln rendered "A house divided against itself can not stand". To clarify, people against each other will never accomplish anything. Together, people can do a lot more than just one persistent person can ever do. when people are against each other it can cause a lot of chaos and can even make things worse than it was in the beginning. Amazingly, participating in activities ,like community service, can bring people together and even make them stronger than before. Getting college credits, teaching responsibility, and helping the planet are some reasons community service should be mandatory.

To commence,

it should be required for students to do community service because it helps them get college credits. Surprisingly, when colleges look at applications they notice things like community service hours. Making it mandatory can help students chances of them getting into the college of their choice. If one loves animals they can do community service in a animal shelter; they can enjoy the work and still get credits out of it, so everyone wins. If someone likes children they can work at an orphanage doing simple things like putting kids in a ruby red bed or taking care of feeding them. Clearly, enjoying a job while getting college credits can really help one's future.

Furthermore, Community service teaches students about responsibility. one must be responsible to take care of a puppy or a baby. Usually, if someone doesn't have responsibility starting in community service, they have it when they are finished with it. ratiocinat
