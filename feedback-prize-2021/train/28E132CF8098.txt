Phones & Driving

Phones and driving are two bad combinations. They can lead to serious danger and harm.

People must be careful on now they use their phones while driving as it can lead to major accidents or worse. I think drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Cell phones are major distraction when driving. People/drivers can't help but to pick them up and use them. This could keep the drivers focus off the main thing which would be paying attention to the road. In these cases it could potentially be dangerous as they could cause an accident.

Next texting is also another reason why cell phones shouldn't be in the drivers capacity. Drivers often check their phones for messages or calls. This causes the driver to take his/her eyes off the road and cause an accident in a split second. The highest number of accidents come from texting and driving. This can is a major problem.

Finally music is also a problem as most times the driver don't listen to the radio as they more than often listen to the bluetooth connected to the phone. The driver may not want to listen to a certain song and try to change it which would make him/her take their eyes off the road. It could also lead to them getting badly injured.

In conclusion driving with phones is bad. We must try not to use phones as much as possible when driving it may save our lives as well as others. Doing this could also bring the accident percentage down. This could save thousands of lives maybe even more.
