Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I honestly assume it would be better if the cell phone policy in our school was to allow students to have phones out during lunch periods and free available time. If we had that privilege, I don't think kids would be so impatient to take out their phones out during school hours. The drastic amount of students in our school would be thrilled to have this privilege. Yes, school is all about education and being a good student, but I think we could append some entertainment.

Currently, we have policy number two where we can't take have our phones out at school at all.

Sometimes I do see with my two eyes that students in our school text during class, and its those certain type of kids that are the reason we don't have the privilege at all to have our phones out at all not even during lunch period. Maybe if you're reconsidering this option, we could possibly establish a noble social contract we could have this right, and kids wouldn't be so urged to take their phones out during school. Certain students like me, sometimes have to call their parent or guardian during school hours for something that's involved with school. I only use my phone during school for important intentions. Well, I believe I've given you my opinion about the school's policy for cell phones. Thank you for your time.

Your 8th Grade Student,

STUDENT_NAME.
