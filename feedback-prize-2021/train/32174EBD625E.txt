I do not belive that the electoral college should be kept as our country's voting system. The electoral college is unfair to the people, outdated and is no longer a rational method to choose our president.

The first reason That I believe the electoral college should be abolished is because we do not get to directly vote for the president ourselves. The people currently vote not for the president himself, but for a state of electors who will vote for you. The voters can not always control who our electors vote for, so in some cases, our votes may not even be contributing to the election at all. There could even be a possibilty of the candidate winning only by the majority of electoral votes. The popular vote could be completely disreguarded.

Furthermore, I do not believe that the electoral college should be our voting system because of swing states. Most of the time, candidates will spend a large portion of their time in states that will have the best effect on their outcome. Others are disreguarded and will most likely be less motivated to vote.

Finally, the electoral college should be aboliashed because of the discouaragement of minority voters. If a republican were to live in a mainly democratic state, he or she may be not be motivated to go and vote because they would feel as if thier vote does not count.

To conclude, I beleive that the elctoral college is outdated and irrational and it should be no longer used as a method of choosing the leader of our contry.
