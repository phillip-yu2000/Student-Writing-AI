Dear Principal,

I was Looking Back at your two policy decisions and in my opinion i believe the first one is better. Also, You should let us use our cell phones during lunch and break time because we may need to communicate with our family or friends. Also, Our brains will have a little brake of studying. I understand that during class we need to turn them off. Wich means we wouldn't get distracted in our education.

In the other hand if you choose the first policy of no cell phones during school. Students will still use them and it will become a bigger problem because they will use them during class. But if you let us use them during brakes and lunch we will not use them during class we will wait until brake or lunch time. Many students will even attend school more often because they will start respecting the new policy that benefit them but also the school .This is what i think about the first policy. We never get to use our cell phones in school and if you just will give us this change we will even try harder in school. Please make the correct decision that will benefit us both. And hopefully you will understand why we want the first policy. Thank you for your time.
