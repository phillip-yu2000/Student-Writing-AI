Sometimes in life, advice may be needed in any type of situation. Yes advice could be told by one person, but I believe it is better if a person is given advice from multiple people. I feel this way, because using different people's advice, in the same situation at the same exact time, could work better than listening to one person. Also seeing different perspectives from different people can make a person see a situation differently and how they might want to solve it.

First, Using multiple people's advice in unison can work better than just taking one person's advice. Look at different types of sports players. They learn different techniques from a line of coaches, teammates, and trainers to then use everything they've learned from all of these people at the same time. They know more than the average person and this makes them better in that sport. Take Stephen Curry for example, being one of the best guards in the league, he has had to get advice from all of his coaches, trainers etc. Now he uses everything that he has learned to become one of the best point guards in NBA history.

Secondly, seeing different perspectives or opinions from different people can make a person see a situation differently. Seeing how two people may think differently can make the person who is taking the advice see things differently and have another route to go with in their decision. In movies that have ghosts of Christmas spirits, the ghost takes the main characters to see themselves, but from a different view. This makes the main character change their ways. This is how seeing perspectives change the way people think.

In conclusion, advice from multiple people at a time helps a lot, because using different people's advice at the same time can make a person better at whatever they are doing. And also because seeing more than one perspective from multiple people can make whomever think differently about how they may want to solve their problem.
