Dear, Principle TEACHER_NAME

I do not think children have to do community service. It is there choice, if they want to than they can but if they don't want to they shouldn't have to. You can have the parents of the children make the decision. Maybe you can have the kids pick up garbage on Earth day. As long as it is ok with the kids and the kids parents. If you were to do that than don't make them pick up a lot. Have the kids choose how much garbage they can pick up.

Helping the community is very important, but if the children don't want to then that is up to them. Some kids may get hurt. They might pick up glass and cut themselves. It would be to much of a hassle to have all of the kids outside. Maybe you could do a indoor activity to show the kids that giving to the community is good. My example is that you good do a food drive and the kids can be in charge. It will teach them responsibility and how to help the community. Another example is You could put some garbage in the lunch room or gym and have the kids sort it and dispose of it properly. Thank you for listening to my side, Please write back as soon as possible.
