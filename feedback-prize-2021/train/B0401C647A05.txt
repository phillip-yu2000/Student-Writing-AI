Welcome my name is Luke, and I am here to tell you all to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I myself participated in this a few years back. When I graduated high school a friend of mine invited me to go to Europe on a cattleboat. Of course there are some advantages and disadvantages but, there are mostly advantages. If you have not already participated in it here are some reasons why you should.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it is a chance of a lifetime you will get to be in places like Italy, China, and Europe. You will be able to go sightseeing. As I remember I went to tour an excavated castle in Crete, I marvled at the Panama Canal, I saw the Acropolis in Greece which was special to me, and so was taking a gongola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. You will also be helping a lot of people and you can't be drafted by the military because it counts as a service. On August fourteenth we arrived we got the seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. On the way back we got to play baseball and volleyball and other games where the horses used to be. The dangers part is falling off the boat. In fact I almost fell off a boat but then I cracked my ribs. Also the job involves hard work.

Please join the Seagoing Cowboys It is a good program and you will help many people. Thank-you for reading.
