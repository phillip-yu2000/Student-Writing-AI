dear TEACHER_NAME

I think we should be able to have cell phones out during lunch time because we can text or call our parents abut after school events like basket ball practice gets done a half an hour early tonight. or if our friend is sick we could call them and tell them what home work we have to do for tomorrow. But we will not have them out in class doing any of that stuff. i would like that a lot better than having no cell phone at school because what if your basket ball, base ball ,or soccer game gets canceled or you cant get your locker open in time to get to the bus and you miss it. Then how are you going to get home? IF you had a phone at school you would not of had that problem now would you?

also if you did have a phone at school you could call your parents and tell them that you are going to tonight's foot ball because you for got to tell them that you wanted to go to it . Or your getting a ride home from a friend so they don't have they come and get you since their parent are already there and they con just take you home with them and that is my reasoning why we should have cell phones out or at school during lunch time.

sincerely
