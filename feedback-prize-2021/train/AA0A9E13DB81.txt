In the article '' Driverless Cars Are Coming '', the author talks mainly about positive outcomes for the new driverless cars. If you ask me I would most definitely disagree about this new semi-autonomous vehicle. They are too expensive, they aren't fully driverless, and they have numerous sensors that aren't guarenteed to keep you 100% safe.

My first reason would have to be how expensive this car would be. If they did manage to make a 100 % driverless car do you believe that it would be given to the public. The car alone would costs somewhere around a million dollars. Not to mention the massive upgrades to the existing roads. As stated in the passage, ''something that was simply too expensive to be practical''.

My second reason is that thay are not fully driverless. Now let me ask you something, would you like a car that you will have to take turns to drive with. Or would yo rather do it on your own . Think about it. And according to the passage,''The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over whn the situation requires''. If I had a driverless car I would put in a set destination so that I can fall asleep and wake up when I've made it where I going.

My last reason kinds of ties up with my second reason. The car is said to be loaded with all sorts of sensors which includes one on the left real wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. With all these sensors you still aren't guarenteed full safety. The car is also said to make a 3-D model of the car's surroundings. And you still need to be ready to take over the wheel in certain situations.

In conclusion, Even though the passage makes the car seem like the coolest thing in the world, they are too expensive, that aren't completely driverless, and they have numerous sensors that doesn't guarenty your safety.
