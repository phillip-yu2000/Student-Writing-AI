I totally agree with this techknowlogy!! I think its brilliant! For students to be interested in such advanced techknowlegy is mind blolwing, cool and very ineresting to me. Personally i would use this techknowlogy quite often, it could be put to good and meaningful use and could also be very fun i would say. The ability to tell all the feelings and emotions a person in a picture or painting is very amusing and helpful.

For example, you could pull up a picture of Aidolf Hitler and detect his emotions he felt while causing such desasters and woner why? why so much destruction, murder, and cruelty? Why the jews? We can try and understand there point of view. Such information could be helpful.

This techknowlegy could also be used for schoool purposes; Projects for sure! Its time students took other interests thats fun anhd will keep them occupied and or out of trouble. This techknowlegy could make a huge difference in both studants and adults. Ita also good because its another form of math. ''We can actually calculate emotions; like math homework, computers can recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. 6 emotions are classified; Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust,fear and sadness. After that they are then assosiated with each others movements of there facial muscles.

Finally therefore saying that, you can tell i really enjoy this subject; it grabbed my attention right away. I hope one day this becomes a thing because it is a brilliant idea and could really make a difference one day. Anyone at any age in any location can enjoy such techknowlogy and cololect such information.
