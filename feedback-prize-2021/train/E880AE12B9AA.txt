I think that people ask more than one person for advise on there opinion because, they want to get the most common answer. Whenever I ask for advise, I usually ask many people. If you ask

"should I study for tomorrows test" and many people say yes then you probably should.

It could also come as a bad think. Lets say you are with a group of friends and the pull out a vape and they try to peer presser you into vape, that would not be a good time to listen to what your friends try to persuade you into doing something. Maybe you will have enough common since to no not to do it because there are many bad things that can happen to you.

When you gather information you want it to be correct. It is like if you are searching something up on Google or Yahoo. You yous ally search up many things about one subject like "wear is the best place to eat in Virginia with a family of four." Because if you search up one thing than you you wont have enough information. So when you ask someone wear the best stake is in town they might say Outback and another person might say Texas Road House and maybe two more people said Outback so you now Know that Outback is the most poplar and you should go there.

When you read this I hope it gets to you. I have no clue who is reading it when I finish this but I think that you should take this advise and also get other advise, search many websites up, talk to different people about it, or just check out a couple of books. If you reed this and you just think I will start to ask more people than thats what I was trying to get you to do the whole time but, if you dont and you just ask one person thats fine. Thank you for reading my story.
