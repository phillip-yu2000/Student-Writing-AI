Limiting car usage might be a thought most of us wont even think about. But thats not the case. Countrys from all over the world are partaking in this new way. The reason why people are doing this is to clean the polluted air we breath in

A growing project that europe introduced is suburbs without cars. In Europe  a town in Germany constructed this experimental suburb project . For little to no cars in the community. This place is home to 5,500 residents and there are practically no cars, the main source of transportation is a tram. You are allowed to own aa car but its an extra $50,000 a year. In America they are not close to carring out this idea. But in the last year the number of license are going down and the number of cars being sold and hiw much we are driving. This concludes that we are taking i consideration how much emissions we are putting into the air.

In FRance, Paris enforced a partial ban on driving to clear smog of the city.

On monday motorists with even numbered plates were ordered to leave cars at home. The same would apply for the odd numbered plated the following day. Public transportation was free from friday to moday. These ideas helped clear the air of pollutants. But it took a long time because of hoiw much pollution was in the air due to France favoring diesels over gasoline.

Another way people are cleaning the air and limiting car usage is a car free day. In Bogota, Columbia  the gial of this is to promote alternative transportattion and reduce smog. Bogota is a large city homed to 7 million citzens. This idea of a day without cars was started in Bogots in the 1990's, because of this parks and sports centers have booms and many miles of bike trails have been constructed for the recreational; use but also to urge people to not use cars and clean the air.

These ideas have been expressed to reduce the usage of cars. Using cars less will have a huge effect on the ozone and how much pollutant is in the air.
