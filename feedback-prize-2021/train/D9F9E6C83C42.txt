When asking for advice, you always want to have more than one persons opinion helping you out. When there is only one opinion that you are asking for, then you have a much lower chance of coming to the best possible solution. If you need advice on something and it seems important enough to ask other people for help, then you want at least two or three people helping you out.

When people need advice, they normally need to think about the problem first. It all depends on the amplitude of the problem, and quickly it needs resolving. Asking for advice can be very difficult to some people, and easier for others, but everybody needs to ask for help at least once in their life. Some problems can easily be figured out on your own, but the more important, difficult, and time consuming the problem is, the more people you want to ask.

Having more than one opinion is the most important thing when you need help with a problem. Whether it is a problem between friends, or a personal delima, you will most likely need help. Only going to one person and asking for their opinion is one of the worst things a person can do, because it may be biased, or difficult to comprehend. Asking at least two or three people for advice is very smart and is highly recommended.

Once you have those opinions, and you cant decide which one to go for, averaging is the way to go. You can take a small part of one possible solution and mix it in with another little part of a second possible solution and so on. Then, you will have crafted the best solution for you and your problem.

So whenever you have a problem, that needs asking for advice, you always want to ask for it. Asking for at least three outside opinions is the smartest way to go. If the problem isn't that big, and you can solve it by youself, that's great. But a problem of higher amplitude needs at least three opinions to average out a possible solution.
