"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," according to Dr. Huang. This could help the teachers and instructors to know if they need to change anything about the way they are making the students learn. For example, if it shows the student being bored, they could do an activity that is more interactive and involved, rather than just sitting there and doing a worksheet. Also, if they seem confused, it gives you an opportunity to help that individual one on one. You are able to go at their pace and be patient with them so they can learn it in their own way.

Overall, this technology could be very beneficial and efficient in the school environment. It is going to help teachers gather knowledge about their teaching styles and if they need to change any thing about the way they are making students learn. Also, this is helping students to realize the certain ways that they learn and giving them knowledge as to their likes and dislikes of school. The new technology allows the teachers to have options as to what they do throughout the school day that interests the stufent and helps them learn better.
