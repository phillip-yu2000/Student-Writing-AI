I think student should do community service because it help prepare them for there future, but I also think student shouldn't have to do community service because some student play sports and have homework every day. so i think community service should be required for student not in sports. because the student in sports have to stay after school and don't always have time to finish there homework. student that are not in sports hove plenty of time to do community service around there community and still have time to hang out with there friends and do homework. but they shouldn't do community service everyday. but about twice a week for about a hour would be good to help them get ready for a job in the future. That way they wouldn't mind working eight or nine hours a day when they get a job. the student would be thankful to because the community service would show up on a job application and help them get the job they applied for. so that would be really helpful in the future.
