The facial action coding system is a computer system where it can actually tell how you're really feeling instead of just looking at your face when you're smiling and say oh, you're happy no it actually looks beyond that and can tell you hgow you're feeling.

I think the coding system could actually be helpful or valuable in the classroom . The text states that a classroom computer could recognize when the student is becoming bored or confused." If a student is on lets say like ixl ( a math website) and is stuck on a problem like they are confused the system could actually break it down and help them with the problem.

The facial coding system could actually be valuable to about almost anyone . IT could maybe replace therapists and or guidance counselors because the computer could read how theyre feeling and make them feel happy if theyre sad . It could very well ask them questions on how their day was or by simply giving them a compliment . I would keep testing it to make sure it wont mess up or make the users mad enough to where they break it or get mad at it and throw it down because what you want to do is make them happy.
