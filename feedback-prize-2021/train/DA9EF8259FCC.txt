In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author statest that " no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours.". The atmosphere around Venus is made up of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on planet Earth. So why should we try again?

Astronomers claim that Venus may once have been the most Earht-like planet in our solar system which intrigues them. They believe that there is a way to make the mission back to Venus both safe and scientifically productive. The author backs up his idea are of why it would it would be a worthy pursuit by saying "NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. They also claim that if they were not able to land on Venus they would have no way to get any samples of rock, gas, or anything else. With better equipment that is suitable for such hazardous environments then they believe there should be nothing stopping them from landing on Venus.

Overall, after reading this article, I believe that the author fully backed up his reasoning for why "studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of the dangers it presents.". If we continue to make new discoveries and try new things, we will have endless posibilities and new things to learn everyday. Like the author said " Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
