Some people think that the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens. Yes I can see what perspective they're comming from because the "Face on Mars" was up in space and space isnt just like a place here or there its our galaxy. Who knows what's going on up there everyday? Many people, even scientists believe that the "Face of Mars" was indeed infact created by aliens.

Then there was this article about the "Face on Mars" it was called, "Unmasking the Face on Mars". It stated that many people had the thought that aliens did in fact create the "Face of Mars" and NASA even had scientists go on a mission to unravel the truth about the "Face on Mars" with evidence. It stated exactly from the article, "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze." Yes that is great that they were concluding the fact that maybe perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze but they're not sure it was just an assumption. But around April 5,1998 it stated from the article that, "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." That is evidence that the "Face on Mars" was in fact a landform.

In conclution many people still think that the "Face on Mars" was created by aliens. NASA even had special missions for the curiousity with the planet and its Face. Many evidence was found through those missions and concluded that it was a landform. Even though many assumed that the " Face on Mars" was created by aliens, an image on the JPL website reveals evidence of a natural landform of the "Face of Mars".
