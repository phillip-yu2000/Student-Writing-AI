Dear, Principal

I think students should perform in community service because

I'll show little kids to think of others and not just them self's because when they get older the little kids aren't going to care but if they see the older kids help maybe the little kids would think how the big kids helped n see how much they helped them and would still want to help others when they get older. The little kids always look up to the big kids. Also maybe the little kids won't gave up so easy. Helping in community service would also help the big kids because they would be thinking of other, they will feel good about them self's when their done, and that well help them get into a good collage when they are older just for helping in the community. When the older kids have kids of their own they can tell them how they helped the community and will want their kids to be in it too. Helping others is the right way to go and to never give up in what you believe in.

Your Student,
