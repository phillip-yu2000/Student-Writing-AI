Driverless cars seem like an amazing jump into the future.

They would be a great addition to public transporation or maybe even personal use.

Google has already made some effort to making this dream a reality.

Although, these cars are not fully independent to be driving by themselves.

I believe that driverless cars would not only be better for our means of public transportation, but better for our environment as well.

Googles invisions would highly support my position.

The company is making efforts to have a public transportation system of driverless taxis.

With this improvement, today's taxis fuel usage would be halfed.

Ultimatly, the less fuel used is almost always better for our environment.

Although, it seems with every advance in technology, there is often a down side. The driverless cars are not exactly safe with modern technology. It is said that the cars can only do so much, needing a human to do some work at times.

The cars would need help with complicated traffic, work zones, and accidents.

Some accidents could even come from the cars themselves.

With the good and bad, driverless cars have much improvement to reach better safety requirements.

They wil help with minimizing the usage of fuel and public transportation trafic.

These cars have a ways to go, but thats nothing automakers can't solve.
