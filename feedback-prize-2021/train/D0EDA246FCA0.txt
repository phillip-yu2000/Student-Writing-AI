TEACHER_NAME,

Recently there has been word of limiting the sports to only the people who hold B and above averages.

I do not agree with this new policy.

Pushing students to strive to get better grades is good, in fact, it's a, must.

But it is also important for the kids to be able to enjoy what they want, and this should be segregated from extra-curricular activities.

Living in modern society presents the easy access to unhealthy foods.

Children, especially in middle school, need to eat, and exercise well to be healthy in life.

Many diet and exercise patterns are developed in this stage of life.

Banning students with C and below averages from sports will not help them with school, but interfere with their studies, as exercise stimulates the brain, and can help the students in their studies.

Limiting clubs to only B students and above is not helpful either.

During middle school, many interests that will be pursued later in life are established.

If we limit these clubs to only a minority of students, then this will not only be unhelpful to the club, it will stunt the students' ability to expand on the subject that interests them.

These clubs are sometimes taught by the teachers, and are mostly closely related to the class that they teach.

If the clubs are limited to only A and B average students, then the interest of the students' in that class may decrease.

Students do need motivation to get better grades, but limiting the school provided extracurricular activities is not motivation, but a punishment, and perhaps even borders on the edge of discrimination.

Motivation should be done on a case by case basis, and not by a one size fits all rule.

I understand your motives, TEACHER_NAME, but I do not agree.

Extracurricular activities should not be effected by a student's school grades.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
