Would it be better if students had at least one extracurricular activity? Yes a activity benefits a student very much. A activity like a sport can improve teamwork, physical health, and grades.

Having schools make the student patricipate in atleast one school activity is a great idea. A activity with more than one person in it can help teamwork. The students would learn that it is better to do things together as a team. For example soccer,in soccer you can either take the ball up the field and get the ball taken away by the opposite team or you can pass the ball to your teamates and make a goal. This is why having a activity is a good idea to make students do.

A extracurricular activity is good for students because it can improve physical health. Playing a sport can improve your endurance and strength. playing track can improve how long you can run. At the start of track you of only run a mile and at the end of track you could of ran 5 miles. Then when u come to gym and do the pacer you would be able to get a better grade because you can run faster and longer without getting tired.

Finally, a extracurricular activity can improve your grades. A club can help your grades alot. If you were to join something like a math club you could as the members for help and if they dont know something they can ask you for help. This would benefit all the club members in it. then when they come to school the next day you be way ahead of your classmates and get a good grade on all your subjects

This is why it is good for students to have a extracurricular activity at the school.
