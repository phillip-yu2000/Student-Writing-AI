Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard about your new policy. I'm afraid I have to disagree with you. Most of your students work hard and still get a C average. Please consider what I'm about to say. I feel that these kids do try and get C' s and D' s. I

hope my letter informs you of what it's like.

If the students are obviously trying hard, will you at least give them a chance? Besides, it would be nice to have something to look forward to! Right?

Now If someone is a "slacker", (a slacker is someone who doesn't even try,) then why should they play the games? I then agree and understand.

Trust me, I don't reward for

Getting grades aren't all that easy. Thing could be bad at home and the student may not be getting the help he or she needs. Sports Helps some peoples emotion's. Could you try and think about what it's like for some people? God made us all different.

Think about it, for an example, if there is someone who is always cheerful, attempting their home and school work, but getting bad grades, would you take away their dream of being a famous football star, or basketball MVP? Have you ever had a dream that you never got to fulfill? I personal know what it feels like Under a different circumstance though.

I hope I have helped you see what it's like from the students perspective.

Thank you for taking the time to read my note and feelings toward your policy. We as a school respect your time and effort to keep us going strong, even if some don't participate.

Your Student,

STUDENT_NAME
