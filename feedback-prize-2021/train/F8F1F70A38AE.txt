To TEACHER_NAME,

I don't believe in making all those student who have a C average unable to participate in sports and other activities. It's just plain wrong! I don't understand why exactly a student who just happens to have a C average,

which, by the way, is a passing grade! If there are a great number of student who have a C average, and there are, than that means you should just leave it the way it was! Students enjoy the extra activities! It gives them time to work out all the energy they have built into there systems every day! Also it's a time to get a break from school and a reliever of stress. Or maybe the just really love what they do! It's also a very healthy way to stay in their best shape possible, and we all completely know that! So I'm going to hope that you see the light of this and let us ALL do what we love.

With all hope in mind,
