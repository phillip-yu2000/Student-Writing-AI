When people first say this "face" it was from a picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took. Additional reasearch and pictures have been done to see if this is actually a face, just a huge rock formation, or an alien monument. It has shown that it is just a huge rock.

I say its only a huge rock because the passage mentions unusual shadows. THese shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth causing it to look like a face. They did not just form any

"face" that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So we know now that t was just a huge rock formation with shadows on it. It is not an actual face carved into rock.

The passage mentions that Michel Malin and his MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the same landform only ten times shaper thn the original. When they looked at this picture it revealed a natural landform. So after all this it wasnt an alie monument after all.

Now the image doesnt show a face and its not an alien monument it is a butte or mesa. Those are commo landforms aroung the american west. So we know for sure not that the "face on mars" is actually just a landform with a bunch of shadows that give the illusion of a face. Well thats the truth about the "face on mars"i kinda hope you dont still blieve that it is an alien monument or an acutal face. If you still believe that then you might want to reread this paper.
