When people seek for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. The reasoning behind this is, that one person can give better advice, the other can be easier to understand, and the person asking for advice possibly wants more information from more than one person for more information.

Some people always look for the best advice from others, but some give out bad advice with no effort put in to it. "It's always better to make a pizza with all of the ingredients" as some say for this reason. Having more information can be better for some people in many different ways. This can possibly help someone succeed.

Other people have some trouble understanding things sometimes. So it can be easier to understand if the advice was explained in a simple way. For example, having a younger audience can be hard to explain to them in a "adult" form, but keeping it simple can help you get to your point with them. Even adults have a hard time understanding, just a better way of explaining things can help others.

Getting different opinions of advice is another great way to find it. You can find some pros and cons from other peoples point of view. It's like baking a cake, what are the best things to use to the worst things to use, always look for the best of it. Advice from others can help you find more of what you want.

When people seek for advice they talk to more than one person. It can possibly help someone succeed some where in life. Explaining it in a simpler way can be easier for people to understand. Or getting different opinions from others help you more. Will you find better ways to get advice from others?, or is your own advice better for yourself?
