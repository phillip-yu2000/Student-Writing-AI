Venus aka the evening star is one of the most stunning and complex plant we have in solors system. The reaeon why it is stunning and complex is because of how closely the density and size and also occasionally closest to the sun and in distance too, Earth, venus, and mars which make a challenging place to even examine more closely.

The reason why venus is such a dangersous place to pursuit studying up closer is becacuse of hot it is. The atomsphere is about 97% thick making cardon dioxide cover down on venus with strong persureof 90 times greater than what humans experience as it reads on paragraph 3. Another reason why its a challenge are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atomosphere which is a type of rain that is acid which is very harmful. But the overall temperatures is a average of 800 degrees fahrenheit. The terrians or surface of venus are like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking on its land which is supported by the author on paragraph 3

But it is it posslbe for us to study the up close the unbarably hotest of venus and fully understand the plant true mysteris, and the answer to that question is a 50% 50% yes and no. The reason why it is because arcodaring to NASA and the author on paragraph 5 they state that since 1940s during WWII NASA have been working on studyings and projects. Like looking back at old technology called "Mechanical computers" and these deveices help and play a role for 1st roll of envisioned. But mainly the "Mechanical computers" are upgrade to more modern computers that enormously powerful, flexible,

and quick but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme condititons like venus supported by paragraph 7.

But overall these are the reason why is hard and complex to studying venus in a up close postion.
