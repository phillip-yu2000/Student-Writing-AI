The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports this idea by stating in paragraph 8, "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." This statement supports my claim by explaining how the author believes no one should let the fear of the dangers that may arise stop them from exploring the world and beyond. Instead the author believes people should go after whatever they want to find. Paragraph 8 also states, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." This evidence explains how the author feels that there will be scary and intimidating obstacles that will arise on the journey of exploring the planet with the hottest surface tempurature in our solar system, but the author believes the curiosity of humans leads us to danger. The author also believes that danger shouldn't stop anyone who is curious from exploring. This article may talk about serious dangers, but also gives ideas for humans to study Venus without being put it any danger. The author states in paragraph 5, "NASAÂ’s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape." This solution may prevent any harm to humans who want to study this planet and learn more about it. This solution gives people a chance to stay curious, and not think about the dangers. Only think about the journey and mystery that lies ahead.
