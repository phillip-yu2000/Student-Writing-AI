Having limted car usage is very healthy for our world. We should have an international Car-free day! Bogota, Colombia does it every year! why not the whole world? In Paris, they partially banned carsl. According to "Paris bans driving due to smog" On Monday cars with an even-numbered liscense plate were not allowed to drive. The car traffic lowered 60%! Me being from Miami that's amazing! Not being scared to cross the street and actually make it somewhere on time is really great.

In Bogota, Colombia; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, very smooth sidwalks; rush-hour restrictions have cut traffic tremendousally! Carlos Arturo Plaza said "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," while on a two-seat bike with his wife. Stated in "The end of car culture" A study from last year found that driving by young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009. So if young people are already limiting their car usage, Why not the whole world?

I'm just trying to incourage people to limit their car usage. Like in Bogota and Paris, having so little traffic. It reduces the smog in the air. Having better sidewalks for people who doesn't have a car can walk on with out tripping. If it's impossible to have an international car-free day, let's have a major city car-free day or atleast incourage everybody to limit car usage would really help this world!
