Dear principal,

This is a story of why I think it would be good to let students have phones during school I think us students should be able to have our phones because it could save our lives, it can help us during school, and it could help the school save money.

Firstly, they can save our lives. What if we got into a incident where we had to call for help, and we had to get someone to safety fast. We can't run down that could take minutes that we could take away someone life. That's why I think we should have phones in case of emergency. There could be a storm that wipes out all the schools power, so that would mean no phones, no computer, and more importantly no help. That is my way of thinking what could happen.

Second, phone could help us during and out of school. Some phones might have texting ability and that could help your buddy, like for intense say if one of your friends missed a day and there was some important notes. He or she would really want to know that information there could be a test the next day; he or she is in trouble. You starting to see how they could help now.

Next, they can help schools save money. There are some things that schools use that could be program on phones that are free like a calculator. We use calculators every day of our lives so why not replace those costly calculators with the cooler, nicer, and down right awesome cell phones.

My final reason, I really think that phones in school could really improve the Untied States education. They can help, save our lives, and save our school money. Thank you for reading.
