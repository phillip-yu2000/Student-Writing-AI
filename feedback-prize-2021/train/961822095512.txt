Driverless cars are the cars of the future. Humans are getting lazier and lazier and we need technology to fulfill our needs. Driverless cars are the perfect solution to our laziness. They are safer and more reliable than regular cars. Regular cars pose a threat to our safety. Regular cars have to be driven by drivers who aren't always paying attention to their surroundings.

Driverless cars may sometimes need to be driven by a user in certain situations. In the event of road work or an accident, the driver must take over the wheel and steer around the hazard. Companies are working on new technology so that cars become completley driverless. Companies are trying to put car-entertainment systems in vehicles so the driver is entertained.

In a few years, there will be driverless cars. There is no doubt about that. It is just a metter of when, and how they will come about. I am all for driverless cars. They are the future of automobiles.
