Dear Principal,

Nowadays most kids carry around cell phones for emergencies or just to be able to connect with each other. I strongly believe kids should be able to bring their phones to school incase of family emergencies or because of a medical problem. Even though many kids use them to mostly socialize they can be very useful in a life or death situation. For example, If a student was having a medical problem during lunch and they couldn't reach the clinic in time they could take out their cell phone and ask their parents to pick them up immediately. I strongly recommend policy as opposed to not being able to have immediate help.

Another reason kids should be able to have cell phones on campus is that they can call for help when they are seriously injured and there's no one around to help them. Like say that someone had fallen down a flight of stairs and had shattered their arm and there's no one around to hear them call for help, they could whip out their phone and dial for help. As for not having them on in class, I completely agree because they shouldn't be on at all time on campus.

All In all I think students should be able to carry around a phone incase of impending danger and or a medical problem. I hope you agree with my statement and have good judgement.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
