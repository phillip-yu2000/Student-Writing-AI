Dear

TEACHER_NAME,

I take the position on how students should be required to perform community service. The kids say they have better things to do or they have no time, but the obviously have enough time to watch television or go on the internet. So they should be required to do community service. You could require a certain amount of hours per month, year, or even week. This way they know how much time they have to perform so they can make time. Also the community service sounds like it takes a lot of effort, but it really doesn't if you actually do it for a certain amount of time.

Many students have recess or core plus or extra time in their school day because i used to have core plus and it would be useless when there was no activity to do. Well you could give the teachers work or some ideas and have the students do some community service to fill in hours or any another requirement. Putting community service in a students everyday schedule will be adjusted because its another requirement in school that they can achieve. If the students do the service it will pay off in maybe a reward or another prize of some sort. This way students will actually perform the service with more effort. Giving the students requirements will make them participate in community service, and i know that there is at least a half an hour in everybody's day.

Another reason why students should be required to participate in community service is because it makes our community a better place. Maybe picking up trash on the side of the school or roads near the school could help our community. Or helping the disabled students in our school could be counted as community service because it help our society. Taking the time to help other people or our environment or even our school can come in big rewards. To get students started on the job, the service should be required. On small step can lead to big achievements.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
