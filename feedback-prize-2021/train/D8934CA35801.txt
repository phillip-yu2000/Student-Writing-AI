Teachers should not be able design the students project because the students might have have trouble on the assignment the teacher gives them over the break and they wont be able to get help because the teacher and the students will be on break and it will make it hard for the students to finish the work and if students choose what they want to do for their project it will be easy and understandable for them and they can do a lot of research on what they they do on their project and when the students get to do what they want n the project they can get good credit on the assignment if the teacher gets to choose what the student does on there project then then the students will have a hard time thinking and coming up with ideas for there assignment and probably wont do good on the project and fail if students get to design what they want to do on there project then there creativity will go up and the way they think will be differentÂ and if they design it themselves then they will be more intrested in the assignment then if the teacher did designed it then the students would probably wont do the assignment.
