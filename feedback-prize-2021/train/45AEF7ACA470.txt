Have you ever wondered what it would be like if humans didn't have to control the car? I think driveless cars is a good idea but at some time humans will have to take over. I say this because it would be less acidents, there will be less tickets , and people without lisences can't drive.

One reason why I think it's a good idea is because it will be less acidents. The computer will know what to do in different situations. And i think they should have a monitor on when the computer drives and when the person drives. At what place and what time. Then you will know who to blame for any acidents.

Another reason why i think it's a good idea is because there will be less tickets. If the car knows what speed limit to go or when to stop then there would be no problem with running past lights and stop signs. And you can't lie about it was the computer because it follows the rules , and they have it monitered on the car.

My last reason is because there is a lot of people out there that doesn't have a lisents and they are still driving. If you have to show your lisents or put it into somewhere so the computer knows you are allowed to drive than there wouldn't be a problem.

There are so many good reasons why you should have drivless cars. But theses are my 3 reasons why i think we should have them.
