Dear Principal,

I would like to have policy one enforced in our school. If it were it could help students stay out of trouble during class. Then if as if they were in class and NEEDED to use there cell phone.

Then probably they may stay more focused on there work during class if they knew they were allowed to use afterwards. Also that could cause some problems student could get cyber bullied a lot more now, but that might make a big difference in the schools today. So even student may excel using there phones because of the fact say STUDENT_NAME

sent a text STUDENT_NAME and said "Hey was there any math homework". STUDENT_NAME said "Yes

, it was page 487 number 2 - 20 even and it was all addition problems so there easy." STUDENT_NAME

would say "Oh well thank you." A situation like that is helpful, in a way to STUDENT_NAME. that's why policy 1 should be enforced more than policy 2. Overall therefore I would like REALLY like for you to consider policy 1.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
