The use of the technology called the "Facial Action Coding System" is valuable in the classroom. It can make the teaching less stressful and more fun. The teacher can know exactly how the student is feeling and how they can change the lesson up.

With the new technology that Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman are developing, you can tell how your friend in schools are feeling. In the article, they said, "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc." The technology can give you way more details that just saying "mad", "happy", or "sad".

Another reason why the technology will be good in school is because the students can also tell how the teacher is feeling towards them or the lesson. The student will be able to tell if the teacher is bored or having fun, when they're not showing it. For example, "Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcuding emotional communication." Sometimes the teacher doesn't verbally say how thye are feeling.

If the new technology does big in school, they might just sell them in the stores for families at home. Families need to always know how each other is feeling. As the kids get older their emotions change and sometimes get better or worse. The author said, "your frontails pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyeborws when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger." Kids at home do that all the time to show how they are feeling.

I think that the use of the "Facial Action Coding System" is a excellent technology to use in the school. The technology will help the school a whole lot better then it is now. Nobody will have to struggle to figure out exactly what somebody is feeling.
