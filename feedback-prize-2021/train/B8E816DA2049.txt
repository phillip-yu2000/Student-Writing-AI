Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I heard you are considering two cell phone policies. One where no cell phones at all another where students can use it during lunch and free time. I am writing to you because I would agree with the policy where they can use it during lunch and free time.

I believe students should use cell phones during lunch and free time because they tend to sneak using their cell phones in class. If they know they look at it or text someone later then they won't need to use their phone and that would eliminate the distraction of the cell phone in class. When it comes to not handing things in, the students could just call or text their parents in between classes and therefore by handing the assignment in on time the students grades would improve. Even if something comes up and their parents are at work and they need to let them know their not staying after school then they should be able to tell them. What if someone forgot he/ she was having a friend over and needed to be picked up. Now they could just call instead of at the end of the day and have to wait for ten minutes while they waited for the parents pick them up.

When you can't use cell phones assignments are handed in late due to the fact they'll be left at home. Students will sneak using their phones in class and by doing that they will either get caught and get in trouble or be distracted in class. Also students could be waiting long after school because their parents could forget to pick them up or will not be notified to.

I hope you take these factors into consideration when making your decision. Thank you for reading this.

Sincerely,

Your 8th grade student
