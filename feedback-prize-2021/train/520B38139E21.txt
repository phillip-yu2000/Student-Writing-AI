The Wonder of Driveless Cars

I am all for the the accessibility of having driveless cars . The ability of having access to living in a society of driveless cars would be mind blowing and marvelous. The fact that we could get from place to place without the need of being focused and aware on the road at all times. We would be able to interact with one another better and being able to be more more productive. Also we would have the ability to be safer on the roads with self driving cars than regualrs ones.

If we had driveless cars we would be able to interact with one another better. The way we would interact better is that we have more time on our hands with this time we would be able to talk to our family and friends in the cars with us or able to facetime or call someone we haven't talked to in a while . Another way we could benefit from having self driving cars is that we could be more productive with school or work . We could do any homework or work related assignments in the cars that we can't do at the moment because we have to be focused on the roads. In doing so we have the ability to move forward faster in our careers. The last reason why i am for having self driving cars is that we would be safer on the road because of sensors decribed in the passage. With futher improvement in sensors and computer hardware to make driving safer we are leading to a future with possible fewer crashes and traffics jams.

I am all for the ability to have driveless cars. having the access to having cars that are safer and will makes us more productive with work and our personal relatioships will be wonderful . The chance of having driveless cars in the future will be amazing and marvelous.
