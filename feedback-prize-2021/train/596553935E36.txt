Peolpe should join the program because you kinda become an explorer and see a buch of part of the world like how Luck did when he became a Seagoing Cowboys.

When he saw the Acropolis in Greece, also a toured an castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panna Canal on his way to China.

In the other hand Luke almost went flying of the boat in the dark Alantic Ocean when he was a watchman and had to check the animals every hour.

Still when he became a Seagoing

Cowboy it changed his life and maybe it can change yours to see the whole world in person.

Luke was a brave man to become a Seagoing Cowboy during World War 2.

You clould alos incourage people to become a Seagoing Cowboy and help other people.

You never know if you could change the world by becoming a

Seagoing Cowboy. May this could be a opportunity of a lifetime because it was that way for Luck and if he said no a bunch of people could be helpless.

Think about it traveling through the world see things you never saw before.

Could you change people's lifes by joinig in the Seagoing Cowboy Program.
