While the Face on Mars does look like a face, there is no way possible that it could be an alien artifact. Research, advance in technology, quotes from scientists, and actual evidence proves that this is just a natural landform on Mars. Mars has had plenty of speculation on this, yet all the answers have come back that it is impossible. No, there is not a lot of evidence, but there is enough to show that this is just a mesa.

When scientist first found the Face, it was already speculated to be a mesa. This was because of the place where it was located, Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having many mesas in its area. This one just happened to have shadows on it appearing like a face. Let us not forget that the Face was found in 1978. That is when space travel was still a new for the world. Technology was not that advanced as it is today. The last picture was taken in 2001, which was twenty years later after the first photograph was taken. Spacecraft and photos had improved twice as much.

Even though technology has improved we still cannot tell whether it is an alien or not. We must go off of facts. Scientist Jim Garvin stated that,"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, id there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could not see what they were!" This shows that the Face could not even of been seen. So, it is impossible that it was an alien artifact.

Mesas and buttes are very common on Mars. Especially in Cydonia. Technology has improved and there is no way we could see a face from that size. "That's a lave dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars," said Garvin. Research and results have proven that the Face is just a landform like any other on earth.
