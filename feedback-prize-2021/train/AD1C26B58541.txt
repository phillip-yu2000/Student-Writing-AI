Driverless cars are not a way that the future should go. Self driving cars will do more harm than good. Developing these cars as a way of the future will hurt mankind. We will lose an entire job sector, an important skill in the form of driving, our laws as stated in the article will have to be overhauled to accomodate this change, and not to mention technology isnt always reliable it will break at some point usually the most inoportune time.

When science develops a fully operational car there will be the problem of soon humans will not see the need to learn to drive. This is similar to when humans developed the ability to buy meat from a grocery store now we dont know how to hunt or butcher to get meat for outselves since all we have to do is buy it. This scenary will be the same with driving soon humans wont know how. Then of course what will happen to taxi drivers when their job is outsourced to a cheap computer driven car. Or a truck driver when his job is taken over by machine. The standiard patrol ploice officer wont be able to catch speeders either becasue they arent drving. Changing all of our driving laws will be a necessity. As stated in the article who is at fault the car manufacterure or the so called "driver" of the vehicle in the event of a crash. Laws will have to change for this as well. Which goes on to the other part of the problem technology fails at any given time. What happens when this autocar skips a few stoplights.

So in conlcusion self driving should not be the way of the future. The cons far outway the pros. Jobs would be lost, more people killed, and most importantly humans will lose yet another valuable skill.
