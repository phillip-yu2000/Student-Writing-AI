One Club

Parents and other people think it is good to have extracurricular activity for kids. People say that it helps kids interact with other kids. People also say that it takes time away from them going on their phone. I also agree that every kid should have to take one. You are not taking five or six it is just one. I think this would be a great thing to do. It would help kids find, or improve there hobbies. A hobby is some thing you like to do. Hobbies are cool and there are a lot of your hobbies at school in the from of after school activity. They even can fit the your week. You can even find friends that like the same thing you do. There are clubs that are just certain grades.

Clubs are on every day of the week. Like how on Mondays kids go to running club, or on Thursday kids go to drama club. Kids do all sorts of cool clubs. Clubs are made to be on all sort of days Monday, Tuesday, Wensday, Thursday, and Friday. There are a bunch of clubs here are some. You have running club, drama, lacrosse, chess, girl scouts, yearbook, vex, knitting, battle of the books. You see that is just some of them. Maybe you should try one?

There other good thing about having extracurricular activity. Maybe you will meet someone that likes what you like, and you guys or girls will be friends. You could also have a better relationship with the teacher who teaches the club. I could see you thinking but if there are little kids, and they can be a little annoying. If you ask but what if the older kids run me over. Then there is a place for you because there are clubs that are just older or younger kids.

I think it would be great to have every person to do one extracurricular activity. There are many factors that they are good. Like they can fit your week, there are a lotÂ of club to pick from, meet new friends,and last but not least there are age clubs too.
