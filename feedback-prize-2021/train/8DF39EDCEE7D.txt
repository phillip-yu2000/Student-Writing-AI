Many students don't have any hobbies or interests in school or home. I agree that all students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity because it can get students to try something new, build new friendships with others, and get some experience of how it works.

One reason I agree that all students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it can get students to try something new. Most students don't really get hooked on to the topics their learning in actual school because they don't really reach out/don't look or sound appealing, but if students have to participate in one activity, they'd get more hooked or interested on one topic or activity because it may be enjoyable, welcome, or they might find it fun.

Another reason I agree that all students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it can build new friendships with others. Students often have friends, but some people don't get to feel how its like to have someone on your back. So, if students have to participate in one activity, they can find new friendships with their local club members or council. In addition, this will also get people who already have friends some new friendships as well, by introducing them to new people, and getting to know them better than just simple classmates.

Another reason I agree that all students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because students can get some experience of how it works. Even if the activity is uninteresting or boring, it still teaches you something about that topic, worthless or not, it can still teach you something and even maybe going in the shoes of some jobs or positions.

So, in conclusion, I agree that all students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity because it can get students to try something new, build new friendships with others, and get some experience of how it works.
