Cell phones have become very popular. Almost everyone who is old enough to drive owns a cell phone. They have become a part of life. Cell phones are an asset this day and time, but they can also be very dangerous. Although cell phones are a necessity, I do not think they should be used while driving.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. You shouldn't be on your phone while driving. It causes all types of tragic deaths. The best way to stop it is to enforce the no use law. People die almost every day from this. When you drive and text it causes accidents and deaths. People have a hard time with texting and driving. They just have to pick up the phone that instant. To me, I fill like electronics are evil to humans because since they dropped the first phone the death rates has increase.

Using your phone and driving is just like drinking and driving. I saw my mother actually texting and driving and she slam on brakes. It was very scary at the moment because we were young. People just love to do that. I'm not going to lie if the phone call is important to me, I am going to answer it, but I will try to pull off of the road first. I do not want to cause an accident and hurt myself or someone else just to answer a call or text. That can wait.

Using cell phones while driving put everyone's life in danger. We don't know what the person behind the wheel is going through. There is nothing so important it can't wait. Next time you get that phone call or text while driving, wait until you stop the car to answer it. You could save your life or the life of someone else.
