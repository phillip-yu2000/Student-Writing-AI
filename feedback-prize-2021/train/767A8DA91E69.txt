No one starts off knowing what to do in life, you can't be sure until you've tried many different things. That's why I think Each student should have to participate in extracurricular activities outside of their classes in school. Extracurricular activities are a great way to engage students brain's in subjects they're passionate about and is also a good way for students to find new hobbies. Without the students being exposed to many different activities they might never find their talent and what they want to pursue in life.

After school activities are a great way to keep the brain working even after the school day is over. Students can stay active whilstÂ doing something they are passionate about like a sport or community service. For instance I do yearbook in school as one of my electives and sometimes I like to work on designs, quotes, and formatting at home. This is a great way to stay active by doing something that I like and something that benefits the school as well.

Putting students out of their comfort zones by encouraging them to try new things is also a great way for students to find activities that want to pursue. Maybe someone has played soccer ever since they were in second grade and they've never tried basketball, however when they get to middle school they finally try basketball and realize they love it. You can never be sure that you dont want to do something until you try it. For instance Lebron James didnt know he wanted to play basketball until he was introduced to it so you never know if your going to be the next star.

If every student did one or more extracurricular activity everyday the school could accomplish so many more projects. Students would be encouaged to pursue topics they're passionate about and would have the freedom of choice and they would also find new things they love doing and create new expiriences. All they need is a little encouagement.
