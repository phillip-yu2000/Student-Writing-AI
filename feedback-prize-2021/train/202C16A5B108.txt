Dear principal,

You should let kids play even though they have below a B.

They should be allow to play with below a B because they still are passing.

Also you should let kids play because they could be really good. Or really bad but you should still give them a chance at playing sports.

They should be allowed to play because they probably will have a good chance at being really good. Also because they could pull their grade up while they are playing to keep playing and they would have a good grade.

Also you should let them play because its not fair for some people to be able to play and some not be able. That would be very rude and not nice for some to play with a good grade and he might not be able to play at all. That's why

I think that all kids should be able to play no matter what the grade is.
