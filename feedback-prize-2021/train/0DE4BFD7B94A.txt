Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Lately, there has been some discussion around the school on whether or not students should be required to perform community service.

In my opinion, it should not be required.

Community service, while it does help the community, takes lot of time.

In our school's society, homework is extremely important.

Students are required to take time and put all of their effort into completing homework thoroughly and correctly.

When students do this, they maintain the maximum understanding of the material.

If students were required to perform community service, homework quality might decrease.

After-school activities are also a necessity for a student.

They help students get extra energy out, while keeping them in shape and healthy.

Community service might build character, but in my case, and many others, after-school sports and activities help my focus during the school day.

If students think of community service as a requirement, they might not get the same benefits.

Even though I think that community service should not be a requirement, I do think it should be promoted throughout the school community.

If community service is an important part of someone's everyday life, then they can set up clubs or get a group of people to perform community service with them.

For example, someone could set a club focused on learning about and volunteering at animal shelters.

These clubs can get the rest of the school involved by setting up a fundraiser for the whole school to donate to.

Community service can also get included in the school's curriculum.

For instance, students could research a local charity and present their findings to the class.

I hope you understand my position and consider my ideas.

I am sure that community service can be recognised in the school community without taking away from students' education.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
