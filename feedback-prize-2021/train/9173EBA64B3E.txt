Phones and Driving

Hmmm, should teenagers drive with cell phones? In my thoughts they shouldn't because more and more people are dying because teens and their cell phone use. People should really consider what they do before the do it. They might end up regretting it in the end.

One reason a teen shouldn't drive with phones is because they pay more attention to their phone than to the road. Over the past couple years 3,328 people were killed due to being distracted by their cell phone while driving. If teens just put their phone down and realize that life is more important than your phone, all of these deaths would decrease. I want people out there to think before they pick that phone up while driving. Is that phone call or text worth it?

Teens don't have much experience as an adult. Adult drivers are much more mature and advanced with driving. They could text and drive, but they have much more sense and consider the other drivers. Teens are quick to check their phones when they get a text. Use your brain for once and do not pick the phone up.

In conclusion, teens really shouldn't drive and text. You may think that you are very experienced at driving but you're not. Take the time out and think to yourself, "Is my phone more important than your life or another person's life." How would you feel if you killed somebody because you were texting and driving?
