If you can't decide between two or more things, you can always get other peoples opinions. But why? Why as humans do we care about other peoples opinions? How can that help us? Well, I got some answers for you! There are a couple of different reasons why you might ask for someones opinion. These reasons might be to see their point of view or to get more opinions.

Every person has an unique personality. With an unique personality comes a new perspective. A different perspective can be good because they could have ideas that you never even thought of. You can even work together with the other person, so that you both have new and original ideas.

Another reason why someone might want to ask people for advice is to get more opinions. Lets say that your having a birthday party. You love chocolate cake, so you bought one. No one invited to the party likes chocolate cake, so they don't come. Now you have a party that no one came to and a lot of chocolate cake. I think in a situation like this, you should let the majority pick the cake. If the majority picks vanilla, but you still want chocolate, you can get both.

In conclusion, ask for other peoples opinions. It will help you in the long run. Who knows? You may even discover your love for vanilla cake! You don't have to listen to this, but it will help to see that the reason why people ask for advice is to see other peoples point of view and to get more opinions. The next time you do anything try to see if anyones opinion would matter.
