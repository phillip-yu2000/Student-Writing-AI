Dear Principal,

Good Afternoon, I hope all is well. I am writing to you regarding my opinion on weather you should require all students to perform community service. Well, I personally think all students should be required to perform community service, because it can really help the less fortunate and homeless. And with our community working together to help one another we can rapidly make the world a better place.

There are many ways students can help their community. For example they can cook food and send it to a local soup kitchen, donate food or clothing to the poor, or even form a resistance group to help stop world hunger! I think its possible for students my age to change the world to make it a better place. Which by that we would also be following the ways of Jesus. There are many commercials on television that persuade children my age and younger to help make the community a better place and I for one am fully in favor of it. I think its great that there is other people in the world like us that want to help the community and the less fortunate.

It would really make a huge difference if you required all students to perform at least 15 hours of community service to help others.

Sincerely Your 8th Grade scholar,
