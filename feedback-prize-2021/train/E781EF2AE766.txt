I think we should keep it to election by popular vote for the President of the United States .The electorial college consist of 538 electors . A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President . Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation : one for each member in the House Of Representatives plus two for your senators . Each candidate running for President in your state ha shis or her own group of electors.

The Presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. I know are President hasn't done everything he said he was going to do yet but it takes time to be patient .Its We The People that are trying to have what's best for everyone.

Over 10,0000 people have the right to help choose are new President .The electorial college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast .The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus there campain rfforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campain .
