In my opinion seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice of what to do, and what not to do. Another reason is that it can help someone not make the wrong choice in life. Another reason is that the first person they talk to might be trying to harm them so they tell them a bad decision. The last reason is that someone can help you become more successful than others can cause they might be trying to bring you down and other people are trying to boost the persons confidence.

Having multiple opinions can help someone not make the wrong choice. For example going out and hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into trouble. Another example is fighting cause your friends do it doesn't mean you have to do it. Like having a kid at a really young age can effect your life. So if I was this person I would seek multiple opinions.

If you seek multiple opinions people can tell you what and what not to do. Like smoking is really bad for you so you don't do it cause your friends are doing it, or because you think it's cool and makes you cool. For example my sister started smoking cause she thought it was cool but it wasn't and now she does it everyday, and it makes her look like a bad person. So take the right path not the wrong one.

Someone can help you become more successful if you listen to their opinion. Some people don't like to see other people successful so they say something that is going to bring you down. Most people want other people to be successful so they help guide them on to the right track or they help them get to the point of a successful life.

Therefore,just listen to other peoples opinions and maybe they can help you out to accomplish your goals. So don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something because you can do anything god lets you do.
