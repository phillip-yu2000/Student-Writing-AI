Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should allow students to do policy number one. If we have phones we should be able to use them in between classes and at lunch time. As long as we don't disturb the student body it should be ok. Say if some one forgot there lunch at home how will the parents know. I tell you how the student will text them or call them but what will happen they will get their phone taken up by a teacher. That's just not right. I mean how will the student even each lunch then. So me and the entire student body agrees the we should be able to use our in between periods and at lunch. So I'm asking as a friend as an every day student let us use our phones through out the day. If you this for us i promise i will participate in every fundraise we have.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
