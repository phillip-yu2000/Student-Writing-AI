Keeping a B average is not as easy as it seems. Just a couple bad assignments can throw you down to a C, and its hard to put all your time and effort into schoolwork if you do sports. This is why students should not have to keep a B average to do sports.

In order to keep a B average, students would have to put all their time and effort into their schoolwork, which is hard to do if you spend three hours a day doing a school sport. Here's what RELATIVE_NAME school day looks like. RELATIVE_NAME gets out of school at 3:00, and goes right to football practice. RELATIVE_NAME practices until 6:00, and rides a bus home, which takes 30 minutes. RELATIVE_NAME gets home at 6:30, and does his chores until dinner at 7:00. When he finishes dinner he quickly finishes the nightly homework, because if he put any time into finishing it, he would be in bed by midnight, and would only get 6 hours of sleep. Some of RELATIVE_NAME's friends are in band and football, and have to practice their instruments for 30 minutes each day, along with chores, and 5 periods worth of homework.

Also, C average is a passing grade, for some people, passing is hard enough, so to make them go above the level of expectation, is a lot to ask. For people like me, it is not hard to get an A or B, but for people with a lot less time on their hands it can be very difficult. I used to play school volleyball, and I was having a lot of problems keeping my grades up, so I decided to quit, in order to keep my grades up.

For many people, keeping a B average would not let people get nearly enough sleep to stay awake during their classes, and it is unreasonable to make them have a grade above passing if they participate in a school sport. Unless you want sleeping students in your classroom, and many upset students, don't make them keep a B average.
