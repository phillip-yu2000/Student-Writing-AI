In the story " The challenge of exploring venus"

the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit. venus its proved to be the most challenging place to examine. In paragrah 1 they said that "venus is the second planet from the sun", which makes it harder to see up close .venus is one of the plants that that havent been search yet sp that whats make venus one of the plants that need to be search and worthy to do so. In my opinion i think they should study venus more because its a lot of thiings they can discover and they can know more about the planet. Venus in my words is a more secretive plant because no one has ever successfully sent a spacecraft up to venus and it came back. In paragraph 2 it said that "venus has a reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study", which means that venus is still left unknown and has no research on venus. Another fact about venus is that it is the mist earth like planet in our solar system. In conclusion, i think that venus is so special because we dont really know too much about venus as we do to the other plants that's why it makes venus so important and worthy to figure out because we dont have too much proven facts about it.
