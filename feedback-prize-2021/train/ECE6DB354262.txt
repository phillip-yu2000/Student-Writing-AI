Imagine, you are a student stuck doing a required assignment you truly dislike;summer break is almost over and you don't have the motivation to complete it because schoolwork feels like a chore. The information your teacher discussed in class left as soon as the last bell rang in June, so you're also clueless. You might shrug it off until the last moment or just not do it at all.

To avoid this dilemma, schools that require students to complete Summer assignments should give students the freedom to design the project themselves. If students are truly passionate about their work, they would be more likely to complete the assignment. This way students maintain the information they obtained in class and have an outlet to express their creative side. This may also benefit students who cannot learn in a classroom setting due to severe anxiety or other mental illnesses and are confused for the next year. It can be hard reteaching yourself something but not if you put your heart into it and design a project to fit your academic needs.

Teacher's may argue that students will choose an easier route and not challenge themselves. They will also argue they worry that the students wont be creative. To avoid this teachers should create a rubric that the students must follow. This allows the teacher to grade the project on effort, creativity and neatness but also allowing the student to do what they please with the assignment. They may also fear that students might be inappropriate with their designs. However, teachers can discipline them by reporting them or writing them up.

Education is important and Summer projects can be tough. Especially if you're in no school mode already. If students are able to design their own projects they can reteach themselves what they might have forgot over Summer break. Not everyone learns the same so this would give students an opportunity to expand their minds.
