Dear Florida State Senator,

We, the people have been given the Electoral College in order to allow both us and congress a say on who will be the next face of our country. I know that you should not fix what is not broken, but maybe it time to allow some changes in our election. The Electoral College attempts to maintain a fair voting process, but like many great ideas it comes with a few kinks.

"Non-swing" states have it rough when its time for voting season, because their chances of ever getting their voice heard are slim to nothing. In the second source; paragraph thirteen, the Office of the Federal Register mentioned that candidates spend their time on "swing" states due to them having a better chance of suceeding there than, "non-swing" states. This is unfair to the citizens of those states not being able to get a word in, let alone a simple acknowledgement of who they may be voting for. Even in the third source; twentieth paragraph, the 'OotFR' mention that only those few lucky states chosen will receive more information on the candidates than those unfortunate few who were discarded like an old newspaper.

Votes are solely dependent on the electors of the states, as shown in paragraph ten of source two. Voter often get confused over who they are placing their votes towards,often voting for the wrong candidate or have no control, whatsoever. In the following paragraph, John F. Kennedy was in trouble back in 1960 because of the LA state legislature nearly got new electors so that most of Kennedy's popular vote would not be received at all. Overall the electors play crucial part in the Electoral College, but must could not trusted to hold that much responsibilty.

All-in-all, the Electoral College contains  some flaws, which is normal. I'm not asking for you to abolish it altogether, but compromise and evenly distribute the power of the votes and who gets a say on what is happening.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
