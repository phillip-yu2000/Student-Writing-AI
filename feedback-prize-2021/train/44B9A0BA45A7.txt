Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I honestly think that the change in the schools policy would be good for us students. I know a lot of the boys and girls here at SCHOOL_NAME love sports, and when they cant play because they have a sixty-nine they are pretty much heartbroken. So they decide to pass with barley is seventy, I think this isn't very good, that means that all the baseball players, football players, volleyball players and etcetera are only doing barley enough to pass there classes with seventy.

So, if you decided to change the school policy to where you couldn't be in sports, or any other clubs unless you have an eighty or higher, I think this will push the students to have way better grades then they do right now, here at Sun Ridge I know a lot of my fellow students love being in sports. That group of students that love being in sports includes me. I participate in cheer leading, volleyball, and soccer. So, since I know what is to be worried about your grades because you want to play I know that for a fact I would want to play and I'm not going to let and seventy stop me, so I would be pushed to get my grades higher and work hard in class.

In the long run, when we're applying for college and they see good grades on our record, we are going to gain from it. Sure, it's going to hard work and time, but we will benefit from it. Not only because colleges will see that we had good grades, but we got to play, represent our team. It also makes us hard workers, so we wont settle for less when we could do way better then getting seventies. So yes, I am totally for the change in the schools policy. It will do us good.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
