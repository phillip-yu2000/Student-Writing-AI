some school offer distance learning as an option from students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. and my opinion the student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home; the student have more freedom of concentrate in the home, student have problem for go to the school or the is student is sick of a illness and have more responsibility in the school or classes, home and job.

First, the student have more freedom of concentrate in the home that school because student not have noisy peoples, student work more quickly and have interests in the class. The corporation a student of regular school and home student, in the regular school have lass time in the class and home have more time and focus in the class.

Second, some student cannot go to the school for problem in the health or is sick of a illness. Today al the peoples can student and learn for class online or video conferencing, student with problem can learn and study like other student from regular school.

Finally, other people have responsibility in the class like the job because some not have time for go to the school and work all the day and only have time after work in the night. The person can study all the night for online or video conferencing. The principal parts of the online is you can study any day or time.

in conclusion the student can take class for online or video conferencing in the home because today the technology have a good benefit in the peoples. student can study and learn in the home in any moment or day, have more concentration, focus, responsibility and the person have problem of health can study and learn of your home.
