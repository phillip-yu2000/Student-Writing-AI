Dear Principal;

I think Policy 1 is the better one out of the two because communication in school is important.

Telling people about relationships is always a big deal in school. So instead of the class being the place for talk, why not free time or lunch. It would cut the chatter during class and would let teachers get out the information to the whole class without any distractions.

Since lots of people have the same classes they can tell their friends what is happening in that class, so they can be ready for it. Also to tell them about projects or tests that are happening in that class.

Sports are another big thing that require communication. Not just to fellow teammates but to parents as well. Say if a practice is cancelled or a game gets moved up a day early how will you be able to contact your parents. Emails may not get read until the next day, and if all the team calls on the office or nurse's phone then that will interrupt class time. Instead of all that chaos they can just call their parents on their phones or send them a text.

So if you haven't been able to figure it out yet, Policy 1 is a much better choice than Policy 2. Also the students will be happier with the principal for allowing them to use their phones at all.

Sincerely,
