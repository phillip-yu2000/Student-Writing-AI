"Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions (Nick D'Alto)." Having the technology to read student emotions in class is not valuable because it would cost a fortune and it would be a distraction.

The software to detect the emotions of students would be too expensive and that makes the Facial Action Coding System not valuable. "Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile (Nick D'Alto)." Most schools have standard home computers in class, which means the school will spend a fortune to replace the old computers with new and more powerful computers. After replacing the computers schools will still have to buy the Facial Action Coding System, which will most like cost alot of money that could be used for other things.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable is because it would be a distraction in a classroom. "Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions (Nick D'Alto)." After being told one student's emotion the other students in that class will unconsciously feel that emotion and distracting them for their lesson.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in schools because it is a distraction and it would cost a fortune to install. There is no need for a computer to tell a student's emotion in class.
