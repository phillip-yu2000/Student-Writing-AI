"The Challenge of Exploring Venus." The author thinks that Venus is a worth pursuite despite all of the dangours things that can happen and have had happen. In my own persnal opinion I think it is a horrific idea. Why send people to an unfirmilar plaent when a tiny space craft cant survive. I think even with ihs evdince its a horrinle idea.

In the artical

"The Challenge of Exploring Venus.", the author suporrts his idea of

"Venus is a worth pursuite despite all of the dangours". with facts. In the artical it states "Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this could-draped world. Each pervious mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." Why would someone want to explore a planet that not even a space craft can handel? He also states "NASA's possible spulution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float aboove the fray." This is one of the most pathetic pices ideas i have ever heard us. Why send someone where the weather is so harmful it can destroy a robot?

In conclousion I dont think that the author has a valid reason to send human's, his own kind, to a plaent that can kill them witin secinds of being there. He did nothing but support his idea with facts about how dangrous this plaent is to humans. He is living on the edge, it seems as if he does not care that peoples lives will be in extream danger on that planet. With the facts and evdince that i have gathered i think that the author did very porly trying to suppor his idea.
