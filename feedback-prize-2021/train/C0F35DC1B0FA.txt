I think the idea of being able to see other kids emotions or feelings from a computer is a bad idea. No one should know what the kid is going through unless that kid wants you to know he or she will tell you.

If the kid wants it to be private or can't tell anyone anything then they don't want others to know at all. If they are mad they shouldn't take it out on someone else. They could maybe ask a close friend or teacher or parent for help or ask them what they should do. He or she could be going through a lot at home or with grades or a bully that makes he or she mad. Parents need to ask there kids and wonder are they doing ok in school is everything alright if there kid is showing emotions for being mad or sad then they should be concerned. Most kids will be to scared to tell others cause they think they will get into trouble so they just stay quiet. Some kids take the pain out on there selfs and harm there selfs or worse. The kid shouldn't be asking what to do cause they are to scared. The guardian, teacher, friend or someone close should be asking them are you ok or im here for you then the kid will speak up and talk.

My opion on whether the computer should read kids expressions is no that's the parents job or guardian computers don't run are life's and the guardian should know if there kid is doing ok or not and help them instead of a computer helping them on there life situations.
