Dear principal,

i think that changing the school policy is not a very good idea. Most kids have a C or higher, but just because they don't have the grade required, doesn't mean they cant participate in sports. Many kids don't do very well in school, but sometimes they do sports to get their mind off of things. Some kids are very fanatic about sports, and that's what they like doing. Maybe they even want to have a future that has to do with sports. But not letting them do what they like , just because of not having a B or higher, is not a good solution . And if they do a test , and she/he didn't do well, they just lost their ability to do what they like. Some kids think that sports is their life, and that is the only thing that matters to them.

Another reason why you should let kids participate even though they don't have a B or higher is, that the United States is one of the country's that has they most obesity in the world. And some of the kids need that exercise to try to maintain fit. and just because they don't have the accurate grade for it, is not a good idea. So i hope you will change your mind, by the ideas that i have given you. And try to think thoroughly of the decision your about to make.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
