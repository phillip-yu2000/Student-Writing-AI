To Whom It May Concern:

I think it was right of you to raise the average for being able to play sports and be part of other after school activities to a B average from a C average. There are so many kids in our school who are struggling and practically failing, yet they still get to play sports. Whether it's their family life, lack of interest, or the sport itself that messes with these kids schedules, I know you did a good thing. Kids who strive to do good in school are well respected and get a lot out of the knowledge they get by paying attention and if we just continue to let sports players have a C average, they'll never improve their grades. By raising the average to a B, you have set a standard that they must reach. If they love the sport as much as they think they do, they're going to try and try to improve test scores, turn homework in on time, and pay attention in classes. They will do much better now, if they truly want to play sports.

Thank you for your time,

A Satisfied Student.
