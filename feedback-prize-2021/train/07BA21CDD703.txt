It is not worthy pursuit while it has the dangers it present. here is "in my opinion" the most dangerous things that venus has to offer.

The first danger on the planet is the atmosphere. It says that almost 97 percent of the atmosphere that blankets venus is carbon dioxide. since venus has more carbon dioxide then oxygen, you would die from the lack of oxygen.

the second danger on the planet is gravity. we can sustain the gravity on earth, but trying to sustain gravity that is 90 time greater than trying to get on venus would be extremely difficlut.

the third danger the planet has to offer is heat. if the tempature is 800 degrees fahrenheit, i would profer to go on a hot, sunny day on earth rather then having a normal day on venus. i don't think that have air conditioners would help the fact that you would be cooked alive on venus.

they're my three of the dangers that venus has to offer. if we have to examine venus, i am leaving.
