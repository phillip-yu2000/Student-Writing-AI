Nowadays a lot of people want advice so they can make the right choice or do it better but is asking two or more people a better option? What is advice? Advice helping someone do something better if their doing something wrong or if their going threw a rough time you give them advice. But is it good to get more than 1 person to give you advice? I think that you should ask more than one person for advice if it is really important to you and if you ask more than one person they could give you similar advice , afterwords you could compare both of the advises and make it into one that is very good. Giving advice to someone could change their lives, it can save their life, it can make them successful

How can it change someones life? If they are in a bad place right now you can give them good advice by telling them whats good for them and whats bad them. Like if it was a homeless person that livesÂ in the streets and was intoxicated all the time you could help them by giving them good advice so they can move out of that stage of being in the streets. You could help them make better choices in their life and if they made more friends they could get more advice from other people. Another way it can change someones life is by giving them advice for their health or on how to be successful with a business. But advice can make someone really smart it.

How to get advice

To get advice the first person you should always ask a trusted parent because they been through a lot already so they have experienced a lot in life. If you dont trust them you should talk to one of your good friends that you trust a lot and that you tell your secrets to. And if you dont trust them go to your counselor. They will help you no matter what they are always there for you no matter what.
