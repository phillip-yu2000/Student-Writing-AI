Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think policy one is the best policy because kids are allowed to bring other stuff to school. kids walk home and parents usually want kids to have there cell phones just in case of an emergency. I think if you chooses the second policy there would be a big problem with parents and kids. If a teacher see' s or hear' s a cell phone during class then take it away and give it to the office just like normal.

I think most people would choose policy one because it seems like a better policy to have. If you choose policy two there would be a problem with kids bringing phones to school anyway. I don't think anybody would pay attention to your rules and policy's, kids would still bring cell phones to school. I don't think very many kids text in class, and if they do i still think they are getting their work done. To me cell phones aren't a big deal in schools. so i think we should just keep it how it is, and not have to worry about it anymore. Policy number one is a better policy then policy two.

Policy number one is a better policy because a lot of kids walk home after school and if something bad happens and they don't have their cell phone it would not be good so its better if we don't take that chance. Some kids go home with another friend after school, the parents usually want the kid to have there cell phone with them just in case there's a change in plan, or kid needs picked up. Its a good thing to keep your phone with you. Another reason why policy 1 is the better policy is because most kids have sports after school. After a sport they might need to call someone to come pick them up or call someone for any other reason. Its a dumb idea to have to keeps phones at home, when we need them with us. thank you.
