Dear Principle,

I find that the rule which only allows students to participate in sports or other various school activities is unjust. This is for many reason, the first of which is that sometimes students are incapable of acquiring the grades needed to participate in such activities. Some students may simply be lazy, but others may very well indeed lack the sufficient mental capabilities to obtain the grades required. That is not to say that they are stupid or otherwise impaired, but that they might be slower learners and so therefore have not caught up with the rest of their classmates.

That being said, it would be unfair to restrict them from these activities, since academics and physical education are totally different matters. Just because someone plays sports, it does not necessarily give them a more difficult time in school. Actually, it may assist them, since exercise stimulates brain activity and releases endorphins into the blood stream. Studies have shown that endorphins energize and focus people, which may help in class.

Hopefully these reasons are enough to convince you that preventing the students with lower grades from exercise is somewhat unjustified.

Cordially,
