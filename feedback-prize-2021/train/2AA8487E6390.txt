Hello my name is Luke. You might have heard of me but if you don't i'm a Seagoing Cowboy from the UNRRA (the United Nation Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).I do things like take care of younge cows,horses,and mules over the water. The UNRRA has been low on Seagoing Cowboys and we need help. I

would like for you and other people to apply for the job. You need to be at least 16,or graduating from high school "like me"or older. And when you are 18 you will be able to draft for military survice.

If you are wondering there is nothing to be afraid of be of we ride on big boats like the SS Charles W. Wooster There are flaws to this job too,because when I crossed the Atlantic Ocean it took us two weeks. The lucky thing about being on a ship for that long is that I had my friends onbord and I was having a good time. And a good thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you know you are helping others because of the destruction of World War 2. So if you need a job that would be fun and one you would like become a Seagoing Cowboy.
