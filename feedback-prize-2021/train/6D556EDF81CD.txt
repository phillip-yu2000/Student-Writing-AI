The elections should be changed by popular vote for president of the United States of America.

The votes from the people are not directly going towards the candidate they choose. The United States of America offers the right to vote for the president, yet in the end your vote does not go directly toward the candidate of your choice. The Electoral College process is the selection of electors. You help choose your states electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The electors are the ones who really elect the candidate's.

Each party selects a slate of elector's trusted to vote for the party's nominee. The electors rarely betray the trust of the party's. Although it has happened in 2000 with Gore having more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes. That was the first time since 1888.

Although there are not much betrayels the Electoral College is not very trust worthy.  Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing with elector that would not be faithful and would oppose John F. Kennedy. The popular votes ment for Kennedy wouldn't actually be for him.

The Electoral College is outdated and could get votes confuse by the electors which would cause them to vote for th wrong candidate.

The popular votes would also encourage more people to pay attention to the campain. The people in some states don't pay much attention because they know that their votes will probably not have much effect as if in a popular vote.

The Electoral College is outdated unfair and irrational. If the people of the United States of America have the right to vote, their vote should go directly towards the nomine they choose. The popular vote could have a great effect on the campaigns. Why not allow the people to directly vote for the candidate of their choice instead of taking a chance with the electors that could be unfaithful.
