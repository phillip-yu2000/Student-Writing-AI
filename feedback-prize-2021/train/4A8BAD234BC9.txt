Drivers should not be able to text and drive because it is very dangerous. Statistics show that 1 out of 4 crashes in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving. Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes while talking or texting on a cell phone. Texting and driving is dangerous for everybody no matter the age or experience of the person behind the wheel.

Cell phone distractions are very appalling. The amount of people texting and driving a day is quite alarming; approximately 660,000 people are using their phone while driving. Which means those people are spending more attention to their phones than the road which as a result equals more accidents. Answering a text takes your attention for about 5 seconds. While going 55 mph that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.

Texting and driving is just dangerous in general not only for the driver but also the passengers in the car and surrounding cars as well and statistics show that. The phone can wait and that text message can wait, it's not worth putting your life at risk.
