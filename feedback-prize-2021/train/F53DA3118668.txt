Why students need to do their activities unless it a C average? Still a C average is passing but why they can't participate sports or other activities? Why you do change the idea to their goal of a C average for doing sports or other activities? If they get a D average on their grade they can't participate on something. If they study hard and get an A ,B, or C average they could participate. That is my idea of the average goals to keep participate on activities. It would make our school win and have fun together. I hope you agree this idea and let them, the C average students, participate.

Some of the other school policy does participate on activities at the C average and they study hard to get an A or B average so that's the fact about it. Think about it for making the school fun and happy the students agree of the idea and you will too. Help our school to be the best school ever!
