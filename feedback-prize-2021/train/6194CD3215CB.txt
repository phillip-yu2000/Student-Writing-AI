It might be valuable, because it would be easy to see if a student is bored or confused. That might help around the class a bit, especially if a student lies if they know a certain subject everyone just learned, but that certain student either didn't pay attention because they were bored, or they were just confused about the subject. With this technology, you can help them out and maybe it would be efficient.

In the article it says, "You can use the technology to see if a student is bored or confused." Since that was said, I think it would be a good idea to use that in a classroom. Like I said in my claim, a student might be lying, so using this technology might help out you and your student.

In conclusion,the technology is helpful and can probably help out other people too, not just students. People can lie about their mood and can feel down, but if you use this technology, you might see that something is wrong with the person because of how they feel, and you might be able to help them out. This technology is helping the world become a better world.
