Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion being needed, I don't understand why students here should have to have a grade B average. Playing sports isn't really needing to have to be one a certain grade level, it's all about your fitness and how well you play for your school.

If I were a principal I wouldn't make people have good grades as they make you have now because it really isn't about how well your grades are it truly is all about your achievment. Playing sports isn't really ever on how well you do in your classes anywho because it's a sport, you play it as a team, and if you aren't that good you do it to gain fitness and become tougher. I could sort of see why you have to have good grades thought just because whenever you're playing a sport it's with a school team, so therefor you have to be a good role model for your teamates rather then getting in trouble all the time and failing every single class. If you're a good player, then act and show as if you are one. If you aren't one, then try your best to show that you can do it!

I have always wondered why the "policy" has to be set on whether or not you're making a B average. In my opinion again I do not believe why this has to be this way, I could understand if you were failing because that's just not really exceptiable in my book. Other then not failing I believe you should be aloud to play because the only way I would ever say no is because of a failing F. That just gives not effort. If you passed without any F's then you should be able to play a sport because you still gave effort in what you were doing.
