What do you do for fun? Sports,student council, or FFA are all examples of fun extracurricular activities to do at school. You should always try to do an extra activity. Therefore I agree that students should engage in extracurricular activities because it teaches then responsibility, time management, and it is fun and benifitail to do.

First off doing something other than just school can teach kids responsibility and time management.

Doing a sport for example. To do this you would be completing school work and the sports work,so you would have to be able to complete school work on time then focus on the sport you're playing. The way to do all of that is to manage your time with school and activities to do all of your school work and keep your grades up. Doing a extra activity requires responsabilliy and dedicating time.

Secondly extracurricular can be fun and healthy for kids. You never know what doors will open for you by taking a chance. By playing a sport could take you in to a profetinalÂ league. By joining school council could take you in to politics. You just never know what opportunities will come your way by doing something new. finding opportunities can be fun and uplifting. over all doing a extracurricular make you a more well rounded person.

In conclusion kids should do extracurricular activities because It teaches responsibility, time management and it is healthy and beneficial to young adults. Get out there and try something new.
