Grade Change

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should change the policy from having to have an B average to play sports. Most of the kids that play sports have an C average. Well most of the students in the school have an C average. You should change it to C average because maybe they had all A' s and one C that was an eighty four. They was one point away from having an B now they can't play spots because of that one point. I also think you should change it to an C because C is the average persons grade. Most people have an hard time learning things and keeping up with sports so they might make an C on their report card, but an C isn't an bad grade it might not be an A or B but its not bad. I think if you change it we want have anyone participating in sports. Then other schools are going to look at our school like we are boring and be like "I don't want to go there because they are lame." We don't want that we want people to look at our school and say "They have an good athletic field I want to try that school out." We don't want them looking at the school as an loser school or boring

, do we ? What if an parent(s) want to see their kids play but they made an C so they got kicked off the team. The parent(s) are going to be mad that they paid all that money and their child has got kicked off the team. We want to work with the parent(s) not make them mad or angry. That's what's going to happen if you change the average to B. We're going to have a lot of angry parent(s) coming to the school. We don't want an angry mob surrounding the school because their child had got kicked off their favorite sport team. So you should keep it at an C average to make parents, students, outsiders looking in and teachers happy. We don't want the students in class talking about "We would of won if i had of played." Then they wouldn't be thinking about school. So you think about that and thank you for taking time out your day to read this letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
