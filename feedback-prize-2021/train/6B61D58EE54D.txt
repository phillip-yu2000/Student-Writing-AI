Have you ever wondered if the face on Mars was actually real?

Many people think it is real and some don't.

A Viking 1 photo of this mysterious face on Mars shows a picture of a face on this red planet.

It seems real but it is actually shadows from a huge rock formation.

These shadows give you illusions of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

Some people might think the face on Mars is real but it isn't.

It is a natural landform that has a shadow revealing a human face.

NASA revealed an image showing a "huge rock formation that resembles a human head that was formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth." The picture of the face on Mars plays tricks on your mind because you think it is real when it really isn't.

It is an illusion that makes you believe it is a face when it is only a natural landform.

On April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured some pictures of this mysterious face on a cloudless summer day.

Since no clouds were around when the crew took pictures, sure enough the face was just a landform.

Usually this landform would cast a shadow resembling a face but no clouds were in the area for this to happen.

Thousands of web surfers wanted to know if the face was real or not and then the "image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform." The face on Mars was thought to be real but these pictures provided enough evidence that the face was a natural landform.

At first, many people thought the face on Mars was real because it was in films, magazines, and radio talk shows.

This huge sensation about the face on Mars was shortlived because scientists soon figured out that it was just a landform.

When you see the picture of the face, it looks real because of the shadow reflected off of the landform.

It is only an illusion that is tempting to believe.

This is why I believe the face is a natural landform.
