Schools require summer projects to benefit your learning outside of school. I think that sudents would be more engaged, creative, and interested in topics that they can decide.

Students should be able to design their own projects to be more engaged in the topics. Depending on the class, they would be able to relate something they enjoy, or are passionate about, to learn more about the school project topic. For example, if you have a summer english project for a book report, students could choose a book that they're interested in,and enjoy reading, instead of something they're not interested in, students would be more engaged and creative about the project because of their book choice.

Students would benefit from the freedom of designing their topics, because if they're interested in the topic they chose, their grades might improve because of their engagement to the topic. Students would be able to relate what they're learning about their chosen topic, into a much more creative way to express themselves. If you're able to decide the format of your own project, for example, you could create art, a book, or use the internet to create something that you're passionate about. Instead of having set boundaries by teachers, you could have more freedom to design, and express yourself through your topic.

Students should have the freedom of designing their summer projects, students would be able to learn more about their topic of interest, be more engaged, and be able to get creative about their format of the project. Students should be able to do projects that interest them, and benefit their learning better, instead of teacher-designed projects that have strict boundaires, and have to be in correct format for the assigned project.Â
