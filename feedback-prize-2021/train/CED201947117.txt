There are many landforms that look like things or faces or animals. There is one on Mars that is assumed to be made by aliens but, it is not. It is just a rock formation just like any other. If it is there is no evidence that is is made by aliens or some creatures. Here is some more information that it is not a alien made face but, just a bunch of rocks.

Many people think that the face on Mars is made by someone other than us. But, I am here to prove that wrong . There are many faces that look like that all over the world and made even on other planets that we don't know about. I'm not saying that it wasnt made from aliens but, it most likely wasn't it was probably just erosion or something of that nature. They searched all over Mars to find if there was but, there wasn't any. NASA wouldn't hide something like this, they would show it to everybody. It would make headlines saying that their is some kind of life form on Mars. But, there is no life form on Mars as of today. They have gotten pictures of it from very close range and found out it just looked like that from a far distance away in pictures. The pictures from far distance do look like a face but all it is, is just rocks. It is just a illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth in a huge rock formation.

This is why we think that it is just a rock formation and nothing more than that. They have many of things to find out that all of it is rock put together to make the illusion of a face. But, it was not made by aliens or anything like that it is just rocks. It has been proven from tons and tons of pictures from many different type of camera from different heights and many different ways to find out it is all rocks. They wouldn't keep it from us if their was something on Mars. If they did, something would get out that their is life on Mars but, their is not.
