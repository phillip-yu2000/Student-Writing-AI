The driverless car could solve so many problems that we all encounter daily on the road. For example, driverless cars can solve the issue of speeding. Since there is a computer controlling the car it will always drive the speed limit, saving people money and lives. Also, a computer will never get tired so there is no worrries of falling asleep at the wheel which can also help prevent many late-night accidents. Lastly, driverless cars can help prevent the growing epidemic of texting and driving, as will as drunk driving.

With driverless cars taking over the road, this can help keep everyone safe on the road and prevent thousands of accidents. With a computer controlling the car that knows everything there is to know about driving safely, this can help insure one's safety while traveling via car. Of course there will be situaions that a human driver is more skilled than the computer, such as when there is heavy traffic and/or weather conditions. With time and a better understanding, the driverless cars will learn to adapt to these situations.

Though it may take some time for everyone to adapt to the change of being a full time passenger in the car, while a computer drives, it will all work out for the better. In the long run these cars will help protect people all over and make the roads a much safer place. Love driverless cars or hate them we are heading towards them and they are here to stay.
