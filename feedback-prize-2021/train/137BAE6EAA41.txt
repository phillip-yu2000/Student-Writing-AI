Dear Principal,

Have you seen the streets and the beaches of San Diego? Students helping around the community is needed. The streets and beach have been filled with litter. If students help around the community, it will show an example to the adults. Not only students need to co-operate but also adults. If we all help, the community will be recognized. It will not be fair that only certain amount of students help. The whole school needs to help with something.

Are you interested in volunteering? I would make sure to tell all of my friends to come. I would also tell friends who are not in this school to come. We, as a school, need to take a stand. We also need to show to other school how it is done. Even if we might get tiered we are showing an example to all schools, and families, so that next year more people will come. We can also make a club in the school that we dedicate a weekend per month to go to the beach and clean. After cleaning we can go in the water and have fun. It is all about volunteering and participating. Very little people and schools do this. If we litter the streets and beaches who is going to clean them up? Some trash might go to the ocean. If trash goes into the ocean, it can harm the animals. If we cleanup San Diego, it will be an example for other cities in the United States to do the same.

There are very few schools who do this. Cleaning the beaches and the streets is equivalent to helping the community.

At the end, cleaning up would be important in the community.

To conclude this letter to you principal, I agree in making a club and cleaning the streets and beaches of San Diego. If our school takes a stand, the whole community will take a stand. This is all about putting an example to the whole country. In the future, the United States would be an example to the entire world.

Finally, I agree to make a club and help clean the streets and beaches of San Diego.

Sincerely,
