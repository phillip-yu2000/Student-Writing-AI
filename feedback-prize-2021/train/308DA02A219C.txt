Dear Principal,

I believe that you should allow kids to use their cell phones during lunch and free times. This would make it so that kids are less tempted to use their phones during classes because they no longer have a reason to. For example, children won't text their friends while pretending to read, as shown in the video. To make sure that the cell phones are turned off before returning to class you could have a check done before leaving lunch and free periods by the school staff. Also, many times students rely on school to see their friends and if you aren't in any of their classes these cell phone times allow you to talk with them. Having a cell phone is very important to some kids as well as parents. Many parents feel safer knowing that if they need anything or get into trouble they can just call or text them. Another reason cell phones should be allowed is that kids will have more flexibility with after school programs. They will be able to call their parents to see if they can attend things like clubs and sports games which increases school spirit. Although many people would say that the children would just continue their lunchtime conversations during class and break the rules, I believe that kids are more responsible. However, if any student does disrespect the rules that you have laid out then they couch in terms get and after school detention or a small punishment. Punishments can continuously get worse every time they do it. If you don't have trust in the students at your school, then they will never be happy. In a school environment being happy is very important because it is easier to concentrate on work. Feeling like you have a little amount of power is better than thinking the school controls everything you do. Allowing kids to have phones in school gives them that power.

Sincerely,
