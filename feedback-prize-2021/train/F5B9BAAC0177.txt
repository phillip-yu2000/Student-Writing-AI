My position is that self-driving cars should be manufactured and eventually should be sold to the general public. The cars wouldn't fix all of the problems that come along with cas accidents and problems but it can help reduce them.

The reason why self-driving cars should be manufactured is because it can stop ,or help prevent less accidents from happening. If theres less people in the car, then there are less people to get hurt ,and if the car is driving it going to be safe to have the car drive its self because its programed to make the best decision to keep the passenger others safe. BMW is making a car with a in-car safety feature to reduce the use of cellphones being used while behind the wheel. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have all allowed limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Companies and people wouldn't want to make or buy the cars if they weren't proven to be as safe as possible. It also said in paragraph 5, that they have cars that auto lock the breaks to make it safer. Self driving cars could also reduce the percentage of DUI related car accidents, and deaths by having the car drive for you instead of anyone risking getting put in jail or getting pulled over. Paragraph 4 also says that the cars will have a lot of sensors on them to detect any obstacles and for the car to be aware of its surroundings at all times.

In conclusion I think that self-driving cars should be made because they can help better the world and the future ahead by reducing the percentage of accidents, and problems that human drivers put themselves at risk to.
