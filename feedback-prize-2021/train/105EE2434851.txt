I think that driveless cars would be alot more convenint if you dont feel like driving or if you just want to be lazy, but way to much stress. what if your an elder and you have no clue how to work the car. I feel the more we keep upgrading to electronics the easier it is for something to go wrong. You never truely know when or if your vehicle could malfunction. What if your on the auto ban and your going 120mph and your vehivle just stops? if you are going about 120mph then other people are going 120mph if not more. you could get rear ended and going as fast as 120mph that would defintely kill you.

Everyone only thinks of the idea of having a driveless car like "oh my that has to be so cool and awedome i wont even have to do anything". wrong you still have to pay attention and be there for when roads are getting worked on so you can navigate your way through it. the even tell us in the passage "they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out if driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating theough roadwork or accidents" there not all as great as what people make them out to be.

If we stick to the basic do it your self then we know we can control it beacause we would feel comfortable and we would know the basics. Maybe im wrong maybe it would work and be more simple for people, But think about would you ever truely trust a car that can drive it's self?
