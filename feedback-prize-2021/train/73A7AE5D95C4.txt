Many people may think that the face on mars was created by aliens but, they are wrong. The face on mars is just a natural landform. In paragraph 12 it states that what the picture shows is actually the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform, common around the American West, this statement is basically saying that there are many landforms that can look like faces or any type of other iiregular feature.

In paragraph 7,

it explains how Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a much better picture than the origianal Viking photo. When Michael Malin and his camera team snapped the photo it revealed a natural landform, giving proof that there was no alien moument at all. And with that being done, it gives us even better reason to believe that it is just the way the ground looks.

The last two paragraphs in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" are most likely indicating that things can look different up close and also, from a distance. As I said in paragraph 1, paragraph 12 even states that landforms like that are common around the American West Meaning, that there could be a landform anywhere that looks like an alien, a martian or even an egyptian god!
