Have you ever wanted a better view of a situation that you have just been tasked with too complete. Then you should try asking multiple people for their view on the situation don't believe me i might just change your mind. Now you wouldn't want to go in blind and get smashed with a metaphorical boat load of work because you didnt ask people what was going on or what was happening because you were uninformed.

One example would be going to a new restaurant that is new in town were the service is OK but not the best and the food is horrid all because you didnt check the reviews. You could have avoided wasting your time by just checking the reviews and taking other peoples opinion on the restaurant but you didnt and now you see the importance of others opinions. also another example would be advisers such as school advisers or presidential advisers they both have the same job and that is to give you their opinion.

Now you might be wondering well how will this change the outcome of anything let me tell you that it can change the way you think and also your view of the situation. Also the way it can change your view is almost like chess you have to be thinking like the opponent to understand what they are going to do next and also from their point of view were they can see something you can not see. Another example would be buying something like a game or a movie you want to get your moneys worth so you ask for peoples opinions to see witch one is better.

Everyone makes choices some big some small and some that are so big that you cant decide all by your self and you want to have the best possible outcome you can possibly get. and that is why you should always take other peoples opinions into account because no matter how much you care in the end they will all matter.
