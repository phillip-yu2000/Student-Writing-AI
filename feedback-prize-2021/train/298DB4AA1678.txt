As a u. s citizen that we should get rid of the ellectoral college. I think that it should be the peoples desision of who should run the countrys main power. Being the president is the biggest job in america so i think it should be up to the people that will have to obide by his rules and follow his laws. It would not be fair if all the higher richer people get to decide cause they can all decide the one in their favor thats helps them out the most and all lower class people would be screwed. Some may think that the Electoral college is a better choice because their is different benifits about the electors voting instead of americas people. Like for instance when their are ties the ellectoral college is a huge help.

The popular vote is the best way to do it as long as the restrictions are being followed ,like no voting til you are 18 years of age and no fellonies policy. These rules can be very important to the elections concidering that would get rid of millions of extra votes. In the electoral college one thing i do not like is the fact each state has a different number of electoral votes. that would favor one state more than another rather than them all having an equal amount so the voting could be more justified and fair.
