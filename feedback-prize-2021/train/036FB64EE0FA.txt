This face is not a creation of aliens. It is a natural landform. You can tell this is a natural landform because in the story it says that the caption noted a "huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." That is saying that it only looks like a face because of the shadows.

It says that "as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." So that means that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" This is saying that if it was a creation of aliens you would be able to tell. In conclusion the Face is not a creation of aliens it is a natural landform. There was no evidence showing that an alien of some kind created this Face. It was clearly the shadows making it look like a Face.
