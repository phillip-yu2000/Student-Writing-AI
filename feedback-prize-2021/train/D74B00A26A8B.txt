Driverless cars in the future would be fantastic. I believe they will help alot of people out. Companies are even making computer-driven cars all ready. This cars would probably sell very fast and easy. They will make a big inpact on humans in the future. Anyway why would anyone want a driverless car?

There's many different reason why humans would want this car

I think they would want a driverless car because you wouldn't have to drive your self. Especially if your tired and been busy all day. There would be great equitment in the car for them to use when in the car. The sensors will help them out too. The driverless car will also have a video camera,a GPS recevier and an inertial motion sensor. People would love all that stuff in their car. This driverless car would change driving for ever.

That why i'm agreeing with driverless cars. This would be a perfect invention in the future. Everyone would love this care very much. I just think it would help out a lot of people who's busy and works alot. This would change how car aceidents happen and more. This is why i thing anyone would want a driverless car.
