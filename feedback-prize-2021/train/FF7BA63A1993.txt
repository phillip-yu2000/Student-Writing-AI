The Face on Mars is a natural landform. A few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took pictures and revealed that the Face was only a natural landform. They also saw that there was no alien monument. Michael and his team said that if it was an ancient civilization, there would've been planes on the ground, Egytian-style pyramids, or small shacks.

NASA revealed the image and they said that it was a huge rock formation formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose, and a mouth. The Face was only an illusion. NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft revealed that it is a mesa. Michael proved that it was a mesa because what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mesa or butte. These are most common around the American West.

This natural landform is similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The landform in Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Middle Butte is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This proves that the Face on Mars is just a landform.
