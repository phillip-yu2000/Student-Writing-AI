Dear Principal,

"RING!!" STUDENT_NAME picked up her cell phone as the disrupted the class in the middle of a very influential lesson. It was a forward message that someone had sent to her. In the picture was the most embarrassing thing that she has ever witnessed before. It was a picture of her drooling on the desk during first block. Everyone laughed throughout the school day as they have received her picture on the forward message.

This is an example of what goes on at a school filled with cell phones and other electronic items. Cell phones should not be allowed at school. Some of the reasons why are, they are disturbing, they start a lot of drama, and they stop students from finishing or even doing their work at all.

First of all, cell phones are a way of connecting to others for the use of socialization. Some students use them in a negative way. Students may be sending inappropriate messages at school to others. It is also a way to bully other students and start drama. Many students plan to skip or do things they aren't supposed to do. Cell phones can even be used to cheat on tests.

Next, cell phones disturb the class from doing their work. If a cell phone rings in class, it will catch other people's attention, including your own. The noise will take your mind away from your school work and lessons that were just taught to you.

Last but not least, If a student is texting in class, they are not doing their school work. You cant do two things at once. Cell phones make students pay attention to the wrong thing. They are very disturbing and should not be allowed at school. It can cause student to fail tests and get bad grades on their class assignments. Although some students may be able to contain a phone in school and be quite respectful, not all students are the same. This is why I think you shouldn't acknowledge us to bring our cell phones on campus at all.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
