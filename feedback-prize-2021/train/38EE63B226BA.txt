Dear, Principal

As a student at this school I understand that their have been problems at school involving cell phones and you are interested in changing the policy on cell phone use during the hours of school.

I have looked at each policy and I believe that it is a better option to go with the first policy to allow the students to bring phones to school and let them use them during lunch and other free times.

The reason that I think this plan will work better, is because sometimes students need to call their parents to tell them things and that would not take away from the education that the student receives since it would be on the student's own free time and not in class.

I also believe that the second policy to not let students have cell phones at school could put a student in danger if he or she needed to call for help.

I hope this letter helped you by giving you a look at how the students feel about the two new policies that you are considering changing to.
