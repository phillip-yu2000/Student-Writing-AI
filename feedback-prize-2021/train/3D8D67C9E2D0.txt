dear,principal i don't think that you should make this a school policy because many students don't make the average of b or c that's why it would be hard for them to be able to play sports and they wouldent be able to play sports so it would make a lot of people unhappy expecially the people that that love sports i don't think that i could make a b or c average in my classes and if i couldent keep a b or c average then i wouldentbe able to play sports and then my perents would get mad cause their kids cant play sports at the school without having a b or c average in their classes and their parents would not come to games so we would loose our audience and crowd and then who would cheer the team on ? and parents would get mad and possibly remove their child from the school and that would put the school loosing students and that wouldent be a good thing and thinfs wouls keep messing up from there and i love playing sports but math is a weakness for me and if i want to play sports but i cant is i don't have a b ot c average in all my classes and then i wouldent be able to play sports .

sincerely ,
