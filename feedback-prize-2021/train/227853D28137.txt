Dear principal,

I think it would be a great idea for the students at our school to be required to do some community service. It would be a chance for the students to help out in the community, and it would also help the community as well. It is also a way in which students can spend their time wisely.

First of all, the students would be doing a nice thing by helping out in the community. They can help keep the community clean, visit the elderly, or even help out people in their jobs. By this, the people in the community can get some help and the students can learn about people in their community, and their jobs. The students can also get some experience in their field of what they want to be when they grow up. Also, community service is needed to get into college, and the community service can also help a student get into college.

Secondly, it would be a good way for students to spend their time, and students can also learn to manage their time. Instead of staying at home, they can do something which can help other people, and they would also be getting something in return. Students can also learn how to manage their time with their daily schedules, and be able to complete tasks faster, and with good quality.

In my opinion, I think requiring the students at our school to perform community service is a really nice idea. It is a way for them to do something for the community, and it is really good for the students too.

Sincerely,

a student
