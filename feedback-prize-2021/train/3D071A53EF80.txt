Dear Principal

I think that it is right to have a B average to play a sport and other activities because if people start fail with a C

just cause they don't feel like working hard its not right to the other team mates if they are making A' s and B' s to be on the team and there trying very hard to have good grades and make sure they are on the team.

to be played and the games but if the they change the rules of the grades to a C' s it might not be a lot of people trying as hard to get a high grade cause they know they still will be on the team still If they keep it how it is people will try to get there grades up and be passing all they class getting the lesson that is giving to them and know how to work it out when that person see it again and there life time.
