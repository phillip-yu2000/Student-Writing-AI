The reason i think people should not bring phones to school is because they are a distraction. They keep you from doing your work, and that gets on the teachers nerves. Phone are meant to be keep on the outside of school, and you should never bring a phone to school. If i was the principal, i would tell every students that you shouldn't bring phones to school,

or your teacher will take them up. So do the world a favor, and don't bring your phone to school, or they will be in the teachers, or the principals office for the rest of the year. Your parent should never let you bring your phone to school, because if you do, then it will be your own fault. A lot of people don't bring there phone to school because they are well behaved people, and they would never break the rules. They will be good children, and never act like people that are not well behaved at school. That's why my mother wont let me bring my because i would no better. She tells me that she used to be at school, and children used to bring there phones to school, and they would always get them stolen. That is another reason why you should bring them to school neither. So keep your phone at school so they wont get taking up at school, or stolen at school. That is a good reason that you should never bring phones to school. My mama looks out for me because if it was somebody else phone, they would not want it to be stolen. She is a good mama looking out for me. So don't bring phones to school for our own safety.
