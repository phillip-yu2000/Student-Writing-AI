Most people around the age of 12 -

15 have trouble participating in extracurricular activities. Due to things like

they may not have time, there to busy playing on there games station at home or maybe just to lazy to even try. joining an active that you like can be fun and challenging to do. i'm PROPER_NAME and I wanted to talk about if students should participate in extracurricular activities.

participating in extracurricular activities can be a great way to help students get engaged with something

they love doing. playing sports or serving on student council can be mentally and pshicaly healthy. If a child were to play a sport it could help with there health because there being more active. For example soccer is a great sport for someone who loves to run.

Working on the yearbook or serving on the student council can challenge the brain as in learning how to solve problems and or taking on leadership. participating in activities

can be good for students social lives. instead of laying on their bed watching TV all day they could be hanging out with some friends after soccer practice. Now saying that this does not mean to put your kids into a sport or active that they do not want to be a part of.

Lets say you did put or child in a active that they didnt like that much. it wouldnt be as fun as it should be. your child may end up upset and quit.Do

ing an extra sport or playing chess can be a great thing for children. in conclusion students should participate in extracurricular activates.
