Dear principal,

Almost no one has a B average so i think its not fair that those who want to play outside sports can't i think it should be based on if there even trying at school not how their grade is. That's stripping kids of their right to do what the want with their lives what if some kids don't want to go home to their parents what if they had nothing else to do what would you think of that or would it be the same kids do what you think is right but might no be what you thought? One day kids will revolt over that and it might not be so pretty and innocent.

We're not as stupid as you think we just need a good influence to inspire us to do better and obviously if we haven't done it yet then we haven't found the right influence yet. I think what your doing to the sports issue at school is wrong and your opinion of it is invalid to me. But that might just be to me imp not sure about the other students but i think all of our opinions on this are close to the same and just as valid as vote for the president to me. That's what i think of your rule we need to have a B average to not participate in school sports and if more people think i' m wrong for doing so then enlighten me others wise.

Sincerely, Student

P.S we need a new lunch menu I mean change it up a bit its to predictable.
