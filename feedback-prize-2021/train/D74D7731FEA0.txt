Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that only children with an b average shouldn't be the only ones to participate in school activities. Because more students have a c average than a b average. Also if you only choose the ones with a b average most of them, aren't athletic so you want have any sport teams. Also we will have to forfit all the game we have and, we will all be sad. You should actually have either a vote or try outs for the sport.

If you do this then you will have a actual team for the year. You would probably have more people on the basketball team than , any other sport, because its the most liked than any other sport. I also think that everybody except people with an f average should be able to participate. Because the ones with an f average must play in class, or need extra help. This is why I don't think that only b averages get to participate in school activities.
