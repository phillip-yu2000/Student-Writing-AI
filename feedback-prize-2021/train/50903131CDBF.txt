The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a good thing. This makes learning easier for students and helps them comperhend better. There's 1 main reason why and that's because it helps you learn.

For students learning somehting new is always hard, but it's more hard when you dont have a teacher around to explain it for you. The article states "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr Huang predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". This basically shows you that whenever your not for sure about something changes will be made to help you understand what your better.

In conclusion my 1 main reason why is because it helps you learn. With teachers not being able to answer your question outside of school, having a computer that can help you based on you facial expression would benefit alot. Anyone can say they've learned somehting but your look says it all.
