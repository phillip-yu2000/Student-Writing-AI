I agree that we should give these car a chance to fundamentally change the world. My personal view of this is such a great idea. I strongly believe that these automakers would make the roads safer.

In this generation we have many people who like to text and drive or even snapchattng and drive .Why would we want teenager or even some adults to be on the road that aren't paying attention to their phones and the road ? Is that what we really want ? No we don't. With automakers the drivers would not have to worry about paying attention if they're driving right. Yeah maybe i see where their coming from, not passing the law because if the technology fails and causes an accident . But why would there be an accident if there would still be a driver in charge of that as well . A human brain with technology would be a perfect combination making it safe for everyone. There is so many kinds of problems in this world right now with driving and people not paying attenton to the roads . That is why if the techology does fail the driver would be in control and would be notified because the techology would give the driver the attention and giving the wheel to the driver. They would have sensors, computer hardware and software to make driving safe. The driverless cars would not only make the roads safer but it would make it better for the driver as well. It would be life changing.

So I think that driverless would be a great why to start off something different and would not cause as much accidents. It would be a smart idea to pass this law
