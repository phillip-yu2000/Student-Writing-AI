The article "Driverless Cars" is about the stance on when and how driverless cars will be made and deploded onto the roads of the United States and elswhere. When I read the article I was fasinated by someparts of the story and not happy about other parts. I believe we shouldn't have driverless cars or have some version where we can turn on and off the driverless mode.

If we have driverless cars I wouldn't buy one because it is so much easier to me in my opinion just to drive it on itself. The reason being is that I don't believe they will be as safe as they say. The reason I say that is because people might want to drive their own cars and people might not like computers controlling their every move. I personally think that since most of the world's population already know how to drive it will just have more deadly accidents. In the story it says "The combination sof all this input is to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel." They don't say it will improve human driving just that it will mimic. So why would we replace something that has worked for a hundred years with something that will work the exact same way and not improve it? I don't get it.

Now I like that we have cars that will be able to make the roads safer with sensors. That's something we can capitilize on, not driverless cars that change nothing except the driver. Tesla will not release a car by 2016 because it is 2016 and I've not heard anything. The technologies not even there for people to drive on highways and it's a big waste of time on all those engineers when they can be making something to make this world better.

I hope you all enjoyed this. If not I'm sorry and i don't realy care. So thanks for everything. This is why we shouldnt have driverless cars. Thanks for nothing.
