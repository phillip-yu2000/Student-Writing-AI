Dear Principle

I would like to tell you that nearly all the students have a C grade average and not a B grade average but I don't want to tell that to you. That is not fair to the student body and you might have wimpy sport teams. Then the entire school might be the laughing stock of the district. So that's why I don't think that you should change the policies in any way possible or imaginative or hurtful.

A B average is asking to much from the jocks and athletes and the entire student body. The athletic groups will be no more the foot ball team will be gone all of them will be gone except for the chess and the robotics clubs and are they fit for hitting into each other especially when the other guy is way big ger than him? Relationships could fall more students might drop out. But the worst thing that could happen the school is being shut down. So are you still going to change the policies? If you are prepare yourself for the headlines of the year "School gets shut down because no students and faculty."
