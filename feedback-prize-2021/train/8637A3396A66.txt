The Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational and should be motifyed and uptated so it is more fair to voters and the rest of the citizens.

The Founding Fathers created it during the Constitution as a compromise. This meaning it was made and disigned for when it was needed. It did help the way presidents were voted for then,but its not suted for the population and other ways it has changed and is different in this time period. Over 60% of voters would prefer a new and direct election rather than the system that we have now.

Under the Electoral College we the people vote for electors, anyone not holding public office, who are chosen depending of the state by either state conventions, state party's central committee, or presidential canidates themselves. While voters are supposed to control who the electer votes for, sometimes they can make a mistake and vote for the wrong canidate. Its not very ofthen that mistakes like these happen, but they do occur. If a mistake like this was to happen the wrong canidate would be voted for that the people didn't choose, resulting in the posibility that a canidate we didnt vote for could and has the possibility if winning.

Something simmailar to this that happened back in 1960 was the biggest election crisis of the century. Segregationists, who favored separation based on race, in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so the popular vote would not have been given to Kennedy and he would noyhave won.

In defense of the Electoral College it was very helpful when it was needed at fisrt, but now it's in the wrong time period. It exceeded Obama's share of the popular vote when he received a 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 perecent of the popular votes cast for him and  Romney in 2012.

In conclusion  the Electoral College should beb changed so we have a new and improved way for the people to vote fairly for who they want.
