To allow cell phones in school is like letting kids play games and school is not fun and games. One reason why cell phones should not be aloud in school is other schools might not allow cell phones so who are we going text or call and why would we just text a person that is only down the hall that we will be talking to in a few minutes at lunch. Another reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is the halls and the lunch room would be really loud from all of the ring tones. That would be really annoying to the students in class. We come to school to learn and having cell phones around us is just distracting. Next thing you'll know students will start bringing ipods, portable gaming systems, and more. So, bringing cell phones to school doesn't help our education. It just distracts us because during class all you can think about is getting out of class to text your friend. I totally think letting kids bring cell phones to school is a bad idea.
