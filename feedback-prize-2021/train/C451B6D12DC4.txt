Have you ever heard of the "Unmasking the face on Mars" before? Well people started making accusations before they got a high quality photograph. They though it was a face aliens had made on Mars, that was one of the many accusation made about the face on Mars.

The face on Mars is just a landmark because "The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 98a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet." So there as a big cloudy winter storm when people discovered the face. Well with all the wind blowing it could of just been made of dirt and rocks and everything blowed into one pile and by a cowincidence been made into a face.

Second another reason why the face is just a landmark because right after the winter storm they got "A 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars." Before they can go make accusations that go into history you have to have a high quaity picture to prove you are right. They got one picture and that is not enough to solve something in history to start making illogical accusations without evidence.

Finally why the face is just a landmark on mars is because instead of waiting to get a high quality image they waited 3 years to go back to Mars to see it. When they finally did go back to see the face they had a lot better and high quality cameras. So when they arrived back on Mars it was proven that the so called face was just a landmark. A quote in the text that makes everything logical is "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."

So there you have it the face on Mars was just a landmark not an alien face.

See before everyone made illogical accusations they did not have a high quality photo and when they first took the photo when it was a cloudy day. NASA is correct because before making accusation they went and got evidence to prove their thoery's.
