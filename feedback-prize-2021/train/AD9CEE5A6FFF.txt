I think it better to talk to more people than just one person, why becase different people have a different way of viewing a situation. People act differnet, one person might be angry and the other might be happy. Thats one of the reasons why i think its better to talk to more people than just one person.

You can see how different poeple think by just starting a conversation, different people might have better advice than others becase of the way they think or how they were taught to do things. Its also good to talk to the people that have been through your situation becase they have been through it and they can give you tips on how to be positive or how to be relaxed in that situition if it ever happens agian.

You can also talk to your familiy members becase they are are close people that you can always trust to help you like a project or just homework things like that so it doesent stress you out so much. Its good to know that someone will always be there to help you out. Thats way i think its better to talk do different people not just one person.

THE END
