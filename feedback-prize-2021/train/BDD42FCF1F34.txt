I think driverless cars are a great idea. If you are a business man and you're busy and you need to get things ready on your way to work driverless cars could help you out, but you still need to pay attention to the road because the driverless cars need to be controlled under certain circumstances.

Although their name is a driverless vehicle a driver still needs to operate it when needed such as when there is consruction or if there is a wreck in the middle of the road so the driver needs to pay attention even if he doesn't need to drive. The car will notify the driver if the road ahead requires human skills by either telling the driver or flashing lights on the dashboard.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passangers, and pedestians safe. Some states think the smart car may abstruct those laws such as California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. These states won't even allow computerdriven cars be tested. I think the idea of a driverless car is great but as you can see some other people don't.
