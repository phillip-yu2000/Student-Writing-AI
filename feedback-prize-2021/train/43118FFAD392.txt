Reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program are so many! Take Luke for a example, He got to explore and see Europe and Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and crossed the Pacific Ocean twice!

Also,Luke didn't just have fun for himself,he also helped people who were affected by World War II. The group that helped those runied countries and affected people were UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Where Luke comes in is when the UNRRA needed people to take care of horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to do that job. After hearing about that Luke and his friend Don signed up. Also its not boring on the ship full of animals because the cowboys could do the following;baseball,vollyball,table-tenis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling and games. Luke went on many amazing places such as the Acropolis in Greece,taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,Luke toured the excavated castle Crete,and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to China,plus that was his only favorite places not all the places he went so you can imagine all of the places you could go!

There so many possibilites you can do with this wonderful job. You can make new friends and see all new places you could never imagine,and even start a new and exciting life.
