" A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009". Limiting the use of cars from people is a great thing to consider. Cutting down the use of cars would reduce harmful toxins in the air that hurt our enviroment and help people save money.

Reduceing the car use of people today would help out our enviroment. To illistrate, smog is a seriosu problem, "cold nights and warm days caused the warm layer of air to trap car emissions"(Duffer, 15). The smog is not good for our enviroment, therefore we should cut down the use of cars to cut down the amouhnt of smog produced. If we maintain our Earth the way it needs to stay healthy then it wouldnt have lots of issues. Keeping up with the no car use "sociologist believe it will-it will have benifical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment"( Rosenthal ,34). America's second largest cause for emissions is transportation. We should completely stop or dirastically reduce the amount of car use. These new changes will help our enviroment stay clean and save our Earth.

Another example of why we should controll the car use is because it will save people money. Now that "118 miles of bicycle paths" (Selsky, 27) have been made people wont have to drive cars. Cars cost a lot more money than a simple bicycle does. You also dont have to maintain a bicycle as much as you do a car.
