I think that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, becuase you see lots of distant places traveling, you help people and animals, and recover food supplies.

Going along with seeing lots of places, you get to go on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, you get to see the Acropolis in Greece, and China and Europe. With going on these tours, you get to give someone a job, by going on the gondola ride.

On the boats that you travel on, you take care of animals on the way to your destination, but when you get there, you care for people and animals alike. You do more with the animals than the people, but I like to care for the cattle and animals more. I care about them, but there are many more people to care for them.

When recovering food supplies, you have to know what they eat. Some need meat, some need fruits, some need vegetables, and some need everything, but that was ok.

But in the end, I did what I wanted, and that was see lots of places, help people and animals, and recovering food supplies. Thank You for reading.
