One of the best ways to get advice is to get multiple peoples opinions. It'll help you get the majority of what advice people have. Theres more people to trust if you can rely on more than one source. It'll also help you see whos advice fits your situation the best.

If you get the majority opinion you can see why the majority advice is most helpful. You will also see why most people offer or have this advice. If the majority of people have this advice then it'll probably help you the best. This advice is probably the advice that is the easiest or the advice that makes you succeed the most.

Its easier to trust advice if its from multiple people. The reason that is is because if your getting advice from a bunch of people if one person gives false advice you still have a bunch of other peoples advice to go off of, and so you'll know which advice is true.

It is also good to have more than one persons advice because you can see everyone else's situations and see the one that relates to you the most. Then you pick the advice that is most like your situation and see what mistakes they made and learn from them, so you dont make those mistakes. It is also important to see what things they accomplished and how you can learn to accomplish those things.

In conclusion Its best to have the majority opinion and to see why so many people used that advice and how it helped them. It'll help you trust those people if they have similar advice, youll also see how those situations relate to you most and how you can learn from them.
