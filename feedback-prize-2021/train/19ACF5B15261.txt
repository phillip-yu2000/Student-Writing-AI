Dear State Senator,

To my understandings, we still use our Electoral College to vote for the President of the United States. So basically, whenever we vote for a President, we're basically voting for a slate of electors. But you probably already knew that. I thought the whole point of voting was to vote for who we want, not pick someone on the side to vote for us. To me, it is only fair that we rid of the Electoral College and change it to an election by popular vote.

When I am old enough to vote, I would like to see that my vote counted for the President and not a group of electors. One main problem with the Electoral College is the fact that the trust can be betrayed. What about what happened in Hawaii in 1960? When Vice President Richard Nixon luckily precided over the senate, validating only his oppenent's electors, but made sure to do so "without establishing a precedent." What if it happens again? You are voting for someone that could be anyone not holding a public office.

If you really think about it, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Think of it like this, you're in a class of 30 and you get to vote on who is your new class president. You all vote but the teacher only counts 10 of the kids' votes that have a higher ranking. It is not fair to the other 20 students because they all voted too, but their votes didn't really count.

The Electoral College can be thought of as unfair, outdated, and irrational. It would be so much easier if we just counted the votes from the citizens of the United States in a majority rules fashion. This way, everyones' vote counts and we wouldn't have to worry relying on someone to make the vote for us.

I am writing to you State Senator to show you how we, the United States of America, really feel. Isn't it true in Amendment 1, that we as the people have a freedom of speech? Well I think my speech should be heard and I want you to listen.

Sincerely,

Rachel       Â
