Dear Principal,

I have a suggestion on the schools cell phone policy. The schools phones either don't work because they are busy, or they are not as easy as cell phones and it takes a while for the call to get through on a regular school phone. I think it would be a great idea if you would let students use their cell phones during lunch time and other free period.

One reason I think students should be able to use their cell phones at lunch first is to call their parents if they need anything. If a student forgot his lunch then the student should be able to call home and ask for a parent to bring it. Another reason students should be allowed cell phones is if they forgot a project or homework and they have not had that class yet they could call home with their cell phones. Teachers would probably not let the student call home on a school phone about homework.

Another reason why students should be able to have their cell phones turned on is if the school phones are not working. If a student needs to call home about staying after school he should be able to use his cell phone . What if the student tried to call from the school phones, then the student stayed after school and didn't have a ride home.

One last reason students should have their cell phones with them if theirs an emergency like a fire or lock down. Students would want to contact their parents and tell them what's going on. This is why students should be allowed to have their cell phones with them and they could use them during lunch time and other free periods. Thank you and please consider my suggestion.
