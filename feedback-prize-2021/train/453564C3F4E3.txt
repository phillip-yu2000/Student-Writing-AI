Dear Principal,

I believe that policy number one is better since I agree that it should be a great idea to be able to have phones. What if you need to use your phone for an occurrence? We will not use them while we are in class but just when we need to. The phone will be turned off while in class so it won't bother the teaching time. In case we have an emergency we will be able to use our phones while in lunch and other free times. So if your parents want you to call them when your coming from school just to check you are all right you will have your phone there with and your parents won't worry. Why would we buy phones if we are not going to be able to use them. It's a good idea that you should only be able to use your phone while in free time and not disturbing your class and your learning. Just in case you have an emergency and you are able to use your phone and not disturb any others hopefully that would be alright with you. You will let us use our phone when we are allowed to and we will not disturb our learning and the teacher. What we would have in mind is that we should use them when we are able to. By the way it's not a good idea to not be able to have phones at school at all because we might need to if we have an emergency or something that we really need to use our phones for. Your students parents might want them to have their phone with them for an emergency or something else. After all we would only probably use them for emergencies.

Sincerely,
