Do you listen to other peoples opinions? Listening to other peoples opinions can be a good or bad thing you decide. I think that when you listen to other peoples opinions on something that could get you in trouble is a good thing because,

if you were going to do something bad and someone close to you says "dont do it" you should not do it. The only way i would personally do something is through my gut instinct.

If your gut is telling you to do something or push towards something i would do it. No matter what go with your gut. If you dont go with your gut you will never know what could have happened if you went with your gut instead you listened to other people. From my own experience i didnt go with my gut one time and i messed everything up with this one person. Know matter what the outcome was at least you can say you went with your gut not with what everyone else told you to do.

Other peoples opinions when you are about to do something bad is the only time I am gonna tell you, you should listen to them. Im saying that because what if you try and do something stupid and they tell you know and give you a good reason why you should not do it. At that point you should listen to them. Do NOT go with your gut instinct that how bad things happen.

Therefore if its not your gut instinct listen to the persons opinion. When you dont thats when we have kids in jail and we dont want that.
