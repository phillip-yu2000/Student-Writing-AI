Dear Principle

I think that it would be a really good idea to make students do community service because, they can learn a lot of things in life, it will also help them with meeting people in life. You should require students to complete students to complete about a total of 30 minutes of community service per day. They should have to do this for a grade kind of like reading logs that are due weekly. Here are the reasons why i think they should have to do this.

The first reason would have to be about learning life experiences they could learn about how bad some people treat earth and how much litter is all over it. They could maybe start a anti-litter group. They could get kids that are in the group from all over the world and, they could even get those kids to help clean up earth.

Another reason is that they could help tutor younger kids or help out in elementary school and help out the teachers. This would also help them in life they might get a since of pride knowing that they might have just changed a little kids life. They might even want to become a teacher when they get older.

My last and final reason is that they might also be able to volunteer at a vet. They could help save a animals life. I know a lot of people that love to be with animals and take care of them. They might grow up to love animals and maybe become a veterinarian.

Those are my 3 reasons on why i think you should require high school students to have to do community service. You could also make it a rule for them to have to take about

50 hours of community service total in a year for students to graduate 12th grade. Thanks for taking the time to read my reasons.
