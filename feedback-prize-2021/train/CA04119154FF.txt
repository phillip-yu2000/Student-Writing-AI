Dear Principal,

My opinion is that we students not always going to have a b average and it won't be fair that the other students who can participate in the sports and the students who have a c average can't participate in the activities and sports. It's not fair to the other students who want to participate in sports and activities at the school. so changing the schools policy wouldn't be fair at all and not all students are the same so i think the school shouldn't change the schools policy. so for that reason i am arguing against changing the schools policy.

And i wish the school policy stays the same so all of us can have fun together, and enjoy playing sports and participating in the schools activities. so we all think it would be better for it to stay that way so everybody can enjoy coming to school more often and participating in the sports and activities that they like to do and have a fun this school year. and that's all we students ask for if you won't change the schools policy at all so life can be fair to us students here at the school.

sincerely
