Do you think that students should do an extracurricular activity? There are multiple opinions on this question. On the other hand I believe that everyone should do an extracurricular activity because they can enjoy a hobby they love, make new friends, and exercise the brain in different ways.

Having time to enjoy a hobby is a special thing. Not everyone gets to enjoy their hobbies everyday. To get to do that after school is an amazing thing. If you want to do a sport, join the team, and do your best. If you like origami, but there isn't a club for that, then start your own club and be in charge. You can always find a way to enjoy your hobbies. You just have to seek it out.

Making new friends can be hard, but with extracurricular activities it can be enjoyable. If you have an interest and others share that interest. Then that could be a start to a good friendship. All you have to do is try to make friends. If you try and you fail, then you have to try again. Eventually you will succeed.

Exercising the brain is really important. Not only does it expand your horizons but it also increases your IQ. If doing an extracurricular activity can enhance my learning process, than i'm all for it. Studies also show that people who do puzzles tend to live longer because they have more brain activity. I think almost everyone wants to live longer. Thats why exercising the brain is so important.

There are a lot of pro's to doing extracurricular activities. If it can improve our lives that much, than im all for it. So do you think that students should do an extracurricular activity? I know that my answer is yes
