In most countries students are required to go to school for ten month every year until they graduate. As a current student i know school can be really stressful,sometimes it can be more than we can handle.

students should be able to relax and do some other things over the summer,but they should also be ready for the upcoming year. Teachers should always be the ones to choose the summer projects. Because most of the time students tend to take the easy way out,but teachers know what the student should prepare for and they know how to push the students out of there comfort zone and experience new things.

Most of the time teachers know what there student needs, some students are doing good in there classes and some students can be having a hard time so if teachers are the ones choosing the summer assigmenst they would be able to help the students having a hard time by giving them more work for practice,and giving work to the ones that are doing good to make sure they keep on doing good.

Students tend to get lazy over the summer if they dont travel,get a job,volunteer,e. t. c they should have something that will get them out of bed and excercise there mind,if they sleep and watch movies all summer they will have a hard time adjusting to waking up early and doing things the next school year.

Teachers should always know when its enough,students have a life besides school they should always give them a medium amount of work so it can be equale not a lot where it takes them all summer to do and not to small where they can finish it the first week of there summer break.
