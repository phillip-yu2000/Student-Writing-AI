In my opinion, I'm against these type of cars. Yes, there are a lot of positives about them, but that doesn't mean they are completely safe and will help humanity.

I can foresee these cars becoming a huge issue. One of those issues I can see happening is that these cars, yeah, they seem safe. Are they really safe though? It seems to me like these cars would get in accidents very easy and could severly hurt someone. Lets say you aren't paying attention to the road, imagine if someone swerves in front of you and its so fast your car doesn't pick up on it. You could end up in a sever accident and possible pass away from lack of paying attention.

Another issue I have with these cars being produced is that it would take away from tradition. Whats even the point of going through driver's ed when you can have an automatic car that does everything for you? It's a right of passage to get your first car and learn how to drive it. It gives you a sense of accomplishment. I wouldn't feel very proud of myself if my car just drove itself.

These are my biggest two problems with these cars being made, and I have more. These cars aren't going to help society they would end up simply destroying it.
