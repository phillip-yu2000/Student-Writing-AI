Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a strict policy about cell phone usage. Some other schools don't stick to that rule as well as we do and you may think that is a problem, but not me. Personally I feel that we (the students) should be allowed to carry our cell phones around and to school if we use them wisely. We should be allowed to use them during passing breaks and at lunch because that will and does not affect our learning.

I see why this rule was so strictly enforced as well because some students could abuse this and bring their phones into class. Just having it in class wouldn't be that bad either but some students may try and use them. Which is why i think the rule of having phones be turned off while in class is the perfect solution. But if the students ever try to abuse that ability of having it with them, then the teachers just need to put their foot down and maybe even give punishments to the students who don't choose to follow their rules.

Some kids only got their cell phones so that their parents could contact them when needed. If students weren't allowed to have their phones then the parents may not be able to reach them when needed. We could check our phones during passing breaks to see if anyone had called or messaged us. Our parents would be happy with this because then we could tell them what they needed or just answer back.

Mostly all the kids here are very mature and I feel would be able to use this privilege in the best way possible. I have never been giving the chance to try, but I know we wouldn't let you down. If you would please consider what I said and let the students of your school, SCHOOL_NAME, have a chance to prove to you how good this can be.

Sinserely
