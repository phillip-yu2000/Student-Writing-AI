Dear Principal,

The argument of not allowing the students to participate in athletic activities, I believe to be unreasonable. The reasons in which you have decided this are understandable, but not fair. Some students have a harder time understanding the work we are given in class and the teachers don't have enough time to sit down with each one in class or out of class. Therefore some students that participate in these activities don't have a very good chance of succeeding at your requirements. Athletics and other activities that we have in school are the things that keep us from out bursting in class. They allow us to let out our energy before coming to class so that we are awake and ready to work. All that I ask is that you allow the students to have at least a grade B average in each class to participate in these activities.

Sincerely,

Students
