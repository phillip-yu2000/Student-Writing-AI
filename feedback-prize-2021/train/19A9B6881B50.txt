Dear principal,

The idea have having students have a B average grade is a wonderful idea!

Students may complain about this but i think it is the best for all of us.

When I played volleyball my couch all ways said that we had to have our grades up.

That is why we are "student athlete's".

Hence the word "student".

It would be very bad if a student was failing because they were working on their jump shots or touch downs instead of their homework.

I know it is hard for a team when there best player cant play because of grades but grades should come first in a persons life!

Sports aren't always going to be there.

Being a famous sport player is not very realistic.

You have to work on your school work because you are more likely going to have a REAL job some day. I heard a story that a friend of mine had a F in math and they wouldn't let her play. Yes, i felt bad for her but at the same time I didn't.

I didn't because if she had just worked harder she wouldn't have to have gone through that. My dad always says "work before play!"

I know students will not be very happy but it is a fact that you have to work on grades more than your athletic career!

That is when u have to keep in mind that you are the rite one.

They are wrong!

You know what is best for them, if they like it or not. So don't listen to there wining!

Give them time to get there grades up then let them in to play.

Go with your gut on what is the good for them.

Having the students have a B average grade is a fantastic idea.

So stick with it!

Students need to work on their path way to collage.

It is a "win, win" situation! They get to play sports and You get your students to get good grades!

So keep in mind "work before play"!!

sincerely your student,
