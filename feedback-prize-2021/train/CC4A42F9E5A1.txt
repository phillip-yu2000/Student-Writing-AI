I like policy one better because it lets you use your cell phone during school. We should be able to use them as long as we don't have any thing to do. What if their was an accident and they couldn't reach your parents. Well i guess then we wont have anyone to know that their in the hospital. Their could be a fire and your phone could get melted if you didn't have it. Then how are they going to get a new phone. At lunch you could use your phone so you could take pictures of you and your friends and put them on facebook. As long as the phones are off during testing and class periods we should be able to use it. Its not like were going o listen to lil Wayne rap us answers.

So we should be able to have our phones and stuff like that with us at school.

If someone is caught texting during class they should have their mom come get it. They should have a detention. Not aloud to have their phone at all in school. So that's why we should be aloud to have our phones.!
