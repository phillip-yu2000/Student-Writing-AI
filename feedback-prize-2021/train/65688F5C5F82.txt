Dear principle,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. i would like to voice my views on community service. this is why many people should do community service.

The first reason is kids can learn about themselves and others. Community service is a great ways to meet new people. Many can learn many great things about themselves and many others.

Community service is a reason for kids to get out of the house. So there not inside on a beautiful day. There lives are being wasted and someone needs to do something. They need to do something with there lives. If they don't then they will not know what to do in the real world. They will then fail in life because they will not have experience with other people and all they want is "There Way".

Most kids could use this so they could meet new people. For example that kid you sit behind in math class might be a pretty cool kid and he could help you study, so you can stop copying of him, you two might even like the same music.

Kids can always learn for those older than them because they have lived longer and can help them more.

all in all, kids can get a positive life started and can meet new people and can learn many things from community service. this is way community service should be required.
