Do you think you should get advice or opinions from yourself or others? How about finally getting an answer to your problem? Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice. It is better than just coming up with a better solution by yourself because it might never help you. We all need to talk to others and see what they think or want to say about it. If we listen to them, we will know what to do. People have different perspectives, have experience from the same situation, and knows how to help.

People have different perspectives of a choice or decision. Everybody has a different opinion since we are all different people. If you talk to multiple people, they all have different answers that can help your problem. One time, my friend was in a very hard situation and needed help. She asked for others on what to do. My friend got many different answers on how to solve it. She didn't agree with some of the people but it still helped her. After talking to a lot of people, my friend finally got an answer that she really liked. Finally, she felt so much better just because of talking to others. Another reason why we should seek multiple opinions is that some people have been in the same place as we are right now.

Some people have experience from the same situation as we might have. Many people might have been in the same place as us and knows what we should do. Studies have shown that over 60% of people worldwide has had the same problems as others. These people have dealt with the problem could help us. Reaching out to others that had the same problem will help you a lot. If you don't have many connections, maybe go to your school or neighborhood that could help. Even your friends might have been in the same position as you. Not everybody has the same exact problem but there is a chance that maybe at least one person that you talk to has. Not only do people have experience from the situation, they also have knowledge on what is best.

The last reason why you should seek multiple opinions is that people know what to do based off wisdom. Many people are smart when it comes to choices or advice. They know what to do when a problem arises and could try to solve it. Many months ago, my sister was having a lot of stress and needed advice. She was in college which is hard and gives her a lot of work. My sister wanted to talk to others since they might have knowledge on it. She went to her friends, family members, and neighbors. She got a lot of advice but none of it worked. Some advice might not help but you should still try to talk to people. Then, somebody gave her very long talk about stress and also gave her advice that actually helped. He didn't have experience from it but still knew what to do. My sister took his advice and it made her feel much better. Although some advice didn't work, my sister kept on trying and we should all do that. Many people know what to do and how to help.

All of us need to seek multiple opinions so it can help us. We should always listen to others instead of ourselves. It will help us now and could help us later in the future. People have different opinions, have been in the same position as us, or just has knowledge of it. All of this can help somebody make a good choice.
