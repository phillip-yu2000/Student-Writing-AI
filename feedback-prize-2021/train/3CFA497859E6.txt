Dear principal,

I don't think it's fair that you can't participate in a sport unless you have a B average. One reason why a student may have a C average is because it's in a subject they struggle with. Personally, I'm not very good with science. The past few years I've been getting C's, and I would have been devastated if i couldn't play the sport I wanted.

Another reason why a student may have a C average is because of stress at home. Many children, kids, and teens stress at home because of a death in the family, a divorce between parents, or may be their parents are just plain jerks. I feel I am lucky to say none of these go on in my home.

I do understand some reasoning for why you want students to have a B average to play sports. Some students try to depend on sports for getting them jobs or into colleges, so they decide to slack off in subjects.

Although I still believe a B average is too high. A C seems to be much more in the middle of grading. A's and B's are the spectacular grades, and D's and F's are the not so spectacular grades, and a C is just in the center.

In the end i do realize you make the decision of the grade needed, but I would be pleased if you would just take my words into consideration.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
