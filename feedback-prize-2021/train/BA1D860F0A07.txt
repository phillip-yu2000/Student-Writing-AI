My response to the cell phone problem

To me if the principal was announcing if cell phones was a good idea to have in school, but not in free time ,or to not have cell phones at all, I would by far chouse to have cell phones at school, however, only on free time. The reason this is so is, imagine you are walking in the hall when all of a sudden you forget something very critical at home, or something horrible just accrued! What do you do? Sure, you can go to the front office and just talk to whoever you need to talk to in there, but what if it's something embarrassing? What if it's something personal? Well then the only thing to do is suck it up and wait tell school is over. Now I know that some people just use cell phones to chill and talk with their friends, but its not like they are going to do anything else on their free time anyway. Not including the fact ,that kids no matter how strict the cell phone policy is will still use their cell phones. So why not let them? It's their choice. If they want to take risks, or want to feel brave that you stood up to call for a personal thing, then they can take the risk. Now personally, having cell phones under a certain age is one thing, but even then, it's the parents choice for giving them a cell phone, or not. Its not the teachers, nor school staffs choice. So you see having cell phones anywhere you go is important for whenever you need to just talk to someone personally and whenever you want to solve your personal needs, without having to suck it up, or hating yourself for being to shy after words. People form all over the world use cell phones on their dayly routines, some more then others. However, that is just the way they are and let them be that way. Let them chouse their path, let them feel good, or learn from their mistakes. What people need to learn is that the number one saying, " The choice is yours!"
