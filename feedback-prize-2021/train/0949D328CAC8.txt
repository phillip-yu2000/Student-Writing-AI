Dear Principal,

I do not think it is right for students to not play any sports, if they do not have at least a B as their grades. For some people it may be hard to get a B as their grades. Students that want to play sports should. They should get at least a C. Some of them may have a weakness in a subject. Some may want to maybe get fit in a sport and make sure their health is good. They cant get that, because they have to get a B as their grades. Then there would be less players in a team of soccer, basketball, or volleyball. Less than half the school will raise their grades up just to be in a sport they may be passionate about. Making the students get a B average to be on a sport could get us students a little upset, because we may not agree on the fact that you do not ask for our opinion. It should be about getting a passing grade, because a C is a passing grade. Many of us have a C average in this school. Please change your mind and see if most of the school agrees or disagrees wit your decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
