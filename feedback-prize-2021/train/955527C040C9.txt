The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could be useful for people that are not around you enough that you have no idea what they are feeling but in most cases most people can tell when their friend is feeling down or not."In fact, we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day. For instance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code." This shows that most people do not know the specific traits that describe the emotion but most people also know that when their friend or family memeber makes a certain facial expresion that they are either happy, sad, mad, or even annoyed.

People can figure things out without needing a machine to do things for them. Maybe for paintings the FACS can be useful but not on ordinary people who know when their friend is feeling down or not. People do not need technology to do everything for them. People need to do things on their own make conclusions to things and if they have no idea what their friend or family is feeling they can just ask.
