Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 is very suitable for our school. There are many reasons why you should go with policy 1 instead of policy 2. I will give you three prime examples why. One reason you should go with policy 1 is, letting us do this will show our responsibility. Another reason is, it shows that you trust us. Lastly, this shows that you are willing to give us some freedom.

As i have stated previously, Policy 1 lets students show how responsible they can be. As students show responsibility it encourages maturity. Maturity is key for any student as they age. Being mature helps students think that they are getting older and can do more. This may lead to a decrease in student related school conflicts.

Showing students that you trust them is key in staff-student relationships. Trusting students also shows that you are willing to help them and get to know them. As students begin to feel trusted they grow to like their staff more. The more they like their staff the less likely they are to get into an argument with them. Students also trust someone more when they know they are being trusted.

Lastly, giving us some freedom will greatly help students with social interactions. School is supposed to be a place where students have time to grow and be free from pressure that they may have at home. Giving a student freedom (to an extent)

will show how the staff cares about them. It's key to give students a little freedom to show that you trust them. Students like me think that school is just another form of prison that its filled with more people to unfairly boss you around. Giving them freedom will show that this is a place for them to enjoy learning.

As you can see there are many reasons for you to go with policy one instead of policy 2. Whether it be to show responsibility. Or possibly to show trust. Maybe to show the students you want them to have some freedom. Policy 1 is obviously the better choice.

Sincerely,

Your student
