When people ask for advice from other's, they tend to ask more than one person. The reason is that they could, meet new people become friends, get better opinion's from other's,make someone's day, or find out something you never knew. Also asking for more advice is give you a better perspective on what your asking.

When you ask for advice, and you ask multipul people it's good to have more that just one opinion on what your asking. Most of the time you get what your looking for, but sometime's you get a different responce. Having more thoughts on what your asking could lead onto something you never knew could lead to someone's missing dog or missing cat could be anything. When asking you could meet new people, hang out with them or when they ask for advice help them out.

Asking more people could honestly make there day. They are just having a really bad day and you come to them and say "Hi! how's your day. Could i ask you something." That right there could make someone's day maybe there dog died or family member died or they have an illness. Maybe you might see there are having a rough day and you try to help them out. Just seeing someone happy get's that good feeling in your body that says "I did good." When asking for advice make sure to have a nice tone to your voice and be polite about it don't be mean or nasty to other's and try to be nice and polite.

For these reason's and the proof i have to back them up asking for advice from more than just one person is good. For more opinion's to help you and meet new people make someone's day, or find out something new. That is why asking for more advice from other's is good.Â
