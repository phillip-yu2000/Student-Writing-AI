In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus' The auther says that stdying Venus is a worthy persuit despite all the dangers because it is Earth's "twin". Venus is the planet next to Earth and sometimes it is the closest to Earth. Mars, Venus, and Earth all orbut the sun at different speeds so there are times when Mars is closer to Earth and other times when Venus is closer. Venus is similar in size and density to Earth.

There are signs that show there once was life on Venus. These include features of rocky sediment such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Our nearest option for a planetary visit is Venus because of all of its features. The atmosphere of Venus is different than ours because it is very hot. If scientists want to be able to visit Venus they would have to hover about 30 miles over the surface to avoid the dangers of the ground. The air pressure is close to the sea level of Earth, it is not easy conditions but it is survivable. The atmosphere is so dense so the forms of light are limited.

So in conclusion, studying Venus is dangerous but a good idea. Venus has many characteristics of Earth and shows clues that there was once life on Venus. There's also dangers to studying Venus because the atmosphere is different than Earth and not what we are used to. I think we should continue to study Venus considering the similarites to Earth. One day we may need another planet like Earth and it may have to be Venus.
