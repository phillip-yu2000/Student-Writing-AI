Hi, I am Luke Bomberger. I am also known as a Seagoing Cowboy. I am here today to try to persuade you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. What you do as a Seagoing Cowboy is deliver supplies and food for the cattle of the people's homes that were distroyed in World War 2. I know that you think this might sound boring but it is actually really intresting because you get to go to alot of different places and see alot of sights. For example, '' I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and china. But seeing the Acropolis in greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Pananama Canal on my way to China.'' Now I bet you see how fun it is to be a Seagoing Cowboy, so come and join!
