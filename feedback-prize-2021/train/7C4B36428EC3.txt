Well, first of all I agree with the new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systyem that enables computers to identify human emotions and I think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because some students might be having some troubles fixing their emotions, and i'm not sure if the essay is to write about the teachers using it to read the students emotions or it is the students theirselves that are using it to read their own expressions, eitherway i'm going to write about the two topics. About what I said about the students fixing their emotions is that some of the students might be so emotional that any little thing like when someone curses them they start crying, they might want to use this technology to see how their emotions are high or low, so they keep track of it and reduce the emotions till their brave enough to face anyone without having a lot of fear in them. And some of the students might have too much anger and they want to reduce it before it cause trouble for them and they might try it(Facial Action Coding System.)

Secondly, about the other topic is that teachers might want to see how their students are feeling, maybe sad or they have something in their mind that is giving them trouble in school or anywhere, because some teachers care for their students and they could ask what the problem is and the teacher might make the student happy by relieving them from the pain they had being through or stress, the student might even forget he/she had a problem because some teachers are good in making people smile like what the article says, "Putting on a happy face" actually works!"
