In the article "Unmasking the Faces on Mars" gives a picture of what apears to be a face, and that is what they thought until more studies show diffrent facts. "NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, sanpping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camras from a region of the red planet called Cybonia." This text fro m"unmasking the Face on Mars" show there was a possible human alien type thing on mars, but after more years of studing the picuter and taking better picures they found this out. "On April 5 1998, when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a pictuer ten times sharper than the original Viking photos." This evidence shows that there is no life forms on mars that we know about.
