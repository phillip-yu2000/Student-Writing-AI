Advice is something we all need at some point, etherÂ it's for something to buy or for making a difficult decision. So let's see the things advice is most useful for. Because, advice is most useful when you least expect it.

One thing advice is useful for is making a difficult decision. An example would be, making a choice that will impact you and everyone around you, it could impact you for the worst so some advice wouldn't hurt. Another would be, deciding what to spend your free time doing, because you could end up doing some thing that would be unentertaining.

The second thing is buying stuff. Advice is really helpful for making sure you don't purchase something you won't be happy with. An example would be a video game, you don't want to end up buying one you won't enjoy, so getting other opinions is extremely helpful. Another would be a book, although you mainly find books that you will most likely enjoy, there are going to be books that you will need more opinions to find out if you will enjoy it.

So, advice is useful for making difficult decisions so you don't end up making a horrible mistake, and for buying stuff so you won't end up getting something you won't enjoy. So, next time your going to do something, make sure you get someone else's opinion so won't make a mistake. Because, advice is extremely helpful when you least expect it.
