School is very stressful for many people. The homework piles on, the deadlines are to soon and to top it all off: there are tests and quizzes no one seems to remember. So to releive that stress in a way, there are online course options. But are online courses, classes from home, really that helpful? Better?

Yes school is stressful, but many focus better at school than at home. At home I have a cat who yells at me, demanding for attention all the time. Then there is my dad who won't stop bothering me when he gets home. Finally, my attention span is one of a goldfish due to my phone just sitting there, waiting, beconning me to get lost in the world of the internet. But at school I dont't have all of those distractions. I'm kept busy and stay focused due to the working environment.

One things schools teach better in person than online is teamwork. There are group projects and the students have to team up with people, either friends or strangers. In the projects we plan what we want to do, distribute the work and communicate. Being able to work with people on a team is an important aspect to learn before heading into the workforce. That is something you can't do when you are at home and an only child.

Despite all of the stress school poses, it is very beneficial. Teamwork and focus are much better in a working environment. The stress of what happens at home forgotten. After all, home is either more stressful or distracting.
