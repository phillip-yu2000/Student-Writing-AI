Dear TEACHER_NAME;

I feel that you should require all students to do at least some community work. The community needs volunteers, and what better candidates than the able-bodied students right here in this school? I know a lot of kids don't want to "waste their time" with such trivial odd-jobs, but they really aren't trivial at all. They don't realize it, but they could be making a big difference in someone's life. I don't know how many times I've heard that we were put here to help others, and i know a lot of other kids have heard it, too. Well, this is our chance to help those others. This is our chance to brighten up somebody's day. This is our chance to make a difference.

Serving the community gives students a sense of accomplishment, and makes them feel like they really are contributing good things to the world. In other words, it makes the students feel good. It feels good to help people, and when you get to do it as a group, with your classmates, it makes it even better! No one really realizes how much help just a couple of kids can give until they actually try. I say we let them have the chance to find out. I think that everyone should get the chance to serve their community. I know everybody has the option, but this might be the first time they've ever seriously thought about giving it a try. I believe we should open up that opportunity to everyone.

In conclusion, yes. I do believe that students should be required to do some community service. It's really not a waste of time if you actually put your heart into it. All options should be open for everybody, and i think that this is a great chance to do some good. Some students might even base their careers off of what they learn while serving the community. You never know where it'll lead when you give someone a chance to try, but you can bet the outcome will be good.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
