more people die in car related accidnts then almost anything else each year. yet we still choose to drive everyday. We choose to put our life in danger to take the easy way out.

Some places around the world does not allow cars to be driven. this does everyone a favor. gives the community a piece of mind while taking a walk. it also forces people who doesnt get out very much to walk where they needed to go. this would help with people being overweight as well. But we are not just hurting ourselves by driving we are also hurting the planet we live on, Earth. Driving is the main source og pollution to our atmoshere. Pollution causes the air to be vey dirty that we have to breath in it also changes the climate. Climate will begin to warm, this has a big effect on everything, even animals.

I also realize some places in the world this is not possible. there is many factors that go into this wether it be saftey reasons or if your like me everything is so spread out. But with that being said cars is not the only means of transportation, subways, railroads and buses are all possibilities too.
