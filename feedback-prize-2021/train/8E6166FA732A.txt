Dear Principal,

I think u should let the students use their cell phones during their lunch periods and free times for three reasons.

First it could be helpful for students to use them. If they forget something at home the can just text some one to bring it to them without bothering the office to use the phone. If its not distracting they should be able to use it. All you have to do is make a rule that there phone has to be on silent or vibrate.

Next, they should be able to use their phones at necessary times with the permission of one of the staff members. Phones these days could be very useful for at school. there are smart phones that have a whole bunch of applications you can download. You could download a times table, a calculator, a periodic time table, stuff about plants stuff like that could really help out the students during the school hours.

Finally, during lunch time it can be really loud in the cafeteria. With the exception of texting it will reduce the sound level because every one will be texting each other.

In, conclusion i really think you should go with your first policy.
