I dont think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because, students should at least have the right to there own personal thoughts. Students are in a building all day with other students and teachers that they might not trust, like, or let alone even know. Students have no freedom in school, teachers make or tell students what to do everything is watched, students are constantly told what to do by adults that they dont know, let alone trust. So i think students should have the right to keep there personal thoughts, opinions, and emotional expressions as private as they want them to be. Unless you know the student is in danger that students personal thoughts, emotional expressions, and opinions should be kept as private as they wish until they are ready to talk about whatever the situation could have been.
