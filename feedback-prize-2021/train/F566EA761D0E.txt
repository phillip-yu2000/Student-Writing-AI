Dear Principal,

Wanting to help your community is a great thing to want . I believe people who do community service make the world a better place, but I also believe that doing community service should be done by what is in a persons heart to do, not what the principal requires them to do.

For example, my aunt does a free pancake breakfast on one Saturday of every month at the church she attends . She felt it in her heart that she should help out the community and its residents, so she started doing this pancake breakfast. Now if she had been forced to do it, she would probably dread that one Saturday of every month where she would provide a meal for the people of the community. I don't think that community service should be a chore or a requirement.

Another example, my dad has a friend who is a pastor at a little church. Every month they have a food bank where people who cannot afford food can come and take what they need. Again this was not assigned by the church, this was not forced upon him by the city, he wanted to help his community out, which is what I think community service is all about.

I believe community service is an excellent thing, but I think it should be encouraged to do, not forced. I hope you take this int

Sincerely,
