In today's world, about everyone has a cell phone & a vehicle. Most people use their phone while they are driving. Drivers believe it's safe but other's believe it's dangerous. In my opinion, I think that drivers shouldn't be driving while using their cell phones. Not only are you putting yourself in danger, your also putting the ones around you in danger. It will also make you more aware of your surroundings.

Driving while using a cell phone can be dangerous. Most drivers like to text while they are driving. That can be dangerous because you will be distracted from the road. The most common cause of car accidents is drivers operating a cell phone while driving. Texting & driving is what causes most car accidents. The driver focus will be more on the phone then the road. When most people get a text or notification on their cell phone, they usually respond or check it immediately.

If drivers stay off their phone while driving, they will be more aware of their surroundings. When driving, you have to be aware of pedestrians & other cars around you. Not all drivers around you will be paying attention while driving. Not only drivers, but other pedestrians around. If children are crossing the road & your focus is on your cell phone & not the road, you are putting them in harm. Being aware of your surroundings is one of the most important things to do when operating a vehicle.

It's important that you don't operate a cell phone while driving. Not only for your safety but for the others around you. If it's a situation when you have to respond immediately, wait until you come to a complete stop or pull over to the side. Safety is more important than anything. The smallest mistake can put you in the biggest situation. That's why you should keep your eyes on the road & off of your cellphone.
