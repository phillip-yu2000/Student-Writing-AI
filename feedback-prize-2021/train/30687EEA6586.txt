Imagine your father inviting you to play for the biggest football club in the world, which he manages, but your best friend plays for their rival team, which you were also invited to play for. Now you have to choose between your father and your best friend. You won't always have to make these decisions on your own. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you will see different point of views in a stituation, some people could be more experienced in certain subjects, and they can help in stressful times when you can't think clearly.

First, you will see different point of views in a situation. People will give you many different thoughts about things. Not all of these thoughts can be right. Some opinions can be more trustworthy than others. Maybe your little brother's opinion can be more acknowledgeable than your mother's opinion. Other's might have more knowledge in areas you struggle with. This knowledge will be very essential in decision making. People thinking differently is just one of many ways seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice.

Some people could be more experienced in certain subjects. A doctor would give good advice on your health. Maybe you need to decide on whether to go to school or not when you've been vomiting all morning. A doctor will surely say, "You should definitely stay in bed." A sibling could also give good advice. Lets say you can't decide on which electives to choose for your freshman year of high school, an older sibling will be the perfect person to go to for advice. An athlete is another person who can give good advice. They can give you advice on a sport, fitness, perseverance, and many other things. Although people being more experienced than you can help you make better choices, this is just another reason seeking multiple opinions can help make a better choice.

Finally, they can help you in stressful times when you can't think clearly. Since your mother knows many of your attributes, she could give good advice. She could be helpful in situations where you get lost and don't know what to do. A therapist could be helpful when you're stressed. Since it's basically a therapist's job to comfort you, it would be a simple task to give you advice. Even a younger sibling could be helpful. If they make you feel happy and safe, they can take stress off you and give you tips. It would be essential if you got rid of any stress so you can make better decisions.

Finding different opinions when looking for advice can help someone make a better decision. This can help someone make a better choice because you will view a variety of perspectives in different circumstances, certain individuals might be more advanced in different areas, and they can assist you in anxious situations where you can't think straight. Your true loved ones will tell you when something is right or wrong.
