I think that it is not an alien face because in the text it states " There was no alien monument after all.". They used an digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, and because the text states that "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or measa landforms common around the American West."

The first reason why I say that it was not an alien head is because It was just a natural landform. That is because when the had the chance to take the picture they did and when it first appeared on a JPL web site showing that it wsa an natural landform, that it was nothing that you could now but not tell no one. Some people thought that it was still a alien head but had no proof abut it they had proof that it was an landform.

Another reason why I thnk it is an alien head is because they had digtial image 3 times bigger than te pixel size so if something was there they could see what it was, it was best Viking photo ever so they could not have said nothing. You could see almost anything out that picture even something small you could see it so there wa no way that it was an alien face.

Last reason why is becase when they got a look it was actually a "butte or mesaÂ—landforms common around the American West nd it's as common to see around there. I was very hard work in order to do that anyway so if they were wrong why would they waste so much time doing this anyway. When they came back everyone was waiting and when they got the picture it was just an landform and they had so much proof about it to.

In conclusion everyone has there opinion and they believe what they want and sometimes people had proof about that they think is going on and that some people don't they just think that it looks like something that it is always going to be what you think it is. You have to have evidence to back up your thoughts or no one will believe you.
