Dear Mr. Principal

I think its a good thing to have community service after school it will help children stay out of trouble. Children wont get involved in to gangs and if they do community service they wont be into drugs and they will get a better chance of succeeding in this world.

Community service would help the children of the future and make the world a better place with less gangs and drug dealers. The children would be better of making the world be greener and a nicer place to live with less violence in the world. With the kids doing community service they should feel good and feel like they achieved something. Kids might see it as a waste off time but in the long run it will have payed off and kids will be much wiser in the future.

Children doing community service are giving up some of there time to help other people eat sleep etc. The children learn to be responsible and respectful to others and themselves. Children helping the community are helping other little kids with the school studies so they could do good in school and the little kids have someone good to look up to when there growing up.

If children are helping the community maybe there parents or there grandparents will help a little boy read or pick up litter on the side of the road etc. There parents are helping the community so its like double the goodness. Parents would help people more and be more respectful and be thankful for what they have in life. And start a new life with better decisions.

In conclusion with community service after school kids would be better off in life and the world would be safer and less gangs and drugs in the country. People would be thankful for what they have and not be so selfish and they would see how other people lived. That's why I think its a positive thing to have community service after school.
