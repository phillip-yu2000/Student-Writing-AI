Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that policy 2 (do not allow students to have phones at school at all) would be the best choice for our school. Our students will probably be more focused and get better grades.

First of all, i think the students at our school will be more focused. I think so because their phone wont be ringing or distracting them at school. They would probably be texting someone during class and wouldn't be listening to the teachers and wont be learning anything. The point of coming to school is to learn and gain knowledge, not text and socialize. If they didn't have any phones, then they would be listening to the teachers and get a better education. Then the teachers wont be just wasting their time talking to them selves.

Also no phones allowed would most likely bring students better grades. I think this because they wont have their phone to play with and would learn something as i said in paragraph two. They would know the answers to tests and know how to do there homework. which is over all a better grade.

This is a better choice then policy 1 because they will still be able to have there phone and will either sneak it into class and that will be just the same as having there phone in class. Or they might be talking to someone during their free time in the library through the phone making noise causing a distraction to someone else in the library that is trying to study for a quiz, and now they cant because someone is distracting that person.

So TEACHER_NAME

i think policy 2 would be the best choice. It'll make students more focused and attentive, and students will get better grades.
