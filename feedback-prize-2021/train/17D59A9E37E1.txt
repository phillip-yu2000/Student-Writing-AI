Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that all kids should have to do community service. There are a few reasons why i believe that they all should have to. If you want to be part of a friendly community you should take part in your city. Also if you have to do community service it could be just little things like helping a teacher after school. It doesn't have to be a huge job that you can not handle. I know some kids might be upset with this but I think that it is right that everyone has to take part in their community. I don't think it should be hard to find a way to help out in your community.

You could do a lot of jobs in your community.

If you don't have the time to do this community service I think you should talk to your teacher about how you could earn your community service during school hours. Some jobs you could do in your community are that you can help out at a fundraising event. Also you could try to help tutor a person in your class or even a younger sibling or even someone in your neighborhood. You could help out at like a school activity for a younger sibling so you could get fun out of what you did. There are so many other things people could do for community service.

I could go on and on about jobs they can do but I just want to get the point across that kids are not part of their community anymore like they us to be. I know a lot of people might have different opinions but I think it is just a good deed you put it for the day. I don't think it should be hard to find a way to help out in your community. I believe that each and every student in our school should have to put forward a few hours of community service. Thanks for you time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
