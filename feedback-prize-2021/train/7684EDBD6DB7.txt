Dear Principal,

I think that students should be required to do community service due to the fact that some people have a bunch of time because no one has nothing to do. If you can make students do community service that will feel good that they have done something good for the community and help others. Other people don't do it because they just want money and don't care about anyone but themselves. I believe that if you make everyone do community service, it will help keep a clean environment for the district.

Another reason is people who are old can't work as well and need help.

If we can help those old people, they might be able to feel more appreciated than before.

The elderly need help to do things.

I've seen old people who struggle to keep the house clean or the clean the leaves during the fall and the snow during the winter.

They are the most important they because you learn new thing from them.

Some of them are still alive when there was world war two.

Others know thing that other people didn't know.

For example that Hitler had a little bit of

Jew inside him.

Most important is that students will go out and be more active than staying inside the house and playing video games.

So in conclusion, I think students should do at least twenty hours of community service and be able to get out and be active and be a little bit more fit.
