Texting while Driving

Many people love their cell phones for calling, texting, listening to music, playing games and more. I believe no one should be on their cell phone or electronic devices while driving for their safety and their peers safety. When texting while driving could cause you to get to focused on your conversation on the phone and causes you to not pay attention on the road and the driver might end up driving off of the road into another lane, hitting another car, and etc when you can just wait until you reach your destination.

Most cars there is no need of touching your phone because there is a build in voice system you could talk to and say the message you want to send out loud instead of texting. Phone stands are good while driving also, it comes in handy while using a gps or even wanting to send a text message because your not physically holding your phone, it's sitting up on a stand in front of you.

When you text and drive it increases the chances of a crash by 23 percent. Over 424,000 people were injured in car crashes from texting and driving.
