Dear, Principal

I think requiring students to do some community services is a great idea. I think that community services is a great way that we can help are community and a great way to help the environment.

Community services can be quick and easy. I know that when I help another person out how happy that makes me. My family and I have been helping out at toy rescue mission for a couple of years around the holiday time. I also help out by help coach my little sisters volleyball team a couple times a week.

I know a lot of people would say there way to busy to do community services. But I would tell them if I can find time so can you. I'm just as busy as anyone else. There a lot of fun and easy way to help out such as volunteering at your local soup kitchen, picking up trash, helping an old neighbor out, or helping coach a team. These may not sound like all that much fun but if do it with a friend and have a good attitude it could be a blast!

whatever the case may be comminute services is a great way to help others, and can be a lot of fun if you have a positive attitude.
