Technology that reads emotion? sounds like a crzy mad great thing huh? well let me tell you why I think its a bad idea for the rt community..

In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author talks about this "amazing" technology that can read emotion from a 3D picture. The reason that I think the Technology is a bad thing is becasue yes its good that the technology can read emotion of paintings but its not at the same time.

Its not a good thing becasue thats the art of looking at the art, to figure the emotion out on your own, seeing the different emotions and seeing the anger or the confusion instead of having it told to you. thats the beauty of looking at the art and in my opinion the Technology ruins that beauty by telling the emotion.

thats why I think this new emotion reading technology is bad for the art community and isnt valueable.
