Dear Editor:

Students should have a say so in what they want to play. if you only let the students with the B average play that wouldn't be right to the other students. The principal should make that if any student has less than a C average then they cant play until they bring their grades up. The students that are on the team shouldn't be getting in trouble in school and if they do then they miss a game and if they do it three times in a row they should be kicked off the team or just not able to play for awhile.

So here are some reasons why you should let more people try out and with the grade problems.

There are lots of good examples why the students should have a C average or higher to play sports. The first reason is that many of the students have a C average or higher to play and that would mean more people would try out and you would have a lot more choices to make on who gets on the team instead of a few people trying out. If the students do make the team and there grade drops because of not doing and homework and not doing good on a test then they should have someone help them so they can stay on the team and still get good grades. If you do choose to have a B average or above that wouldn't be fair to the other students who are really close to have that but they have lower than what is required to try out. When you make the team you have to keep your grades up and if they fall to low you wont be able to play in some of the games. These are just a few reasons why you should keep the C average instead of a B average and higher because that wouldn't be fair for some of the students at the school that would like to play some of the sports.
