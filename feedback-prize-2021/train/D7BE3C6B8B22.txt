Do you believe in aliens creatinf landforms on planets? Than you might've heard about the Face on Mars being created by aliens. It's possible that it is not created by aliens, there is a possibility that is was created by a naturally. The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

The Face is a landform that was not created by aliens. Nobody really has evidence that it was created by an aliens. Several people do belive it was created by aliens though. But there is also no scientific research or evidnce that aliens are real. Which all leads up to, "Is the Face on Mars really made by aliens?" the answer is no

Micheal Malin and his team snapped a photo of the Face that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. In the last sentence, paragraph 7 in the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" it states that there is no alien monument after all. This is because the landform was made naturally not by aliens.

This shows that is is possible for the landform to be made naturally and not by aliens. The landform has no sign that an aliens was around the landform either. Which is why the lanform is natural, not built by some other thing such as an alien.
