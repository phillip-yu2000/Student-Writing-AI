Dear School Principal,

I think that it is best to allow students to be able to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. This way students are not looking at there phones during class and not paying attention. Also so the students don't distract others that are working with the sounds the phone makes. Allowing students to bring out their phones during lunch and free times lets them text, make calls, check E-mails, and go on the internet with out distracting any students and/or getting the phone taken up. If students are not allowed to bring phones to school at all they won't be able to contact their parents incase they need to. You might tell the students to use the school phones. Even though that is a good way for students to make calls to their parents they may not know the phone number by memory and they will not have their phone to look it up under the contacts. Not allowing students to bring phones to school may cause problems with their parents.

It is better to allow students bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times. Students will agree to turn off their phones during class as long as they have time to use them.
