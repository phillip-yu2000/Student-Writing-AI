Cars have been a great tool for transportation, but has it really helped us. or is it that we are just too lazy to walk to our friends house or go to scool. I think that with out cars we would be fine. we just have to get use to it like we do with most things in life. Cars have helped us with time and comfterbility but i feel like is also hurting us,because we are getting use to a bad habit because we always want to use our cars when ever we go anywhere. I people in the united states are starting to realize that because in 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995. that means that some people are starting to stop using theyre cars because we are witnessing a long term cultural shif. With out cars i feel like pollution wouldnt effect us as it is right now, the cars is whats causing pollution because of the gas. most kids are starting to not care about cars. the reason for that is because they have found it easier to communicate because now we have all this smart phones and we dont have to be going to our friends house becayse we have facetime and things like that on our phones. now a car is just a means of getting from A to B when baert doesnt work. We can live with out cars its just a thing of getting use to. all we have to do is give it our best and we would actually be helping the world because poluttion wouldnt be as bad abd people will actually walk to places unstead of been lazy and driving theyre cars everywhere.
