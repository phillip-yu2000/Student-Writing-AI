I am going to write a essay about a aticle named A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves BY: Peggy Reif Miller

The reason I would want to participate in this program is because I like going on boat tripps, and you can learn a lot about fishing and it is a good job.

Lukes claims are that he wanted to go seagoing because it is a opportunity of a life time he said. He wanted to go sea going because he likes learning new things, and it sounded fun to him. In agust 1945, Don and Luke received their first orders to go to new orleans.

What I am trying to say is you can learn a lot, go fishing, It is fun, and you can go on really awsome trips. So if you like learning, having fun, and going on awsome trips then join the program Seagoing Cowboys.
