I think that the face is just a natural landform. Sure, it was insane to discover a face on Mars, but couldn't it be some work that God had Created? The face is quite the story teller, and it will absolutely bring the attention to conspiracy theorists. But God is the creator of the universe, this could very well be some random thing that's just on Mars.

There are a lot of random items just like this all over Earth, things that make scientist believe that there is life on other planets-which could possibly be true-but these questions are unexplainable to science. God is the answer to all the questions we need to know. So this face on Mars, could simply be something very random.

The article expresses that the face is indeed false, and just an ordinary natural landform. Sometimes there are people who try to figure out how and why these kind of things happen, such as this face on Mars. but sometimes science can't answer these questions.
