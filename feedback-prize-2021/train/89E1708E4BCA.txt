I strongly believe the principal should pick the first policy because kids would get in less trouble. now i have a couple of reasons why we should have cell phones.

my first reason why is that kids would get in less trouble. they wouldn't have to sneak around and text or talk on the phone in class. they wouldn't have to always have to go to the restroom to call there mom or text a friend.

my second reason is what if something bad or embarrassing happens to you. what if u get sick or you fall into mud or you fall and hurt your self. then that is when you can use your phone to call for help our call your mom.

my third and final reason is what if you catch a bull or kids doing stuff there not supposed to. if you catch this stuff u can call the office or a teacher or even a principal.

then again people would say phones are a distraction or that if you need something go to the office. for kids its not that simple what if its really embarrassing it would ruin there reputation or there in a big problem.

these are my reasons why i think the first policy would work. my first reason kids would get in less trouble. second reason if somethin
