Wow can you believe if you take a picture on your phone or social meadi it can tell you what your emotionals are now thats pretty wild i dont care who you are.

My opion for this topic i think its pretty stupid because its non of there bussines what my emotionals are and im sure others agree with me. Maybe they dont like to smile but they sure can be happy my dad always told me never juge a book its cover and thats what their doing.

I wouldnt like it because i dont want them to know what my emotions are because its my emotion i will deal with them i dont want know one eles to. In pargraph two it says " can we actually calculate emotion like math homework" emotions are not problems and just part of life you cant fix that the person who has the emotion problem if there sad or angry there the one that will fix.

There is one good thing about this emtional problem if somone takes a picture and there sad and there thinking about ending their life somone can see it and contact someone and they could change their life around thats is on good thing i like it about.

This picture emotional thing it can help alot of people if they dont even know what there feeling and it make save people and some people might just hate it but everyone has their own opion and thats my.
