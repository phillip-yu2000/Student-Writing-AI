I think that it is good to ask other people for advice because they can have different mind sets on what you need advice on and might give you a better idea, you should also get more opinions on the topic because some people might be more mature than you and know whats right and wrong, and if you have multiple opinions you can shorten them down to the best points of advice then you can choose whats best for you and the route that you are going down.

However I think that when it comes to getting advice you should really know who its coming from not just a friend but you should always ask an adult for their opinion to because adults have been around longer than kids and chances are they will know how to handle the situation better. On the other hand if an adult needs help they could talk to other trustworthy adults or even their own parents to get the best advice for them. Most importantly I just think you need to talk to someone you are close to or trust because I would not want an opinion from just anybody especially if its important or personal because they dont know you as well as others. Once you have collected all of the opinions you could sort them to the most common answer you got or if someone told you something that you did not think of and you like that idea better than yours than thats another option you could use. I think that one of the best people to get advice from is your parents because they know you better than others and care about you more than other people or just anyone in your family, but you still want to get advice from as many people possible. If you need advice that is personal or health related you should go to not just one doctor but multiple and see what they all think so you can get advice all around the spectrum or if its really personal than thats another good reason to go to your parents because they can talk to you about any thing. plus getting advice from this many people might bring up reasons why you should take their advice or not.

Here are some reasons why you should get advice from older people, they are more mature and can tell you their experiences on why or why you should not do something especially if they actually were in the same spot as you at one point in their life, they know whats right and wrong plus they have a way of really making their advice stand out because they really do know what they are talking about, and they might care about the situation from a different point of view than others like your friends they wont just say yes or no they will put some thought into to really help you out like grandparents.

Reasons on why you should get advice from your parents, your parents know you better than anyone believe it or not so they know you and how you act and overall know whats best for you and what you need advice with, they will put more thought into the situation and take time to give you their best advice, and if its is advice about something personal you should not let every one know and your parents can talk to you about it without you being shy or bashful about the topic and most likely your parents will know where you are coming from so there is no reason to be shy about it.

Here are some good reasons on why you should get advice from your friends, one of the biggest reasons you should get advice from friends is because they might know a different side of you than others because your parents dont see you at school or go to the parties with you so there is a good chance that they have seen a side of you that is bad or some of the decisions that you make around your peers, another reason is because your friends can pump you up and put you down really fast so they might be able to really tell you why you should take their advice and not someone else's or vice versa, and you might think its easier to take advice from them because you know them well and you are friends and it might not be as intimidating as the other options they are also really understanding and care about you is they are a good friend, also like I just mentioned it should be a good friend you are talking to because if you tell the wrong person they can end up telling more people than who you wanted to know about the situation.

In conclusion I think that the main points are that you really need to know who you are talking to because if you dont then the person you asked might tell everybody things that they dont need to know and then you will be even more stressed and possibly get made fun of just because of one person that you now cant ever trust again. Also having a wide range of opinions can really show how much people care about you and it can really help make this process easier on your self. One very important thing is that dont just get it from one of each of these people get it from as many as possible ask multiple older people, ask both of your parents, and ask multiple friends because if you do it could really help. It is extremely important to get advice from all mind sets but there is one thing that I can not stress enough and that that the person you are saying this to needs to care about you if you ask someone off the street they might tell you something that could get you in a lot of trouble it need to come from a reliable source because you could end up in a bad situation because of one person giving you bad advice so when asking for advice you really need to be carefull and put thought into who you are asking this from. I think that every one needs to know this because if they dont they might not get whats best for them but I do think that is is important to get an opinion from everyone because knowing more than just your mindset on the situation can really help in the long run and make sure that you ask the person giving you advice thinks that their advice is best for you and why you should not take another route that is a big reason why you should ask multiple people then you just take all your answers and shorten them down to what suits you and why.
