There is always a time where you need advice for something like a project or something important and you get confused and need help and ask someone for help and they might not know a lot about what you need help in so you ask more people for help and finally get what you need help in and I think asking for more than one persons advice can be helpful because everyone can know what you need help in and can share their opinion,get help by researching with someone,and asking for help by a teacher or parent.

my first reason why multiple opinions is helpful is when you are having struggles in something like in classes or class work time and are confused in how to answer or how to find the answer to a question or something else, one thing I would do if I was confused is ask the people in my table and they could give suggestions or share their advice about my question and what i'm confused about. Also when I need help I would also try telling the people in my table what I know about my question and they could say something about that and that would help me much better.

my second reason why multiple opinions is helpful is when your assigned a project and are in groups and your have to answer the questions and sometimes I would get confused with the questions I don't know and one thing I always ask is what to do and how to find the answers and my partner would sometimes show me where to look in the textbooks and what sites to use to find the answers and that helps me because when I get confused in something most of the time for me reading it or searching it up would help me understand better.

my third reason why multiple opinions is helpful is when I have to do work at home my parent could see i'm struggling and offer advice in my problems and that would help me but if i'm still confused I would go to my teacher who gave me the work and say I couldn't understand what you were asking for and the teacher can show me how to find the answers and tell me I should try using my notes and writing down every way to solve that question or more.

In conclusion about asking multiple people for their opinion what I though about asking more than one person for their opinion or advice is that would help a lot and can get you to learn from that by trying what you've learned from their advice and opinions. Also I recommend that most people who have troubles with things at school they should ask the people around them and use what you have.
