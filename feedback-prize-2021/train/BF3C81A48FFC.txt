I am all for these driverless cars. There are a few exceptions but for the most part i feel that they could bring a sense of relaxation and stress relief for drivers on roads. As a consumer i fell that is what feels more comfortable while traveling. As it says in the article, the driverless cars need assistance from the person driving it at all times. We could put forth funding and technology for this program and in a few years, we may just have driverless cars that could take you anywhere.

I see that if there was to be a wreck involving one of these cars it could easily be blamed on the manufacturer. But reported as today there have been no accidents involving these cars. These cars are getting safer and safer as we speak. Although there are people assisting these cars they pretty much drive the most part for themselves.

As we put more research and effort with funding into these cars we could have a flawless car that is safe and ecofriendly. The driverless car may become the new trend here in the next few years. There could be zero room for mistakes and therefor making this driverless car the safest way to travel.
