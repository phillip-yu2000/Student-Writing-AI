Dear, Principal

The change you have made in the policy of maintaining a B grade average to participate in other school activities is a great decision.

There are many reasons why this is a good decision.

For example students will be forced to work harder in school.

The students would be study more and to do their homework more often if they wanted to play any sports or other after school activities.

Further more the some of the students would be less stressed over tests they have to take.

The students would of studied more to get at least a B on the tests so they wouldn't be as worried about the test.

The students would also become smarter and will realize school comes before sports or other after school activities.

This would help them in other activities that they are doing such as sports.

The students will work a lot harder in school by changing the policy.

Changing the policy from maintaining a C average to a B average is a Good idea.

The students will study harder, do their homework, and become smarter by doing this.
