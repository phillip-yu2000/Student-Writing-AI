I think that driverless car will be pretty cool, but I don't know I would feel safe with them. Eventhrough, the human driver can take over when requires to, I still don't feel safe with a carmera being in the car and the car watching me. Also, if the car does start to break down and the signals don't go off, what will have to that humand driver and other passagers? Will ther be insurance for them? Will it happen to other cars? And what happens when other people found out what happened to the car the broke down and caused an accident? Because I doubt they are going to want to keep driving that driverless car. These are things the manufacturers have to watch out for and many others.

I am not say I don't like that idea of a driverless car, I am just saying that they need to put everyting that can happen into concerteration. Not everyone is going to want a driverless car. Some people are going to want to keep their human driven cars. But I do thing it can be done and it will be done, someday in the near future.

Therefore, driverless cars are not impossible, but I don't think that today is that day is the day. We need to research ever possiblity before it happens. We also need to get othe peoples oppinion on this, such as the elderly. So yes, I do think think driverless cars are a good idea, and hopefully one day soon they will be a part of this world.
