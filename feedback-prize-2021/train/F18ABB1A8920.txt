Dear TEACHER_NAME,

You recently posed a school wide question you asked would it be acceptable to change your policy for sports. My answer is no, currently the policy is if you have a C average as in a 70 or above you can play. You want to change it to a B or higher, as in an 80 or above average in everything. I object to this policy because their are people who can barely make it to a 70 an eighty percent average would kill off virtually the whole team in every single sport. Most people in school have one subject they are just terrible at, why ostracize them and make them feel insolent because they cant live up to your unrealistic standard. I am not saying that they are incapable I'm just saying that it would eliminate many who are struggling to keep their C' s from becoming F' s and failing. They have enough academic problems without trying to get a B as apposed to a C. Plus they are going to worry about their grade dropping and not focus on the game then we'll have a losing season and if we went by grades then all our good players would get put off the team for being "below your standards". By changing that policy you are making them feel insolent and ignorant for not being able to reach your standard them eventually they will just give up and the retention rate would go up and the schools academic credentials would lower to nonexistence. Would you really want that to happen all because you wanted to start a new policy? Please don't change our policy for sports our players understand academics comes first but that policy would kill them all off and scare away recruits for next year.

Sincerely,
