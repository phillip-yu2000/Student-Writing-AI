I strongly disagree with students having to participate in extracurricular activities because students come home tired from hours of work. They come home with having to do work at home and having to do homework from the school. I think it is a horrible idea to put students on an extracurricular activities that they maybe dont even want to be in. Kids having to do a extracurricular activity that they didnt even want to do can lead to stress on the student.

One reason is that students come home to having to work at home and work from the school. They have so much to do and only having very little to even no free time. Adding an extracurricular activity in the students day is very stressful for the kid. For example, some kids come home from school, he/she will go to work from home and then work from school. Even having to go to school for hours doing tests, assignments, work, projects and more. This adds up so much stress for the student.

Another reason is that students come home tired and stressed knowing that they have to do more work at home. The kids need to have rest and free time at home. It is so unfair to a student that they have to do an extracurricular activity on top of all the work that they have to do after school. An example is, A student having to do a extracurricular activity that they didnt even want to do in the first place causes the to get really stressed on all of this work that the student has to go through.

I disagreed with having a student participate in a extracurricular activity. It is just so ridiculous on how much work the students are getting. These are kids not adults, they cant let kids do so much work at home and at school. They need their rest, they need their free time and sleep. With all of this work on a student, its just very stressful on the kid.
