Driverless Cars Are Coming

If the factories made driverless cars I think they would be dangerous, because you can be sitting back on your phone while the car is driving for you thinking it's safe. Then out of no where your car crashes because it made a signal that there was a work zone ahead but you were to busy on your phone and you crash. That's dangerous, also what if the cars way of getting the drivers attention doesn't work when it is needed and there is a big crash, that is even more dangerous.

It can also be a good thing to invest in because of the special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Some people will ignore that because they feel that they safe because of the driverless car. That is not the case it is almost driverless but not fully, because you still have to keep your eyes on the road and listen for the signals the car gives you. You still have to drive the car and watch for precausions. The GM has developed a seat that vibrates when the car is in danger of backing into something, that is a good thing for reversing and parralel parking. The car also announces when the driver should be prepared to take over, they are also considering putting flashing lights on the windshield so the car can be seen better at night. The driverless car also has a camera built into it so it can watch the driver and make sure he or she is focused on the road at all times. but the driver also has to watch the road.

I would not recommend this car to people who are lazy or does not pay attention to signs because it would be putting other people in danger because of their lack of attention. I think this car deserves a class to be tooken before you are allowed to get the car to make sure you meet the requirements. This car can be a danger to the world or a great and safer way to drive for the world, it all depends on you.
