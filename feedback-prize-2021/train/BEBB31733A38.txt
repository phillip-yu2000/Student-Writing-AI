Although we shouldn't be using our phones but we can't stop because we are addicted to our phones. I do think they should have it to where it is hand free. I think drivers should not be able to use phones . I think they should not have phones because it's not safe and can cause a lot of injures. I also think they should not have phones because it makes the driver side tracked. I also think it should be a certain thing they could use instead of the phones. I think they should not be on phones also because it can distract another driver. I think people should not have phones.

I think they should not be abandoned from using their phones while in the car. I don't like the fact that they be having it set up to where it locks in the car. I don't like the fact that they be having it to where it wont let you press nothing or hook up bluetooth while the car is in motion. I think they should have phones also because they might need there phone to bluetooth and might want to use there phone to text someone to let them know how far they are or where to go.

I think we should be able to have phones in the car. We need our phones to use the gps, listen to music, and asses things. I think we should be able to have phones but they make it to where we don't use our hands we just use a a car bluetooth. I also think that we should have car automatics.
