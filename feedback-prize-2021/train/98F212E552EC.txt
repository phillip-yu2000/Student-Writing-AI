I feel like we should change the votes and make it into a popular vote for the president of the United States. In a electoral vote is most worrying of a tie. Its also unfair to most people. Also electoral college systems voters don't vote for the president. People always get confused with the voting which makes electoral voting a struggle.

One of the main reasons is that people worry about electoral votes ending in a tie. In the article it states that if it does end in a tie, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. This is where state delegations vote on the president. Also the Senate would choose the vice-president.

Another reason, it is unfair to most people. Now it all counts as to one vote for the whole state. If most people vote for the president the like its only going to get one vote for the state. In the article it states that this type of vote the currently have is a "winner takes all' vote. Which in the thoughts of most people is unreasonable and also unfair.

Also, in the electoral college system, people don't vote for the president. A very few of it elects the president. The problem with this is who are the electors, who picks them and it states that it can be anyone that is not holding the office. So most of the voters get confused about the electors and they may vote the wrong candidate.

In conclusion, those are the reason why the electoral system are wrong. It's unfair to most people, it might end in a tie and the voting is confusing. This should be a contest of who gets more votes, not by the states vote.
