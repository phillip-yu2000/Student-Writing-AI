Spending gargantuan amounts of time making self-driving cars is a bad idea. Sure, there would probably be less accidents and less rule breaking but in the long run, that would cause a lot of unemployment. If people no longer have to drive themselves, that would mean that police men would not need to arrest people from the road. Although that seems like a good thing (and it is meaning that there will be less accidents), not every police man can be a detective. In that case, there would be less job oppotunities and more unemployment with, which seems to be a more important issue than having possible car trouble.

If people would be a little more responsible in the way they drive, there would be no need to make cars that drive themselves. Instead, we should be thinking more into the lines of a beter fuel source. This is why spending gargantuan amounts of time making self-driving cars is a bad idea.
