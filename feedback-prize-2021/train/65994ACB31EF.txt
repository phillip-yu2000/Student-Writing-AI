In my opinion it would benefit a students whom live by their own. The ones that came to this country by them self, the ones that must have to work full time or have two jobs, because they have job pay rent and others materials things that they must need every day to keep keep moving forward, as a result of working full time or having two jobs they would not have such enough time to attend any school. However if some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by access online without paying anything it will benefit a lot of students for example.

The students would be able to work all day long without having any fear of getting up early in the morning to came to school, whenever they have time such after work at night they can access online a take the classes. In addition more students would get graduated thanks to this program if it came up. Students sometimes get out of school, even if they don't want to do it,but they have the responsibility of the bills that they have to pay every month. If program exits, it will be successful for students.

As a result to this program teenagers from other countries would notice about this schools programs and they will have more reasons to be triumphant in having a better job. Unpleasantly they don't want to spend their hole life working at restaurants having they paid rate of $ 8.00 per hour, that's why this program will help students to create life's terms less stressful. They also will impact in a good way in the economy of the US.

In summary this program would impetuous and righteous for the generosity that they're giving to the students and the opportunity to have a lifestyle more easily. This option will become a great step for every teenagers that came to this country looking for better education and success them self.
