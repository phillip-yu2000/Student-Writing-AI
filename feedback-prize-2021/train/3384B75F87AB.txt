For years there has been a lot of controversy about the use of cellular devices while driving. People only tend to do it because they know they won't get caught unless they hold it up where it is visible.

Nobody should be allowed to use a phone while driving for any reason since it is very unsafe .As punishment they should get fined at least 500$ and get a tracker that doesn't let you use your phone while in driving motion.

Windows reflect whatever is on the outside so most of the time you can't see if someone is using a phone while driving. Texting while driving should be prohibited as it is a danger to themselves and to their society. It can lead to a car accident that could potentially get you killed.

1 in 4 accidents is caused by texting and driving making up a little over 300,000 crashes a year.

The minimum fine should be 500$ because eventually it adds up and people will realize that it isn't worth it. The tracker will prevent those who have already been caught texting and driving from using their phone. It will automatically alert the nearest officer. In general you shouldn't even glance at your phone because in a matter of seconds your life can flash right before your eyes. Now you're six feet under just because you wanted to text back or check a notification that wasn't even important and worth making you accidentally take your life.
