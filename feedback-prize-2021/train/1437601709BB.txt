Dear Principal,

I don't think cancelling sports and other school related activities unless the students have at least a B average is a good idea.

Students should be active and get exercise to live a healthy lifestyle, which is what's encouraged in health class.

Students will be happier this way.

Participating in sports and other after-school activities is a good way for students to express themselves.

Not to mention, it's a good way for students to spend time with people who share the same interests as them.

Students will be to shy to meet new people.

It's alright to be a little shy, but students won't be so open to meeting new people and trying new things without after-school sports and other activities.

this is because being involved in sports and other after-school activities is a good way for students to spend time with other students who may be interested in the same things as them.

There are a lot of important reasons why students should be allowed to be involved in sports and other after-school activities.

Please consider them.

Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
