Schools should require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during summer break . Summer projects should be student-designed because as a students i feel as if you know whats best for you also , students designing there own projects can get really creative and fun . Not all students can depend on there parents getting the supplies they need because some kids might be homeless or going through a lot right now with family issues . Students designed projects can be about what they do over the summer or how they spend there summer .

Teacher-designed projects can be sometimes difficult . Not all students understand Teacher-designed projects because they cant see it from a teacher point of view . When Teacher designed projects not all Teacher look at it as if some students need help in different strategies or , some students know more information then the other students . If anything Teachers should influence students to include pictures , colors , and details . I think summer projects should be students designed projects .
