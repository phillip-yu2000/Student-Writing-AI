The driverless car is the whole new way for the public transport .The car that can drive it self you won't have drunk or sleeping problem while they are driving.

If you have a driverless car that have bben control with the computer you will have less accident than what we have right now but what will happen if you get hack by the terrorist or that kind of people what can you do they can steal your car away really easy or they can kidnap you while you are riding the bus or they can do a car bomb without any chance to get hurt imagine what can the terrorist can hack to the main control system of the driverless car they can destroy every thing i will be a mess countless people will die the building and everything will get destroy and right now we don't have a way to protect the server from the hacker yet i want to know how can you prevent this thing from happening but if yo u can't you shouldn't do this at all don't put people live in to this kind of risk for your profit.

I didn't mention about people that will lose their job to these driverless car what can you do about this the money that they get and feed their family are you going to snatch their job away and let them starve to dead just so you can sell your driverlesss car.

By the way what will happen if your main computer that command your driverless car error or overheated is that mean all the traffic will be shutdown and you cannot do any thing until you fix that

The last thing i will mention about is the signal that you sent back and forth from the car to the gps or the controller how can you control the car when there is a place that got a bad signal right now some place you can't even get a good signal with wifi then how can you do that with all this driverless car system

I think their is to many problem to fix before you start this system you need to think about the people that work for the public trasnport and all the bad thing that will happen.
