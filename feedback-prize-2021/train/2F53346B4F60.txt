A new technologic advancement for reading emotional expressions of students would be a nice thing to have. Not all kids learn the same way as others do. When a kid is sitting in class and is struggling there might be something wrong but usually nobody asks to see if they can help.

Every kid has those days where they don't want to be at school and they are not in a very good mood. Teachers will be able to look at them ask whats wrong and then try to make the lesson a little different and easier to understand. When kids are better able to understand they will retain the information a lot easier and it will help them later on when they need to go back and remember what they have been taught.

Having computers that can recognize your facial expressions to help you learn would be a nice thing to have. In the world we live in today, there is technology everywhere you look and everywhere you go. In the school district I am in, every kid has their own MacBook and so we are always using technology for our school work. If the computers we used would be able to help us learn easier by telling our facial expressions then I feel like it would be a nice thing to have to help us learn and to succede in life.

Not just certain schools, but most schools around the world use electronics and computers. When you use the computer and get frustrated it would be nice if it could change the content of what you are doing to help you better understand what you are doing so you can learn it easier. With facial recognition with emotions would make it nice for the user and also make it a better learning tool for everyone to use.

Everyone has sat down at a computer and been frustrated on what they were doing but this could lower the frustration and make things easier for everyone. I do feel like this would be a nice thing to have in schools and that it would help kids and teachers out and that everyone would see a change in learning.
