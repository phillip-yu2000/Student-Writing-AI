Dear Principal,

I think cell phones should be allowed in school but not during class. Policy one is the one i agree with for many reasons. One reason is that phones can be a way for education. Now phones can go on the internet, and check your email. If the teacher asked for a certain thing in school and next hour was lunch. He/She would be able to go on the internet on their phone and find the information. Cell phones can also be a way to communicate if u need help in spare time. You could call up your friend and ask them for help if they are maybe in a different class. When the phones are off in class they do not create a disturbance to other people. So they do not get their cell phones taken away. It also can just help them if they needed a ride home because something came up. If you needed to stay after school for example, you could call your parents or a friend during lunch or spare time and then nothing to worry about. That is why I think cell phones should be allowed in school, but only during lunch or spare time.

Sincerely,
