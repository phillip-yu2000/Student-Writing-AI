Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe this idea you are considering is an outrage! Many people now at days are complaining about how overweight children are. If you were to take away these opportunities, the students would most likely become even more obese because a large amount of the school has a C average. You should not eliminate these programs from our school day because kids look forward to them. Can you imagine coming to school for eight hours out of a twenty-four hour day and doing nothing but work? Us kids would be brain dead, beat! Some students actually enjoy school the way it is, but if you were to change that I doubt any child is going to be jumping out of bed happy to be going to school. School is difficult for some students, including me. If you were to make it so that kids have to have a B average to participate in other things besides work they may feel as though they aren't smart enough to do anything well. TEACHER_NAME

I think it would be in the best interest to leave things the way they are!
