I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because the program is doing a good dead helping outhers in need when they most need it. Anouther good side of participating in this program is that you will see cool things go cool places like it said in the story you could go to China,over Seas,Greece,and Eroup. It would be fun and be for a good cause. To help people in need and to help many family's who lost there homes through war of there country and outhers. There would be danger going over seas chanses of falling over bord,cought in a storm, or even sea animal's. But it is all for a good cause to save outher peoples lives.

I know i would risk my life if im saving outhers because thats the kind of person I am. Luke did it so why not you,if you decide to join be brave,stand tall,and never be to scard to try! Luke is brave enough to do it and so are you. You know what people say you cant learn anything untill you try so why not you could do somthing incredible for this world and the people in it. Everyone can make a differance no matter who you are all you have to do is try. If you wont to take action this is a good opertunity!
