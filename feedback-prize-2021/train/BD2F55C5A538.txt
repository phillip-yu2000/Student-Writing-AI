The reason others should join the Seagoing Coboys is ,because you would be be able to expolore the world.

I say this ,because in paragrah four ,and five Luke Bomberger whent on 9

diffrent trips. luke had been to Europe,china,Acropolis: greece,and Venice:italy

.

Also if you love the ocean a Seagoing Cowboy is the job for you. A Seagoing Cowboy gets to see lots of the ocean. luke went across the paccific ocean twice. He also when across the the alantic ocean 16times. I found this information in the introduction obove the black line of paragrah 1.

Also if you fasinated ,and would like working with animals being a Seagoing Cowboy might be a job of your intreset.

I found in paragrah 2 that the(the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration)

URRA hired '' Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than the adventures its about being aware of the people and contries in need. This in luke Bomberger eyes is what is means to be a true Seegoing Cowboy. Information stated in paragrah 9.
