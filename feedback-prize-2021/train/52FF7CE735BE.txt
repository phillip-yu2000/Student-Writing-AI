First I think so because of the fact that people foccuse more on there friends then they do on there school work. Next i think not because some people are better hands on then working on there computers. Then I think so because of the fact that people don't like to come to school because there parents let them do what they want to do and they don't care how much work they have missed. Lastly I think so because of kids like to fight and mess up in class and get in trouble and miss out on school so they would be better at home.

First, people foccus to much about there friends then there school work,then they don't know what to do when a teacher ask them to do some then they be looking stupid in the face. Becuase they play around,and then when the time come to take a test or some there friends will pass but you won't .So you will be left behind and your friends won't be there for you to help you pass. They will sit there and laugh in your face like your dumb. But see if you at home and don't have nobody to mess you up or make you loss your foccuse you'll pass. Then at the end of the day you'll be up to grade with your friends and you dont have to worry about people laughing at you because you didn't pass your test. Last people thats say there your friends they really not your friends they just want to see you do bad,then when they pass they not going to care if you left behind they just going to keep going on with out you at the end of the day.

So thats why i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home.
