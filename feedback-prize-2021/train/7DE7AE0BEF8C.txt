Technology is a fast growing resource in the world today and the availability of such is quickly rising. In many schoools, technology is becoming an important aspect of everyday life. Not only does technology enable students to keep up with classwork outside of school and on days they do not attend but it also allows for more flexibility. If the technology that students use everyday had the ability to determine how they felt about certain lessons, then not only would it benefit them but it would benefit teachers as well.

Technology that can determine someones emotions was once thought to be a thing of the future but now that future is here. Professor Thomas Huang has been able to create a computer algorithm that determines human emotions by scanning their facial expressions. Imagine the possibilities with such software!! The most benefical area in which the computer algorithm could be used in is schools. '"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."' (Huang, Parahgraph 6) Not only would teachers be alerted when students were becoming distracted from their teachings, but they would also be offered suggestions on how to improve the lessons. Software such as the type that Dr. Huang has created could improve test scores across the nation and ease the workload of thousands of teachers. Why not use it?

Hence forth, technology that determines human emotions would be largely beneficial and effective for a large portion of the worlds population. Schools would experiance the most postive results from the software seeing as it would be able to adjust lessons to fit students learning curve and it would also reduce teachers workloads by creating lessons to fit students needs. The only negative aspect of Dr. Huangs software would be the cost of installation, but with the positive outcomes that would follow, whatever cost paid would be well worth it.
