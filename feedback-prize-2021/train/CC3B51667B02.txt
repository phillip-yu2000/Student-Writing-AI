Today, Jacob and Harley going to become Seagoing Cowboys. They're bothhaving second thoughts about going. I can't even get them to go to the Court House to sign themselves up. They need a job. They need to become Seagoing Cowboys.

"Come on, Jacob. You and Harley are going to love being Seagoing Cowboys. Just imagine see all of the beautiful sites and attractions in all the different countries in Europe and China." I said convincingly. Jacob just rolled his eyes. Harley sat quietly. "You'll see the Colleseum in Rome, the old Victorian Castle in Englnd, even the Parthenon in Greece." I said excitidly. That sparked their worn down brains. Harley sat up and Jacob leaned in to hear more. "The animals are so nice, too. You get tplay al of these fun games in the stalls when the animals are gone." Jacob spoke up. "But what happens if we get injured because of the war going on there? Won't the ship sink?" He looked concerned. I thought for a minute. "Don't worry," I said, " You'll be fine. Nothing bad is going to happen." Jacob and harley sat for a few minutes.

"We'll do it," They both said at the same time. Iwas so happy for them. "Great," I said happily. "Now, lets go down to the Court house to get you two boys signed up."
