Dear TEACHER_NAME,

You are considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average. My views on this possible change is that I think that the students should have at least a B average to participate in outer school activities such as sports. I say this because if a student wants to be a part of our school and wants to support our school, then they should have reasonable grades. In my house hold my brother and I are not allowed to get grades lower than a B. Students who want to do sports and activities should strive to make good grades. If you change the policy, then students may take education serious and start trying to achieve the grades to participate in sports. For example, if I did not have a goal or an expectation to reach, then I do not think my grades would be what they are today.

There is also one downfall for changing the policy. If you make the policy stricter than some students may not want to do sports and some students may become over weight. I hope you take my letter into great consideration and change the school policy so that students must have a B average to continue participating in sport activities.

Sincerely Your Student,
