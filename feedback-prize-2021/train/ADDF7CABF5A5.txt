Having more options to choose from is better than having one option.

One reason that multiple options are better than one is because you could get advice from people that have done something similar to what you are doing. This way, you could do something more easier or better because you got advice from them. Also, if they did something similar to you, you could learn from what they did to accomplish their task and take some steps they took to finish their objective and do something similar. Lastly, you would learn from the people that gave you advice since they have been through something the same or something similar.

Another reason that having more options are better is because you would have more options to choose from. This way, you would test the advice the people gave you and see what results you got. Also, having more options to choose from than only having one would be better because you would have more information with the wide variety of options than only one option which probably won't give you a lot of information. Lastly, having more options to choose from is better than just having only one option.

One last reason why having more options are better is because you could narrow down options that you don't like until you come across one you like. This way, you won't have to do something you don't like in fear of messing up, or failing your task. Also, you could take the options you have, and you test them to see if they come up with the results that you like instead of getting results that you hate. Lastly, you could root out options that people gave you that you think won't work, or don't like.Â
