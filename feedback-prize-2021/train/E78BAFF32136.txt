In Science Fiction movies you may have heard or seen driverless cars. Have you ever thought what it would be like to own a driverless car? Well in a few years that may be possible.

Many companies like Google, General Motors, and BMW have tried to make driverless cars. While many cars have been successful, none have been completely driverless. In some cases like work zones and where accidents are, a human driver must take control of the car in order to bypass the scene.

I think that driverless cars would be cool, but there is some danger to yourself and others without a person being in control. First, if the car were to switch to where a human takes control and the person was not paying attention then there would most likely be an accident. Second, if you were to learn how to use a driverless car you would have to learn how to drive first without a driverless car in case you have to take control of the car. Third, technology isn't perfect, there might be some isues with the first models of driverless cars and overtime the driverless cars will be fixed so that there will not be as many accidents because of a malfunction. Lastly, if you wanted to go somewhere you would have to program the car or use a GPS.

If there were driverless cars there would most likely be less car accidents in the future. Many accidents are caused by people driving faster or slower than the posted speed, drunk drivers, and having no experience by driving a car. If you were to elminate driving then there would be less car crashes.

In conclusion I believe that driverless cars would be a benfit to society by preventing most car crashes. However even if there are driverless cars the person controlling the driverless car needs to pay attention just like if they were driving the car. In the future, are you going to drive or let the car drive for you?
