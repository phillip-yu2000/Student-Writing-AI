I think the driverless car is a waste of time because of time because you do not even get a insure that your safe when you get in the car. In the text it states in most states it illegal to test compuer made cars. What driver would want to be in a csr thats not even tested to see if it does not shut down on commands or to notify if you are in danger of getting hit or close to backing up on a car.

The car can not even drive on its own around construction sites or around heavy traffic jams that what type of car people would buy without question. If the car can not move around or hit the brakes when your in serious danger than why even get it. Its jus a waste or your money and time and you can not inusre your safety.

The biggest thing that about the cars is you do not even know if you can sue the company for car failure. What if it just stop working and you hit someone than its going to be on you not the other person. The law might say it was on you for buying a car that was not tested but it was their design and if it could not be tested why are they on the street.

I believe the only the car good for giving your leg a rest from the peddle but that what we have cruise control for. The car is junk and have no need for people daily life and should not be out for a drive. alot of people will get hurt or worse for a untested car thats legal on the street.
