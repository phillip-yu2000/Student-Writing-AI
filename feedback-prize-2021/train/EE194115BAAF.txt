Dear Principal,

I think policy 1 would be best solution which is; students are allowed to have a cell phone not during class but only when its free time or lunch periods because there can be a problem In their house or somewhere else and they need to know as soon as possible.

They can only use It when Its free time And That's It. All Phones Should Be Turned Off While They Are In A Class.

If a student breaks the rule and gets caught with a cell phone then minis well pick policy 2 which Is; Students are not allowed to bring cell phones at all what so ever. Students can try if you give them a chance to try. students need their cell everywhere they go because anything can happen such as; there could be a fire in the school, or anything else that is tragic. Thanks for taking your time to read this letter .
