I think that asking for a B grade average is a little much to be able to play sports. C is called an average grade for a reason. B is above the average person.

Not everyone that plays sports has an above the average mind.

Most athletes can handle this but there are still some on the team that can't. Sometimes they have trouble maintaining a C average. Now where asking them to completely step up their whole report card? All this is doing is asking for trouble.

If we follow through with this, all they're doing is flunking more players off the sports team that they're on. This will lead to not having enough people to have a complete team. Not having enough people on a team can lead to many things. Examples are the couple that play will not get a break therefore they will be worn out and become exhaustingly tired. Then they will have trouble with the grades because they're so tired. Another is that they just won't even have the team anymore. This would make many students and parents sad and probably a little angry.

Now what we're trying to teach by doing this to the average people is to cram more. They will be so worried about a subject in school that they might forget another test that they have. This is going to distract them in their sport too. They will be so worried about making the grades so they can play that they won't be focused on the sport. Then they will start to fall behind. Then the coach will start to get mad at them for not being focused. If they start in their sport they could lose their spot because they can't focus on their sport.

What I am trying to come to is, that this is just a bad idea. Why do we want to change what we have being to for years all off a sudden? We need to just stick to what we have always done, a C average.
