I don't think we should make driverless cars. I think and feel like it would be dangerous and just end up bad. Humans should stay driving because we could be smarter than the driverless car when driving. Humans have common sense and

I dont think a driverless car would. How would the driverless car know how to move out of the way of a careless or dangerous driver.

If we did make driverless cars I dont think that most people would use them because of being scared. Anything could happen to the driverless car when driving. Something could go wrong with whatever helps the car drive on its own. It could just stop working and crash and kill that passenger. It could just loss control and just go out of control and kill. It says that most laws say that the all cars have to be driven by a human to be safe.

They should not make driverless cars. It could turn out bad and be dangerous. People could lose lifes in car crashes. We should just keep to what we have now and keep humans driving on their own.
