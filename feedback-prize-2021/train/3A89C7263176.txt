The elecotral college was a good solution many years ago to have a compromise between the election of President by Congress and to have the election of President by popular vote. Today, we have found flaws in the system.

To begin with, we fought many years to make voting right equal no matter your race, sex, or wealth. Shouldn't we keep that in mind, it would be more fair if everyone's individual vote counted. We shouln't have to let soemone vote for us. After we made this an equal country we should keep it that way.

In addition, some states have more people than others and if they only get a certain amount of voters not everyone really gets a say in the election. Therefor, if everyone gets their own vote the in the election the winner is truely who the citizens want to win. The number of electors can't make everybody in the state happy. Also, the "My vote counted" stickers you get after you vote aren't completly true in this system.

Next, we even have a name for what might happen... the disastor factor. You can't garuntee that the elector you vote for will elect who you want to really win. In this case you could elect oppent and not even realize it. If everyone's individual votes counted that would be solved, you know exactly who you are voting for.

In conclusion, the electoral college was a good idea many years ago. It made many years of voting easier but, now we see the flaws in it. The best way to elect the leader of our country is to have everyone have an equal vote.
