My argument is in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the U.S.A. This is because the Electoral College is unfair. The citizens are voting for the candidate's electors. The Electoral College is a process which consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is needed to elect the president. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a Certificate of Ascertainment. Which lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of the electors. This is sent to Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidetial election.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, agreed on abolishing the electoral college. They are not alone. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election.

Under the electoral collegen system, voters vote for the slate of elctors, who in turn elect the president. Sometimes the voters vote for the wrong candidate. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The biggest election crisis was in 2000.

So, it is official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The Electoral College depends more on the big states than on the small states.

My argument is in favor of abolishing the electoral college, because it is not fair that we vote for someone else and not the president.
