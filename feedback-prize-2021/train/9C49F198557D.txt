Dear School Principle,

I believe that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school and use them at lunch but they must be turned off at all other times.

I believe that cell phones are an important factor at school as long as they are used at appropriate times such as lunch and free periods, but they must be on silent or vibrate mode during the time they are allowed to be used so they don't disrupt anyone else working.

I think cell phones can be of great use in school because if a personal emergency with family occurred while a person is at school, a family member would have the first instinct to tell family, not have a message be relayed to a student by a teacher or principle.

If something were to happen to a member of my family, i would rather hear it firsthand than told to me by a teacher.

I think a student having his or her cell phone with them on a field trip or other class activity revolving around leaving the school or building is important.

If there were to be an accident or problem on the trip, each student would be able to call their parents or guardians to come get them or to call 911 to the scene, therefore, not every student must wait for one teacher who has their cell phone to use it one by one.

I think that a students cell phone can also be used as a way to make sure that they are doing what they are supposed to be doing and staying on track.

I believe this because if a student is not doing what is needed to be done, and instead playing on his or her cell phone, a teacher can take it away or not allow that specific student to use it again for a certain period of time.

In doing so, i believe cell phones are not only a way to have fun, but a way to ensure a students responsibilities in school.

Sincerely,

A Student
