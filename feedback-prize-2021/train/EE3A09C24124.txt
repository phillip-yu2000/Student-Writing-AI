If a school has a rule where the students have to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities; it could be beneficial for the students but at the same time it will depend on the students and how they want to spend their time. Also it could prove defective if the students feel too much pressure do to school work and the requirements needed for their specific activity. All in all it could also hurt the students sleep schedule and performance making them come in tired, with muscle cramps, fatigue etc.

In any case asking students to participate in extracurricular activities could help not just the students but also the school; if the students win first place in tournaments or championships the reward(s) from these events could prove useful not just to students but the school as well. It could also help the students by teaching them the value of others how to coordinate as a team along side with team building, public speaking, problem solving, and other helpful skills. Overall it could be a good strategy to teach students of all ages how to work together; combining all age groups could enhance students leadership skills.

although students could have positive impacts by this decision it could also have negative impacts; such as reducing students sleep time with homework they couldn't do because they were at practice. A lot of things could happen if a change like this came out of nowhere like students grades would go down they would pay less attention; students would be overwhelmed by the school work they have to complete and the time they have to separate for their extracurricular activity. After the students would come the school putting all employees out of work and leaving students uneducated.Â
