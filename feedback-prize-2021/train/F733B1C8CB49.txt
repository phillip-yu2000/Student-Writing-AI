In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" should there be driverless cars? There are a lot of negative and postive things about this movement. My opion on driverless cars is that sometimes it could be good and sometimes is could be bad like for an example. when your very tired and you need to go somewhere your car can take you were you need to go without you having to drive it. If you are ever in a hurry your car can drive you without you being late.

Now for my opinion on the bad things about driverless cars. Driverless cars are also bad because you could be texting and you would'nt here your alert that the car gives you when it can drive at that certain part in time and you end up crashing into something or hurting someone. This means a human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.

I think that driverless car would be a good experiment because we would be able to see who could handle it and who can't handle it. Some people might think that they can handle it and they go and bye a driverless car and go to start it and dont no what to do but the other half would no what to do right off bat. I also think that the car would be more expensive than any car that has ever been made because if what it does this car is basically the future.

But why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver half of the time? Well i guess ill tell you why. Most of the people think that it would be fun sometimes because not often you get to drive a driverless car its interesting in my opinion. But in a way the car system is really a saftey system if you pay attention to what all that you are doing but if you don't it could be hazert.

Most of the driving laws focus on keeping people safe but what is you arent the one who crashed who's to blam? Traffic laws will even change new laws will need to be reinforced. If you crash into someone who also has a driverless car who crashed into who.
