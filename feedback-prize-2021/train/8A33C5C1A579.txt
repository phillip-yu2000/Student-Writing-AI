I think that students should have at least a C average to participate in sports or other activities. Even though students should have a good grade point average they might have trouble with keeping up with balancing their sports time with studying for school.

I personally have a hard time coping with my homework and sports. practice does take a lot of time and energy, but kids don't always want to stay up all night study for a test or doing homework that isn't important to them. If they don't want to try then they can learn a better way then getting kicked off a team because they don't have a B average.

I think that teachers should limit the homework assignments to a reasonable amount. Students shouldn't have to spend all of their time doing homework and going straight to practice. Maybe if a teacher handed out packets that were always due at the end of the week and were graded for correctness students would try harder and not procrastinate till the last minute because they "had a busy schedule last night." Kids might even think that they're too stupid for playing sports because they might not remember plays that easily or know how to do a certain combination. Having a C average isn't that bad if you at least understand the content your supposed to, I have a B average and I still don't understand things perfectly or get good grades on all of my tests.

Seventh and eighth grades are very hard to keep up with all of the activities and schoolwork. When high school comes around I think that we should have a good idea of our schedules and when we should study or practice for the big game.

Schoolwork is also very important but kids also need time to themselves.

Schoolwork and other activities are very stressful to balance out and I don't think that many adults realize that at all. Kids need time to themselves to relax and not be taken over by overwhelming schoolwork and sports.
