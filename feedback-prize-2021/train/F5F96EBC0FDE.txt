Why would you want to join the program Seagoing Cowboy? One reason is it's a one in the lifetime opportunity. You also help countries recover the countries' belongings. The fun part is you get to travel around the world, and visit a variety of places! Wouldn't you like to travel around the world and help countries?

I know I would enjoy being in the program.

Luke Bomberger helped recover food supplies,animals and much more. 44 other nations joined a group called UNRRA. The Seagoing Cowboys were taking care of animals. Luke had made nine trips in1947, it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy! Luke thought it was unbelievable for a small-town boy!

He felt special helping people and animals, an seeing countries. How would you feel? It must have been busy for Luke caring for animals! Taking care of animals is hard work ,imagine taking care of 15 or more!

Would you enjoy taking care of many animals? When Lukewatchman duty and it had been rainy so it was slippery Luke had slipped and fell he had cracked his ribs and couldnt work for a few days. When they unboarded they played many games and sports. Luke was more aware of other countries and needs.

I think it would be fun to be a Seagoing Cowboy and help countries. would you want to? Helping Countries is very special and i would do it.
