When it comes down to air pollution cars are one of many the factors that lead to air pollution. The pollution made by cars could start smog to build up in major cities and suburband areas. This can become a major factor in many other developed countries. There is one way we could put a end to this and that is to limit car use.

There are countries all over the world that are starting a new trend in order to limit the use of cars. The trend they are starting is a car less suburb wich bans all cars from the community. This method is better because they build things in walking distance so there is no need for car use. This is a good way of reducing the air pollution and also a good way in saving money. this is a great move for the poeple who are jobless so they wont have to spend money on a car or gas. These suburbs are a good place to live because the air is less polluted and you save money.

This movement is also starting in major cities such as Paris and Bogota. Paris was one of the most polluted places in Europe until motorist with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave thier cars at home and the same would apply to the odd numbers the next day. As the days went on the smog in the air had reduced and also the traffic had dropped. In Bogota motorist were also orderd to leave thier cars home. When the people were orderd to leave the cars at home  they started to ride bikes and carpooling to get to thier destination. The other countries saw how this helped car pollution and traffic jams they started to ban cars as well.

This movement has vehicle makers to start changing the way they make thier cars due to these events. This new trend has redudced the air pollution majorly and the use of traffic jams have dropped. If they continue with this car banding the world would be a less polluted place and people would save money and live better.
