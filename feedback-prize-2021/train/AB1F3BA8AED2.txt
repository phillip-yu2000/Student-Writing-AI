Dear principal,

I am writing u this letter to tell u why i think that u should let students with a B grade average play sports or any other activities they wish to be in. Because even though they might be struggling in school or on that one subject they just cant get right dose not mean that they cant be in any extra activities that they wish. And if they are struggling then they should try and get help or if they are already in a sport or activities, they u shouldn't kick them off the team or out of that class because the work is too hard and they don't under stand how to do it. You should just try and get them help so they can stay in the activities they are in. But if they need help and they are not saying anything or don't seemed concerned about there graded then you can let them be on there own and not help them if they don't want help or if they think they are too good to be help or they are just like "oh well its just on grade it wont take any affect to my grade average." And then it does then they are trying to get some extra credit to make up for that work. When they thought they were too good for anything. And they should be kicked out of those activities if they do there work but have bad behavior . And that's what i think.
