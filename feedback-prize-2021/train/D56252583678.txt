I agree because everyone should at least participate in a extracurricular activity alot of people like doing afterschool activitys and if everyone tries to participate maybe they will find an activity they like. Some people like sports some people like to draw if you participate you will be able to have fun and enjoy what sport you play like basketball its fun and your able to use team work to win or drawing it takes time but at the end you drawed a pretty picture or helping around the school help with the family market or or clean up a classroom with a teacther its so much things you can do you just have to particicpate or if you like to cook theres clubs and programs for u to cook of is you like to graden there a club for that or even if you just want to play games or video games with your friends theres clubs theres alot to do. You can can ask the people who run or is the boss of the afterschool programs you can ask to makes a club or something you like to do like hair and nails that will we a program i will join because thats what i want to do when I get older or some people will join to see if thats what they want to do when they get older some people might like fasion or some might like music its whatever you like to do you should do it just start to do more extracurricular activity.

There can be more than one activity you will like to participate in so for each day you can sigh up for the activity u want to do for that day or even if your not into sports or drawing or gardening try if you try you might like it always take try something before you say I don't like it.
