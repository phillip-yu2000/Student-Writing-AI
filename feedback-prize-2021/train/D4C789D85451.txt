Dear Principal,

Many have noticed your idea to bring the grade, to participate in sports and other activities, to B average instead of keeping it at a C. I, personally, am against it. One thing I would like to point out is a B grade stands for above average and C stand for average. If you bring the participation grade to a B you will probably lose a lot of the students because of their grade. Losing students will most likely reduce the amount of players on the football team which will decrease school pride. This is probably just an old wives tale, but I have heard that if your school has a lot of school pride, crime rate, in school, goes down. People would actually be proud to be at this school. Those that are C students may be discouraged at that fact that you have set the bar above them and believe that they will never reach that level. This may bring down their grades and set them off course of a college degree. Now I plead with you, think through this idea before you accept it. Thank you.

Sincerely,
