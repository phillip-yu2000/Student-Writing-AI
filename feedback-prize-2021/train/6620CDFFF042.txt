Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I am aware of the your dilemma about the cell phone policy. i think you should let the students use their cell phones during free times such as lunch time and other free times. i believe that was your first choice. i think that's the best choice because schools have such a tight grip over students these days since they don't have recess anymore (middle school& high school kids) I think we should let them us cell phones during free periods. If their parents loosen the leash at home who are we to tighten it up here. plus if we don't let students have theirs cell phones at school what if their was an emergency when they have to call their parents or the police or someone of importance and we cant reach them because the don't know the number and picks up. so theirs know reason we should stop the kids from bringing the cell phones to school so. so i strongly agree with the first choice.

i hope you take this into consideration thank for your time
