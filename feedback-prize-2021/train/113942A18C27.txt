If i had to choose it would be policy 2 because while im in class someone is always on there phone and they are not paying attention and if there are no phones aloud no one would be texting and there is a better chance that they will pay attention because they wont have anything to do but work because i have seen it myself the teachers catch's the student on there phone and they start paying attention just so the student can get the phone back. Also some students would say if they didn't have a phone how would their parents call if there is an emergency that is why it makes it an hard decision that why phones should placed in lockers and if there is an emergency parents should be made sure to immediately call the office asap so that would be my way of there are reasons to support both but ultimately i would pick policy 2.
