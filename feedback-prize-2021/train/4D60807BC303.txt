Computers can read your mind?! No, not really, but they can tell how you're feeling. A new technolagy created by Dr. Thomas Huang, allows computes to read your facial expresions. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how this new technology can be valuable. This technology that we can use to read students emotinal expressions would be valuable.

Because of the students facial expression, the computer can tell if the student is confused from a lesson in class. In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," Dr. Huang predicts "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson". If the computer could understand when the student is having a problem and can effectively fix that issue, then this could be the best way to teach. The use of reading students emotional expressions is valuable, because they can be taught better.

eventhough it may not seem praticle to use this technology, students can actualy learn from it. "the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D comuter model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles... Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS(Facial Action Coding Sytsem) has classified six basic emotions -happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles". Eckman's technology has a lot of information studets can learn. The technology is valuable because the students that use it can learn and better understand diffrent facial expresions made by others.

The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions is valuable. it can teach students about other facial expressions, or whatever they are learning in class. With the help of this new technology we can ensure students to have better grades go to better schools, and in the end make the world a much smarter and better place.
