Have you ever been to Mars? Well neither have I and studies show that it is a great experience. There people who have different opinions about what is on Mars.

Some scientist say that on the planet Mars that there was a face created by aliens. Those people do no evidence which makes it hard to believe. They chose to believe what an magazine article, hollywood films, books, and radio talk shows knew what is was that they were talking about. They believe it ws a face from someone who had once been on Mars. They believe in multiple things but in fact do not have valuable information, or proven facts.

On the other hand, scientists think that the face was not brought by aliens but in fact just a rock formation. They fortunately do have more valuable facts and information. NASA has been able to prove that the face was indeed not brought from aliens but, "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West." They have porven that it is just a natural landform. How? Taken from the text it says," the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa" - whcih are landforms common around the American West.

In conclusion, it has yet to be proven by actual authorities the scientists are still not sure about whther it is a face created by aliens or a natural landform. But there ar indeed facts that shows that it was not created by aliens but a natural landform but surely the other scientists will not give up on what they believe to have been created by aliens. There are still people who have different opinions based on things on this earth.
