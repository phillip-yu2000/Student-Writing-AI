Essay 2: Phones & Driving

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because, that's a detraction on the road. If you have kids in the car and you texting while driving and you do not pay attention to the road and your coming on to a traffic light and it's red a car is in front of you, and then you hit the car you could kill you and your kids just from that one big detraction on the road. Say if you lived and you kids died you are going to jail and you have to go to court to pay the people who you hit from behind that one mistake could lead to all of that. Anything can and could put your family in risk and you in risk for your life. You're driving in your car so someone who you know or love text you. A person walking across the road you're not paying attention at all you hit them they lived lucky lived when you hit them, so they stay in the hospital a good 2-3 weeks the police come to the hospital convince the person you hit to sue you they do it. In the mail or the police that convince they person that you hit come to your house and tell you that you have been sued for texting and driving on the road because the traffic lights has a camera on it catches you. Your court day comes up either your license get suspended or you have to pay the person you hit money. It might end up as both. This why people should not text & drive.
