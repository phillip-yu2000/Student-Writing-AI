Dear Principal :

They must earn their participation in any sports or any activities without a B average.

I think you are right about not letting kids without a B average participate in any sports or any activities . I work hard for the grade I

get. If I work harder than most people ,how come we both get the same rewards . I think that because I work harder . Also because the better you are the better rewards you get.

My first reason is if I work harder than most of the students here then why do we get the same rewards ? I you were to work 92 hours and someone else worked only 24 , do you think you should get the same amount of money at the end of the week ? So I get an A or B yet someone else gets a D or C why would we get the same rewards ?

My last reason is if I am a behaved student with good grades while someone else is un behaved with bad grades why would we get the same treatment ? I get A' s or B ' s but someone else gets D' s why would we both be able to do something fun ? It wouldn't be fair .

That was my last reason .

So those were my reasons for why only good grade students should get rewarded and not graded students . Again they were : if I work harder than most why do we both get the same reward ? And if I'm good with good grades while someone else has bad grade while being bad they should not have the same treatment as me .
