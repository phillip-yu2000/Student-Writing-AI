Dear, principal I am a student of our school. I think that its unfair that every student has to do community service. Some students like doing it but other students don't. The student who don't want to the community service may have different plans with other people and doesn't have the time to do it, every kid has the right to choose whether or not they want to do community service. No one can make them do what they don't want to do. we the student of this school do not have to perform community service if we do not choose to. For example we have some very important business to take care of with our parent and we have to get home as quick as possible. we have to go home and so we don't have the time, or we just don't want to. In conclusion we the kids of this school shouldn't have to do community service if we don't want to.
