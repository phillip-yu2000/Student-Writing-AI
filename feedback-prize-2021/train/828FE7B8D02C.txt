People make hard choices every day, and sometimes they don't know what to do. Advice from other people can be helpful to you in so many different ways. Such as, other people have personal experience that you might not have, sometimes you dont know what to do and other people can tell, and having input from a lot of people can give you options on what to do.

Other people having personal experience that you dont have can be helpful. They can give you suggestions on what to do. People say that experience is the best teacher. If that is the case then wouldn't it make sense to take advice from other people, that have personal experience that you dont have.

Sometimes you dont know what to do, and your just confused. Other people can sometimes understand the situation better than you can, and help you though it. Because sometimes you dont have all the answers. Other people can also be more calm than you in certain situations, and therefor make the better choice.

Having input from a lot of people can be very helpful in many situations. They can also give you choices on what to do in hard situations. Sometimes you dont know what to do and other people can make the choice for you taking off a lot of stress.

Taking advice from other people can be helpful, it can give you more options, other people can have personal experience that you dont have, and sometimes you dont know what to do and others can make the choice for you. But only you can make the final choice on what to its your life after all. Nobody knows you better than you know yourself, for nobody has been though exactly what you have been though.
