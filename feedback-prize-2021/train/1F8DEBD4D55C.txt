My position on driverless cars is that we shouldnt have them. The excess money that their spending to make these car we could be spending on something more important. Driverless cars will be expenssive so many people coulnt afford them.

We shoulnt have driverless cars because at any moment they could maulfunction and could wreck. Since their driverless who would be at blame when you wrecked the computer or the person in the car? We would have to put so much money into changing the roads so the cars would work. Road work would have to be minumised so that we wouldnt have to touch the wheel at any point.

My final statement is that no we shoulnt make them because of all the money that will be wasted on making them and roadwork. We would be saving money and they wouldnt be losing money because only people that are rich could afford a car like this and people that cant would just be left out of the whole thing.
