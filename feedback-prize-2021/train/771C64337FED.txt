Do you really want a machine that tells you how you feel? If so why would you want a machine telling if you know how you feel like. These type of technology is not good and theres no need in having it mostly not in a classroom or school where anything could happen to it if you not carefull.

I dont think this technology should be used in school or in a classroom. Those machies and technology will coast alot and theres no need in having one in the classroom. No one would really use is and who willl really pay for one. If a kid plays around with it who will pay for it and theres no class that needs it. If you want one in your home you cant becuase your PC cant haddle it. in the text it states "Your home PC cant handle the complex alogorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile" meaning you will have to buy a better PC just to used the technology. The only thing it does is seeing how you feel. Its not gonna solve nothing or help its just gonna tell you how your feeling and no one know 100% if its always right. They tested on a painting and the person for the painting Mona Lisa is not live to say oh thats correct. Also it tells you how to look in the mirror so it can see how your feeling meaning you cant have or make your normal face becuase it wont work.

Its not god becuase how can it split all the feelings like that so this type of technology should not be in schools or homes. No need in wasting your money on the technology when you could get something better and maybe not as high in price becuase it didnt say how much it is and what type of computer you need so it could work.
