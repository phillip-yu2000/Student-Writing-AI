Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard that you were reconsidering our cell phone policy and i truly believe that policy one is the best option regarding our cell phone policy. I believe policy one is the best decision because it is the year of 2011 and us students practically live off of technology. Cell phones are the only way that we communicate in our society. If cell phones are turned off during class periods then i do not see a problem. Having cell phones during free periods give us the opportunity to get in contact with our parents if needed. Sometimes after school activities are cancelled and then everyone has to go through the hassle of using your teachers phone in order to contact your parent. But if everyone had a cell phone on them during their free periods or lunch, then this would immediately eliminate the problem.

Another reason why I think that policy one is the best way to go is because some phones have internet access. Internet access can help us with our studies and finding information for a research project or a homework assignment. Although there are computers during free period, sometimes you are unfortunate and all the computers are being used. If we were aloud to use cell phones then more people would be able to get their work done during school. The last reason why i feel policy one is effective is because you can communicate with kids easily. Sometimes your friends do not have all the same classes with you and you maybe be in one class and they may be in another class somewhere across the school. If you have something important to tell them then you would have to search for them, but with cell phones you can easily just text them the important news. If you choose to pick policy one for our new cell phone policy, not only will you be making us kids the happiest kids ever but also you will be helping us a lot as you can see.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
