Dear editor,

I think its fair for you to have at least a B average to participate in any sports at school, because if the students participate in any sports activities there not going to want to do there work at school because they would be to focused on the sport than they would there school work they wouldn't get any of there work done. I think a B is good enough because you still passing.

i think school is way more important than sports, because with out school you wont have a good education, sports is good but that's not really going to get you anywhere in life. If a student really wants to participate in any sports activities and they have a C or lower they should do something about it and ask the teacher if they can do anything to improve there grades like extra credit.

That's what i did when i was on the wrestling team my coach was about to kick me off the team because my grades were dropping to C and D but i asked my teacher if i could do anything to fix it and they gave me all of my old test and class work i didn't do so well on and let me try everything again, i brought up most of my grades and my couch said it was good enough, if you really want something you should do whatever you can for you to succeed and to get what you need.

the teachers are not trying to be mean they just want you to have a good education and be smart, i totally understand why the teachers make us bring up are grades or wont let us do anything until all our grades are good enough,
