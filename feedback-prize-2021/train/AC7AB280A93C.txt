Students won't benefit from being able to attend school from home. Students will slack and become less responsible if they are home school.

Students tend to postpone work and project since there isn't a teacher physically in front of them constantly reminding them "do your work" or "heads up this assignment is due next week."

Although some may say students benefit more being home schooled they won't because they will get comfortable. Students will have the sense that they can do the work whenever they want , so therefore they won't complete the assignment. Students will later find all the amount of assignments that have to be complete will increase the student will feel overwhelmed then later fail, quit , and drop out.

School prepares you for the real world. They take in consideration attendance and responsibility. For instance a job as well requires these characteristics. If your home school your not training yourself or the mindset to adjust to being responsible. Home school will make someone ,less responsible since they got into the habit of being comfortable and not responsible.

In conclusion students won't benefit from being able to attend school from home. Students will slack and become less responsible.
