Would you ever dream of a taxi cab that has no driver and can drive you around? Google is making cars that require no drivers. Although this is a very neat idea, it is extremely expensive. This idea would work if all of America was urban land and not so many non urban areas. I think driverless cars are one of the biggest wastes of money we have came up with so far.

Driverless cars seems like a good idea and all but i dont think it is necissary. All it does is cost more and more money that does not need to be spent. We would have to buy sensors for all highways across the world which would be extremely expinsive. This is money we do not have and we dont need to spend money on this anyways.

Experts say that the will need roads that are embedded with electrical cables. We also thought of the idea of magnetic roads, but to have magnetic roads that make our cars work we would have to do massive upgrades to our highways. But this is too expensive, so we have to make the cars smarter rather than the roads. To do this we need tons of sensors, a rotating sensor on the roof, and a GPS reciever. All of these also costing a whole lot of money.

Making driverless cars is a bad idea in my opinion, but if experts are set on making them then they probably will. Driverless cars will cost us an enourmous amount of money. They will need to heavily modify highways, cover the cars in all sorts of sensors and cameras, and test them thousands of times to make sure they are safe. If taking all this time and money is worth it to the experts, then let them do it. But we need to be smarter with our money rather than wasting it on senseless things such as, driverless cars.
