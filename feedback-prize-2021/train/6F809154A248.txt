Have you ever wanted to help people during war without joining the military well you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. The Seagoing Cowboys program is where you get on a boat with other people and go to far places to get animals.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good way to help other country so there country's people can survive after war and other causes. On the Seagoing Cowboys program you can meet new people, and see new places and structures. You can also take animals from one country to another to give one country animals so they can make food so they all don't starve.

Just like Luke Bomberger who was just a average town boy then he joined the Seagoing Cowboys program because his friend then he became a hero.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was created by the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). The UNRRA was created during World War 2 in 1945 to help country's effected by World War 2 by destruction. The UNRRA helps by getting soldiers to help fight. They also search for food and animals. The Seagoing Cowboys program helps by getting horses,young cows, and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys program headed to Greece with a cargo of 335 and enough hay and oats to feed them.
