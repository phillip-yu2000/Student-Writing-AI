Why would seeking multiple opinions about advice on something help someone make a better choice? They might see things from other peoples perspective, or get more options when choosing the better choice. In the next few paragraphs, you will find how multiple opinions could be helpful when asking for advice.

Different points of view. Most people have a different perspective about everything. When asking for advice, you will most likely get a different response from each person. Seeking a number of people for advice could help you get a better understanding on how that person sees your "problem". It could also help you on making a better decision.

Multiple or different choices. Sometimes it's difficult to make a choice on things, you may be an indecisive person. If, or when you seek multiple people for advice, you get a different response from them. That will give you different options to choose from when choosing what or how to handle it. When you have multiple choices, you could always narrow them down to the choice you think is best. Making it easier to decide.

How to handle or deal with it. It can be frustrating when asking for advice. Sometimes peoples answers may be unhelpful, or might make the thing your asking about worse. Seeking out different people to talk to can help with that. Some of their responses might be helpful, others might not. If most peoples answers are helpful, you could choose the person who gave the most helpful advise, and go with their answer. That might help you deal with or handle the situation.

In conclusion, seeking out multiple opinions on advice can be helpful at times. You might never get good advice out of anyone, leaving you to give yourself advice. In my own opinion, I think it gives you a wide variety when choosing what to do. Which could guide you to making a better decision.
