Our principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. This is a really good idea because, there are people who never thought of going to an extracurricular activity. They will really enjoy their time because they chose the best activity for them. In addition, the students will learn new and useful stuff that they never knew before. For an example, if the student decides to work on the yearbook he or she will really enjoy and learn how the yearbook functions.

There are students who never thought of going to an extracurricular activity. The causes can be if they didn't get enough information, peer pressure, and lack of interest or lack examples due to the student not caring enough or searching enough. The principal is helping students to find their best interest.

Most likely the reason students don't know or care because of the lack of information. Due to the principal bringing this new rule, it will cath students' attention and will make them search and realize the different type of extracurricular activities. That way the students will choose the best activity for themselves and get to have a great time. This will ease off the stress from their classes and will release what's on their mind.

In addition, the students learn new and useful stuff they never knew before. An example would be a student working on the yearbook and learning how yearbooks function. They will learn how to take photographs, how to design, edit, and even the students names. This may help them in their future if they ever want to work on a yearbook or something similar.

In conclusion, this will help students learn about extracurricular activites and how they work, finding their best interests and what they can and will like to do, learning new knowledge of their best interestsm, and clearing their minds on their classes. This all will help students to become better individuals.
