When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. Sometimes people ask for advice from other people to get their opinions, for example it helps find your decision, how to execute your decision, and to know what to do afterwords. It is good to get other peoples opinions so do not be scared to ask.

The first thing getting other peoples opinions helps with is finding your decision. It helps finding your decision by finding what you agree with. Finding out what your going to do is the most important thing to do. When someone asks you for advice don't give them bad advice, because the situation could be very important.

The second thing getting advice from more than one person helps with is figuring out how your going to execute your decision. This is somewhat important depending on the situation. When going through with the decision if it could hurt the person let them down easy. When figuring out how to deal with the problem go with what you feel is right not just what other people say.

The third and final thing on my list is finding out what to do afterwords. This isn't as important as the other two things. Depending of if the situation is family or friends changes the level of importance. When you execute the choice don't get depressed and turn to drugs or alcohol turn to your friends who always have your back.

sometimes it's good to talk to other people for advice not just one person. people ask for advice from multiple people to help find their decision, how to execute the choice, and to know what to do afterwords. people who are sensitive need better advice than others and a shoulder to lean on after they do it. this was my opinion on what the subject was on. I wrote this to give some people advice on what to do when they themselves or friends/family are going through something.
