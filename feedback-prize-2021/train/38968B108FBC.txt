Imagine you are trying to make the biggest decision of your life. Would you ask friends and family for advice? It could help you decide or even just narrow down your options. Asking multiple people for advice when making a decision can help you pick a better choice because it can make choosing easier, you could find a new, better option, and people can share their experiences and wisdom with you.

First off, getting advice from lots of people will make it much easier when making your decision. Hearing other people's thoughts and opinions can effect the whole way you think about the situation. When asking one person, they could totally disagree with you and advise the opposite option you had in mind. Somebody else you ask could agree with the first person, and now you think, "Well, maybe this is the better decision." For example, say you want to eat out, but eating at home sounds good too. So, you talk to two friends and they give you reasons on why you should just eat at home. So by getting their advice, you made your decision much easier.

Next, someone could recommend a stronger choice compared to the ones you had. Picture this, your asking a few people for advice on a debate you have and someone mentions a completely different option that was much better than the others. Now, you can choose that option and be better off than if you had picked the other options. This is similar to a time when I was younger, I couldn't decide whether I wanted to play football or basketball. So, I asked my relatives. Some said I should play football, others said I should play basketball, but a few of them said baseball. I had never even thought of that idea, but now, it's my favorite sport!

Last, people are very wise and can share that with you to help make you decision. Some of the people you talk to might have already been in the situation you are in. They can give you information on which paths to take based on their past experiences. Say you wanted to go on vacation, but couldn't decide between the beach or the mountains. You talk to one person who has been to the beach and they tell you why the beach is a good place to go. Then, you talk to a different person and they say why the mountains are a good place to go. Based on what they knew, it was easier to make the better choice.

Finally, when making a decision, asking multiple people helps you make the right pick by making it easier to decide, finding a new, better option, and getting other people's wisdom. So by asking around, you'll be able to make the best choice possible. Next time you have a tough decision to make, ask around and hear what multiple people have to say before making your pick.
