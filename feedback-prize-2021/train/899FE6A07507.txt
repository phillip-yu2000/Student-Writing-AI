In my position, driverless cars is something I am against and something that I will not use in the future. I am against the idea of driverless cars because of many specific reasons. There is also the joy of learning how to drive and learning from our mistakes on driving. Maybe someone wants hack your car and it will just stop out of no where. There are also good reasons to have a driverless car for you to own. Those are some reasons I have on why I am against or with driverless cars.

Somewhere there is always a person that wants to do or cause bad things. Maybe this person wants to stop all the cars from working while they're in traffic. They can also cause a crash with 2 or more cars. Then people would just end up in the hospital. There is always a person like that, so that is one reason why I against driverless cars.

There are also good reasons to have a driverless car for you to own. Maybe you're in an accident and you need to get to a hospital and you can't drive, well then you can have your driverless car drive for you. Someone may have a child on board and they might need a diaper change or they need something, well you can help your child while your car drives for you. Say you're about to crash and your driverless car saves you with the sensors it has. There are some good reasons to have a driverless car as well.

In conclusion driverless cars is a no for me but there is also good reasons. Such as a hacker, hacking your car ans making you crash and ending up in the hosptial. There is a good reason too is for when you're in accidents. Last is the joy of learning and driving a car. This is why I am against driverless cars.
