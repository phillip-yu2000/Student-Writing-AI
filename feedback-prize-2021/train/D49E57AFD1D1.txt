Changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average is a good idea because it would make the students who do play sports and activities work harder in school. If I was the principal I would do the same thing because it would be the best thing for the students playing sports or other activities. I play sports, but the first thing I think about is doing good in school because it's more important than playing sports or other activities.

Therefore, before I go to practice for wrestling I make sure my homework is done and is ready to hand in. I pay more attention to my grades than sports because it will take me further in life and I will be more successful. Also It would make students keep their grades up if they want to play sports because if they don't keep their grades up they will not be able to play any sports. I think you should change the schools policy so that students who do play sports or other activities should keep their grade up to at least a B average because it would be best for the students and for their grades.

I like this rule because it's what's best for the student and it's more important in life for them to do good in school than to play sports. I hope you keep this rule because its whats best for the students and for their grades and it will help them later in life.
