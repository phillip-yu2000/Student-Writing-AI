The Electoral College. A process not a place. The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of Presidents. It works by a popular vote by qualified citizens. I am aganist the Elctoral College because it is unfair to voters and the voters don't vote for the Presidant they vote for the slate of electors.

Why is it unfair to the voters? Now it's unfair to the voters because of the winner take all system. Candidates don't spend time in states they knoiw they have no chance in winning, so they foucs on the "swing states" In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't get spoken to by any candidates at all. If anyone has a argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio.

Voters dont vote for the President. They vote for the slate of electors. Electors are and can be anyone that deosn't hold a postion in a public office. Now we the people dont pick the electors in the first place. Depending on the state, sometimes the state party's central committee choose, sometimes the presidential candidates choose them self. Voters can sometimes contorl whom their electors vote for, but not all the time. Sometimes the voters get confused about the electors and they go off voting for the wrong candidate. To me that's un-fair to the voter because they are not voting for the presidant but for an a elector that can mess up and vote for the wrong candidate.

So concludeing to me claim, I'm aganist the Electoral College because it's unfair to the voters ts's self and that the voters dont vote for Presidants, but for electors.
