Dear Principal,

I have considered the two policies on cell phone usage. The first one is, students should be allowed to use cell phones during lunch and passing periods. As long as they stay off during classes. The second policy is, students won't be able to have cell phones at school at all. While they both have their advantages, I think one of them is better than the other.

Some advantages of the first policy is that they can call who they need to, in case of an emergency. What if I forgot to bring my lunch? What would I do? During the passing period between second and third period I would call my mom to bring my lunch. What if I forgot to tell my dad that there is no practice today? Then, I would call my dad at lunch and tell him that there is no practice. That advantage would help me a lot.

Some advantages to the second policy is that there would be no more cell phone interruptions in the classroom. I don't like it when I am working or trying to listen to instructions and a cell phone goes off. It makes me mad. But, the second policy would get rid of that. So now, when I am taking a test, there will be one less interruption. The second policy would make classrooms more peaceful.

In my opinion, I think that the first policy is better. First off, if we got rid of cell phones, a lot of students would complain. Then, they would still try and use them during school. After, they would get caught and have their cell phones taken away. Now, they will complain more. Also, there would be more students without lunches and more students waiting a long time for their parents to pick them up. That would cause a lot of trouble.

That is my opinion. The first policy allows you to call in case of an emergency. The second policy makes it easier to think and follow directions. But, the second policy would get more students in trouble. That is why I chose the first policy.

Sincerely,

Student number 5
