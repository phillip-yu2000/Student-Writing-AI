People seem to think that the rock on mars was created by aliens but sienctist disagree. At first scientists figured that the face was just nother martian mesa, common enough around cydonia, only this one had unusaul shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh. In the article it states that a couple of days later they saw the huge rock formation which looked like a humans head but really it was the form of the shadowns that created the rock looked like it had eyes, nose, and even a mouth. The rock was not created by aliens it just was a formation of the rock and diifrent shadows but lots of people seem to like it. Scientists know that the rock really was just made like this and know aliens did not create this this rock. But some people believe other things on how this rock some how looks like a face.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. But there were people who still believed that aliens did this and that the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.
