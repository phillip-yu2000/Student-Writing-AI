To whom it my concern;

I believe that students should be able to use their phones at school only during their free periods. This is because this nation of ours runs on using their cellular devices. Also most use their phones to call their friends, family, and other such people. In addition people use their phones to plan activities after school or to contact their parental figure to find out if their friends would be able to come over to their house after the school day is over.

First students use their phones to contact their friend and family. For example students call their parents to see if a friend could come over and hang out. Also phones are used in the case of an emergency like a fire of earthquake. This shows that phones are a good thing and are therefore capable of being aloud at school. As a result we use our phones for many reasons.

Second phones help students to be organised. For example phones have calendars on them which are good for planning events and making plans for after school. Also they can set ring tones that can alert you if you're late to an appointment. This shows that phones are not only good for getting in touch with people but also are good for organisation. As a result phones help to make people more sufficient.

In closing students should be able to use heir phones at school, because it helps to plan the rest of their day and other events as well. Also phones should be aloud at schools because of their safe nature. This is important because if phones are not aloud at schools then all students would be running around like chickens without heads. As a result phones should be aloud at school.

Sincerely,
