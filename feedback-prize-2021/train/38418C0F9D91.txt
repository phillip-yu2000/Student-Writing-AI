Everyone has had a time in their life when they needed help. Some people ask for advice to help them with there problem. When seeking advice many people talk to more than one person. Asking more than one person for advice helps people make a good decision by, one giving them a wide variety of options they can choose from, and two by finding people who are more qualified to give advice on your topic than others.

Getting more opinions to choose from lets people find the option they think is right instead of having one option that they have to choose. For an example Generic_Name got a offered his dream job, but Generic_Name already has a job working at Microsoft for a much higher pay. He asks his boss and friends for advice, his boss says he should stay here at Microsoft while his friends say he should go to his dream job. Generic_Name looks at all the advice he got and made a decision to work at his dream job.

By asking many people for advice you might find someone who had a similar experience to your problem. For an example when Generic_Name asked his friends for advice he found out that Generic_Name experienced the same problem in the past. Generic_Name asked what Generic_Name did in that situation and Generic_Name replied with "Go to your dream job, I stayed at my job, and I wish would've taken the my dream job." So Generic_Name made the right decision, and left his job to work at his dream job.

Asking lots of people for advice helps people make a good decision by, one giving them an a assortment of options they can choose from, and two by finding people who have experienced a similar problem in the past. Asking multiple people for advice lets the person pick a choice they agree with or like instead of having only one option you have to choose. If you ask enough people you might find someone who experienced a similar problem making them more qualified than other people. Thats why people ask more than one person for advice.
