I do not think that driverless cars are a good idea, i believe this because there could be a lot of hazard and danger behind this action. First how would these computers like programs know when to go or turn at a stop light? This could create many dangers and conflicts on the road. Next how could these computers detect humans? If the car doesn't know a person is j walking it could run over the person and possibly kill them, and yes j walking is illegal but it still happens. Finally i don't think these computers are a good idea because of malfunction. If something goes wrong in the car or the brakes go out it can lead to death for the passenger. I just think these vehicles are a little way to risky and not safe. In the article it says these cars need to be proven more safe. So this means these cars are not safe at the moment. As you can see i believe these cars are not safe and i am against it.
