The Seagoing Cowdays program is a good program if you like spending weeks at a time on a boat. It has great views of the ocean, and if you get up early you might be able to see the sun rising up over the ocean. You will be able to go to most likely new countries all over if you like that stuff, and see new things there also. You can meet new people, see new things, and be aware of their needs. It might be a little risky being on that boat in a storm. When the animals are gone and your on your way to get more there is room and time to do things like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and much more. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a huge opportunity and a great adventure. If you do choose to join, then great. I hope you enjoy you adventure and have fun.
