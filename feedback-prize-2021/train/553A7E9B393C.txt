Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example sports,work on the school year book,or serve for student council do i agree or disagree with this argument.

First off I would like to start off by saying, the principal might just want his students to have more than education. The principal just wants to have a little more fun in school instead of just sitting in side day doing boring classwork. So i should ask this, have you ever been in school and you are bored out of your mind? Well that is exactly why this principal is doing this for his students in his school.

Secondly just let me back "up"! When your bored at your house what do you do? Well most of you would say um i play Fortnite or I play my Xbox or GTA 5 something like that. But when your at school your like please just get me out of here its so boring! So now is when im going to say that is why this school principals doing this for his student's because he dose not want his students to get bored.

Thirdly when a student gets bored they will do anything possible to not be bored. So thats what leads in to timeout slips and then it starts disrupting the class and it also stops the students from learning. So this is another reason why this principle doing this for his students. hen it gets so bad that it stops the others from learning you know its time to do something bout that. Like even some teachers have board games in their classrooms.

Fourthly that is why their are after school sports such as football,resulting,basketball,baseball,soccer,and even volleyball. But now im at the point where im deciding whether or not im agreeing or disagreeing on the argument. So im going to agree with this argument. But just remember when your bored in class try not to stop the others from learning.
