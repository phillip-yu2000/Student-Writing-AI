Dear Principal,

I do not think that you should make it mandatory for students to perform community service.

Community service is great and all but some people just do not have the time to do it.

Some people need the time they spend on community service to do important things like homework or sports.

Some people need time for themselves every once in a while. I do not think you should have kids do community service.

I know from personal experience that community service takes to much time.

I have a baseball practice every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

I also have basketball practice every Tuesday and Thursday.

On the weekends I have games for both sports.

Not only that my brother has the same schedule so when and who could take me to community service.

I think it is bad idea.

Say that you barely have time for community service.

When would you have time for yourself.

I like to enjoy the little free time that I get.

Right now with all my sports and school I barely get a hour to myself each day.

If you add community service instead of that hour then I will have no free time.

Everyone needs a little free time for themselves.

I am strongly against community service.

Community service is good but it just takes to much time.

I know that not everyone at our school can do community service.

Most of my friends do sports like me and do not have the time.

I do not think you should make it mandatory for students at this school to perform community service.

From,
