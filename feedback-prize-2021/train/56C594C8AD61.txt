In my perspective,

I think the new policy for not letting kids be sports is very unfair to all the other students in the school. Some kids really like to be in sports and other things and they just can't help the fact that they don't know a subject very well. What if they only have one C? Are you really going to hold that against them? All because of one little C? I mean, a C isn't that bad. Kids make mistakes. Some kids are strong in some subject, and some just cant quiet get there. Not everyone is good at one thing. And if they are struggling with a subject of two,

you should at least understand there predicament. A C average isn't that bad at all. Now if they were making D's and F's, then there's a problem. But a C? There's no harm against it. Besides, If half the school is making a C average, then who is going to be on that specific sports or team?

What if all the people that are making an A or B average, are not interested in sports or other activity?

What's the point of even having a sport at the school if no one is making a higher grade than a C? I know you want kids to succeed in life, but not everyone is perfect. Plus, being in an activity or sport can really help sharpen the brain. Remind kids once in a while to bring up there grade, but don't make a policy. It just isn't fair for everyone. My point here is that I think kids that have a grade that is higher than a C, can be able to play in sports and be in an activity.
