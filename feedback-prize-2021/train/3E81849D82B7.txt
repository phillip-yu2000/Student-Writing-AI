Dear Principal,

Some of the students here believe that we, the school, should be able to use our cell phones in our free time. But, other students oppose, they feel they do not need to use their cell phones at all. I for one hold the belief that cell phones should only be used during break, lunch, after school, etc. People should be able to use the phones during these time and these times alone.

For example if someone had taken a fall and broken their arm, leg, etc. and nobody was around to help them, if the schools policy was that they must not have their phone during school then they would have no contact to anyone that may be able to help them. The phones are sometimes a must have. Since the phones are to be off during class time the people who feel the need of having no interruption whatsoever may have their quiet, and everyone is happy. the people who want their quiet and the people who feel the need to socialize.

Now, the teachers will also be happy too. the Students have already socialized enough at break, so they should probably be more silent. The teachers can finally teach in peace the end result is a win for everyone. No one feels their expectation for quiet or socialization unmet.

Your student,
