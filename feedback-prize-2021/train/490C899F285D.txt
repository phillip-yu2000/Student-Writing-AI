to principal students have now been informed that you are considering changing a policy that will not allow students with a grade below a B to participate in a sport.

this kind of policy will not be a good change to the school mainly because most of our students have a C average but that is not failing.

students should not be allowed to participate in a sport or activity only if they are failing one or more classes.

also that will allow more students to participate in a sport/activity. this will also benefit the school.

Another reason not to change the policy the students need the exorcise to stay on task-forces during the school day.

by changing this policy that will have less students participating in a sport/activity so less students will be fit and on task during the school day. kids on and average day need a lest and hour of movement having sports/activty more available to the students can really benefit the students health. also discipline students need something to do after school in the winter allowing there be more flexibility in the grade average. more students will be getting into less trouble with police and there parents. because they'll have something to do.

sports/activitys also allow students to talk to each other and make friends. socializing is needed to get to know people and also make friends. socializing is also a part of being healthy you need to interact with other people and get ready for the real world. so by working on your people skills know is important sports/activtys can benefit that.
