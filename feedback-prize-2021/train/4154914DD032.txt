I think we should change elections to popular vote because it will give the people more say in the elections, it will be more fair, and you would actually be voting for the president and vice president them selves, and not for a slate of electors.

First of all, if we change elections to be based off of popular vote people will have more say in the elections as to who gets elected. Forr example, when you cast a vote for the president you want to be elected you arent voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors who will vote for the president. But if we change it to popular vote you will actually be voting for the president andÂ  vice president them selves instead of voting for a slate.

Secondly, if we change voting to popular votes it will be more fair. it will be more fair because votes wont be controlled by the electoral college so it will be more fair. thats why we should change voting to popular voting for elections.
