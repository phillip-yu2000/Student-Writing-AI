In the artical "Making Mona Lisa Smile" it talks about how a new form of technology that can read human emotions was used to read the emotions of the Mona Lisa could be used to read other human emotions. Dr. Huang, from Beckman institute worked on the computer with other scientis. the computer was programed to read the expresions of humans by first making a 3D model of the face, along with all 44 major muscels in the face too.

How this would be valuable in the classroom. well it argues in ther artical how if this technology was available in all classrooms that this would ba able to help students learn in their own way or how the computer would be able to recognize the emotions that the student is expressing and would be able to change or modify the lesson for the sudent. if this sort of technology was available it would change the whole outlook on how we learn and change the whole outlook on the classroom. it would give students a better chance of learning and help how they learn,it would make each lesson personal to each student.

If this form of technology was made available then they major impact that it would have on schools and on students would be so grand that it would cahnge the face of learning. so therefor i do belive that the use of this technology is valuable in a classroom.
