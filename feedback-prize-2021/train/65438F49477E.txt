Studying Venus is worthy pursuit despiting the danger, becuase many astronomoers are interested Venus. Astronomers think Venus might be the most, "Earth like planet in our solar system."

In the article they say that NASA is figuring out ways they can send people to Venus without being on its surface. NASA is also trying multiple ways to make their equipment more resistence to the heat in Venus.

Atronomers think that venus might compare to Earth. In the article is says, "Long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. just like Earth." Venus also has some features that look alike to Earth. in the article it also says that there were, "valleys, mountains, and craters" just like Earth.

Another way to study Venus is that NASA is creating ways to go to Venus, but not to be on its surface. NASA is wanting to have Aircraft to hover above Venus. They would use solat power for energy, but radiation would exceed earth's levels. In the article it say, " Not easy conditions but survivable for humans."

The last way to study Venus is that NASA is tesing and making material that can handle Venus's tempature. In the article it says, " Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three week in such conditions." Another ways is to use old technology which is called mechanical computers.

In conclusion studying Venus would be a benefit for us. If atronomers are right that Venus is a look alike to Earth. We can get materials that we need or learn how to use new material that we find there. With the help of NASA making new materials and ways to get there. Atronomers can get there in no time.
