The second policy is the best policy for the school because it keeps students from cheating, it prevents texting and other activities related to phones from happening in the classroom, and promotes the better usage of time with class and studying at school.

Children could use phones to ask each other the answers to a question.

They could give each other advise on tests and what to look out for on a certain question.

thus making it easier for them to cheat.

Children also text during class to pass the time when they are not interested in the subject.

Talking about other things in class not relevant to the class.

this takes their attention away from class causing them to miss the information learned in the class.

Allowing the usage of phones would take the students attention of their studies and waist their time for the perpetration of future test. no phones at school will allow better usage of time and energy towards school.

using the second policy will make the student life easier in the future
