Can multiple opinions make a difference does it matters if more than one person is involved. It matters because you get more information,you can see another persons opinion and they might be effected by it.

First they might have more information. They could have facts on the situation. They might have seen someone do something. They could tell you what is wrong with something. They might tell you the damage.

Second you could see another persons opinion. They might be able to tell you if a cirtan group of people will hate it or like it. They might be able to tell you if there is something wrong. They could tell you to get information. They could tell you to get the word out.

Third they could be effected by it. They could tell you what is wrong. they might want a apology and threaten to never use it again. They could want a refund. They could want a new one.

Finally you know why people should get advice and what might happen if you dont. And why it matters because you get more information,you can see another persons opinion and they might be effected by it. Now if you havent already go out their and use my advice.
