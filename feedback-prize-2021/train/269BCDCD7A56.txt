All students should be able to participate in sports or other activities even with a grade C average, with the average of a C is passing the student should be able to participate. If the student does not keep his or her grade at a C average or higher then they will not be able to participate in the school activities or sports. The principal should not change the policy because it is not fair to other students who are not at the average grade level that is being required. All students should be able to be involved in the schools Sports, Activities, Or other school programs. Some students can not maintain a B or C average but the student is very well sports, but can not participate because of their grades. So with that the principal of out school should not change the school policy.

With the possible chance of the student failing the principal should then change the policy, but not if the student has a C average , the policy should be changed if and when the student drops his or he grade level down to a D or even a possible F average, then the student will have to take tutoring and will not be able to participate in any of the school activities or sports.
