The main reason car usage should be limited is the pollution it causes. The emission given off from the cars cause massive amounts of polution.

Smog causes layes of emission to be trappen in Earths atmosphere and cause problems with breathing when unhealthy air is breathed in. The emission released from a car causes a huge affect on the atmosphere. We have to be limited on our usage or a few years from now our will not be able to be taken in at all without being sick!

There are many ways to reduce the usage of cars. We can ride bikes,carpool,or take public transportation. With us using less cars we will be able to slow down the rate at which car emissions are being released into the air.

Everyone needs to begin to stop and think if cars are really nessasary in their lives. Can you carpool with a friend? Does the public transportation run in your area and on your route to work or school? We are getting to the point where we have to limit driving all together so that we can still have healthy air to live. Would it be worth it when you are dead? I dont think so.

Now cars are begining to be eletric so that they dont let out as much emission from the car. With the eletric cars we are able to go to work and know we using half as much gas and the emission being let off is not nearly as much if we were to be driving a normal gas powered car. Eletric cars allow us to know that not as much damage is being done to our enviorment.

So get out there and start walking, riding a bike with a friend, or carpool ! Don't let cars be the death of us! We can save the Earth starting with taking well trips in the car and start taking the two foot express!
