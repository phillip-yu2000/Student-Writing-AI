what would you say if you principal said all student must participate in a least one extracurricular activity?

will you yes or what will think about that will you disagree or agree.

in opinion i will say no because the school might not have the right space to many people because some people like to play a lot of sports they want to be after school everyday so will we have the amount of space to hold to many student i think not because the students have to wait in the cafe we it's really small for then they can go to there activity will the the school fit the student in there activity what will happen if there no space to do this activity the always number one thing to remember is that we have to be careful with the student is sure so we want to have deceitful we the seem the space is big but is not if we tell the student the people that are staying after come to the cafe and there is a lot of people it's to get crowed in there there is going to be a lot of people and there is not gong to enough seat so every can seat there so if the principal come solution it will be great but i will still think it is not a good idea to have extracurricular activity this is my second reason why we should not have extracurricular for the student my second reason is that will student and teacher have the time to stay after school for there activity?

i think no because there 75% percent of the students in the school don't stay after school because they think they better stuff to do some they don't want to be in school no more so why make student participate in a least one exrecular activity and what if the the activity get full some the student will be like man i wish i was in the activity but is to full sometimes student don't get what they want that why they don;t stay after school because they think if soccer is full so i don't after they say if there is no in soccer available they don't stay after they want what they want. they don't want to force to take activity they want to be free and do what they like and about teacher some teacher will not have the time to help with the activity some are married and have kid they to care about there family or they have to somewhere else the teacher that are not marry they have other reponsibity out of school they have buy stuff of many have go do something that will benefit there student like get them some book to read or other stuff,but some of the teacher will say that i don't have the time but if pay me a little more i will stay so if they school does't want to go broke because of pay the teacher more to stay after school i think we should not recomed student to stay after school to do a extracurricular activity this is my second reason why we should not have to force student to taker extracurricular activity.

will the people that don't like to play sport will agree or disagree with the principal idea?

remember we need to think about other that don't like to play sport they like to play games,read book,or draw they like to do other stuff. they will not like to stay they will i want to lay games is want to be in a quiet place they want to be free from loud noises they dont want anything to disturb them they want to do something but quiet the disagree withe principal they will say i wanted to something quietly but these was so loud they like to do their stuff in a quiet place bu some,some hate spots but the are good a doing other stuff they like to do what they feel what is right for them self some student they arent do like them playing sport they tel they kid focus in education instead of playing sport they say that are spt are not going to feed they say if a good education that is going to do you we you are older some parents say if you become a soccer what are going to do we you retired what you going to do are going to be a dishwasher or what but if you get a good education when you're old you are going to have a job a good one that what parent tell kid do stay after school spots are not going to help this my third reason why i should think we should not extracurricular activity,

now that i explain my reason why we should not have extracurricular activity, do you still argree or degree ?
