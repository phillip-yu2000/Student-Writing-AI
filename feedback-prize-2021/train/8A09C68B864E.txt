Im going to except the offer because Luke wants to take care of the horses,cows, and mules that are going over seas but if you like animals you should sign up or if you like takeing care of animals then get down here and sign up. I know because in the story it said the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hird "Seagoing Cowboys"to take care of the horses,young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up. And if you have not been on the ocean and would like to well sign up. Or if you have not been to arround the world you would like to be a seagoing cowboy I know this because in the artical it said " They got their seaman's paper and boarded ths SS Charles W. Wootster for greece- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. So if you like all these things sign up I know I would because I think it would be an awesome experance to get to see and know I think you would have fun too.
