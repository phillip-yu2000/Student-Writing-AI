Asking others for advice can be a good strategy for getting a solid idea on almost anything. Asking multiple people could be a good idea even if you trust yourself. Different people have different ideas on different topics. Some people might be very clean people other people could not be so clean. They are all different.

Say one day you are asking people how they like your brand new special edition cherry red car. You would think that most people would say its amazing, but there might be others who know a lot about cars and say it doesnt look that fast, or thats the least rare model. People can say and have different opinions on topics

One day you decide "hey I should buy myself a new pair of sneakers, I just earned a lot of money from my job let me treat myself" you dont know what type of shoes to buy because you are new to shoe culture and what everyone is wearing or wants. You go ask your friend for some advice who is a big sneaker head "hey I want to get a really nice pair of shoes what shoes should I get" he says, " I dont know, what type of shoes do you like" I say, "I like basketball and I am into skateboarding" he say "I recommend the Jordan 1's there the most iconic and legendary shoe of both worlds or the Nike Dunks which are the Jordan 1's built more for skateboarding" I look up the shoes, " theses are crazy I am totally going to buy these, aye thanks for the advice man." Your friends probably might know a little more about different topics then you do, so go ask them.
