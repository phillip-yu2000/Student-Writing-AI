Dearest Principal,

Many students throughout our country now play sports.

They are free to participate in any kind of sports they prefer. Some of the schools don't agree with the fact the students need a B average. That is why so many of the students in this school don't agree that we should really need a B average to play sports.

It's been going around the school that our grades are not perfect enough to participate in activity. Some students in the school may not have a B average, but that does not mean they shouldn't play sports. The reasons could be that they speak another language, like Spanish or French an may not fully understand us so well. It can also be to the fact that some kids come from different type of background family such as religion and can not study what we are leaning. Even kids that are a bit slow in learning or mentally can have a few problems with studying their objects.

Other reasons could possibly be the fact that the teachers don't quietly go slow enough to make sure that the students do not fall behind. Another reason for students to not have a B average in their score could be because of their leaning disabilities, like autism or dyslexia. I personally play sports like soccer an softball, even outside of school, and I enjoy them and It's a way to spend more time with friends. And if I study hard enough, i might be able to go to college in the future an get a good career. It's not because some students don't want to do the work, It's the problems that go around their
