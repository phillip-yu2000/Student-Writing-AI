Have you ever been in a problem and you're not exactly sure what to do? Well a lot of people have. Lets say you're confused on what to do when doing something, some people may try to figure out what to do by their self, some may also seek advice from others. When asking for an opinion, you're asking other people what they think. After you have gotten your advice, your set! You got an opinion that could possibly help you out. But one isn't always enough, there are loads of people that have different opinions too, one is good, but more is better.

One opinion is a door that has opportunity, but when you ask more people for opinions, it opens more doors with more opportunity. Asking for more than one opinion can be good becuase it can help you with the task at hands. With more than one opinion you can think about how they are helpful and if they are worth paying attention to. Now that you have multiple opinions, you think of which one will help you the most, you will have a bigger idea on things involving the situation. When listening to an opinion, there are details that help support their idea, and sometimes these details are worth paying attention to. What people add along with their opinion can make the room expand giving you more things to explore.

In conclusion, when having trouble with something, asking for someones advice can open up an opportunity. But when you ask for more advice from more people, there are more opportunities to explore and think about. Asking for more opinions will give you a bigger understanding on how or what to do. Opinions are helpful in about every way possible, because they add details that help you with the task at hand. The details of one can lead to the details of many, more the people, more the understanding, but hey what do i know, thats just my opinion.
