Dear principal,

I am writing this letter to tell you my opinion on the changing of the grades you must have to play sports. I believe that kids with a C average should be aloud to play sports because that is the average grade. Many kids do not do as well in school as others, but that is no reason to punish them by taking away there sports activity's. If we made this change many people would be taken out of sports and therefore possibly lose a college scholarship.

Another reason you should not change the grade policy for sports is that, children need sports in there life sometimes. They can be a helping aid to help them cope with many things they have going on in life. Also kids meet many of there long term friends in sports and just because they don't do as well in school does not mean you should take their sports away which could possibly hurt them socially. Which I learned in Health class recently that if you are hurt socially you would not be healthy because social health is a big part of everyone's life.

Lastly, many kids not have such a wonderful life which could be a reason for such low grades. They could be trying to pull them up or hopefully are but that does not mean you should take away sports for a C average. Sports also could be there way to be happy in life because of a bad home life. They escape from all of that at school. I believe you should just keep the grades you must have to play sports at 2F's and you are not able to play. Maybe a D average but please do not change it to a C average and you are done.

So please principal do not take away something that could end up hurting us. We all try our best in school and so if we have a C average then maybe that's out best. Just please do not take away some people's sports because they have a lower level of learning.
