Driverless cars, that seem cool. But there are still a downside to it. I think there useless because, we are already lazy, they still can't take full control.

I think there useless becasue we are already lazy, like we aready have cars that take us places but there will be cars that that we just get on and he car does everything. Like yeah the cars takes us places but at least we have something to do. the driverless cars we just get on and we don't do anything like we can be on our phones and like we can probobly have like a full meal.

I think the car is useless because, well they call it the driverless car but there still has to be someone in the driver sit. LIke driverless car means theres no one driveing it. They say the car will need help like when there is a road block or when the roads are bad.

Thats why i think the driverless cars are useless because, we are already lazy, they don't have control over the car or they still need a diver to drive it.
