Many people think the face on mars was created by a alien becuase it was all over Hollywood, in grocery stores, books and magaziens, and on the radio. But it really wasnt creater by aliens.

It was in Hollywood films, in grocery stores, on the radio,also in books and magiziens. You cant believe every thing you watch in movies or online. Two thirds of Hollywoods movies are based on things they know that people wpuld watch. People can put anything in a newspaper or say it on the radio and people would think it was the truth. But you will need research and evidence to make sure what you watch or hear is true. You can also go to the gricey store and hang up any type of posters and make someone believe that what that poster say is the truth.

The face on mars was really a natuarl rock that was shaped like a face. it was discovered on April 5, 1998 when they took better photos. But a few scentists were convinced that it was an alien artifact. Its just like how we have natural landfroms, Mars have a natrual face on it. Its located 41 degrees north martian latitude.
