Dear TEACHER_NAME,

From my point of view, i believe policy one is better.

There are multiple reasons why i agree with policy one.

The first reason is because i am a teenager and teenagers always want to have there phones with them.

Another reason is if i didn't feel good, i would like my parents to know.

Lastly, if we get to have phones at lunch and other free times, then there wont be as many phones out and on during class.

There are some negatives for having phones out to though.

One negative is that there is a higher chance that you could get your phone stolen.

Also, your teachers could see you sending bad stuff to other people in your class at that time.

Some students wouldn't turn there cell phones off in class, so therefore more cell phones would be taken away.

Although there are negative and positives, i still would have to go with policy one.

During lunch i think everyone would have a much better time with there phones out because it gives them a chance to be more social.

They could get more social because they would talk to there friends at there lunch table and text someone in there lunch that doesn't sit with them.

Also, students would be able to have there phones out in slt, so they could text any of there friends during that time.

Some students are known for goofing off and not listening.

If a student does goof off or gets in trouble, i think just that student should get his phone privileges taken away.

The whole school shouldn't suffer from not having there phones because one person messed up.

I think the student who goofs off or gets in trouble should just have his phone taken away.

I would extremely like it if we got to have our cell phones out in free time.

All these reasons show why i support this policy.

I would very much appreciate it if we got to have our phones out in free time.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
