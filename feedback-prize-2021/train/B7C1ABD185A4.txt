I don't think that is fair that you have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities. It doesn't seem like that would be fair.

I don't think that would be fair because some kids are good in sports and they are not that good in school. Like they don't pay attention in school. Like for example i am good at sports but i cant do them because of my grades i got D' s. They should let you participate with at least D average. It only seems fair. When you cant do a sport because of your grades your letting your teammates down because you have to have a B average. Its hard to get a B because sometimes you don't get what the teacher is saying and to shy to ask question's so that brings your grades down. If are school we had to at least to get a B to de on sports or any other activities not that many people would be on the team. Most of the people that are on the sports teem or other activities most of them got C' s and D 'S
