Would you ever want to have a job that you could explore the ocean and visit many different countrys and see unique things. It would be nice to have a job like that

In the passage ''A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves''this boy named Luke bomberger, who just graduated high school had two jobs and he got offered by his friend Don Reist to join this exiting event. Luke could not say no.

In the passage Luke said that he enjoyed the job A lot. There was many things he got to do like go over seas,he rescued animals,and more. It states in paragraph 3 that he traveled with 335 horses on August,14,1945. In my opinion that is a lot of horses on one boat.

He got to travel many places like Europe,China,Greece and more. He said that it takes about two weeks to get to cross the Atlantic ocean and a month to get to China. left time to play baseball,vollyball,tabletennis,fencing,boxing reading,and more. it says in the intro in the passage that he traveled 16 times over the Atlantic Ocean and twice over the Pacific Ocean.

As you can see it would be A lot of fun to be A seagoing cowboy. You would get to adventure things just like Luke did. In my opinion that would be A lot of fun to travel over seas and save people and animals. Not only that you will also be able to explore many things like China and Europe. and you might even see very historic things. I hope you think about this job. It could be an opportunity of a lifetime.
