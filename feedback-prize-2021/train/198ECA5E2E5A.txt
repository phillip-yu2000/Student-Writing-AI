Dear Principal,

I agree with your decision that you have to have a B average in school to participate in sports and other activities. There are a couple of reasons why this would help the school and the students become a better community.

For one it would set a higher standard for students, which would make them try harder in school. Athletes that would want to play sports would then put academics first and athletics second, which is important.

This would also make it so that the athletes would be determined to strive in both school and sports, which makes for better people. Plus people that want to play sports but don't have a B average, would realize that you have to try hard at something to earn something rewarding. Students are led to believe that a C or even a D is okay, but it will not get you far in life, so this project will help kids realize how much more they can achieve and accomplish with better grades.

Another reason is that this would boost the overall GPA for the school and get the school more recognition. A lot of middle school students want to play a sport (or sports), at a young age and are also encouraged to be active by their parents and their community. So if a lot of students want to play sports and be on a team they also want to have good grades to be able to play on the team. If the school had a better overall GPA it would get more recognition and awards from the community and the students would get more rewards for their academics and their athletics.

So therefore I agree with your choice and I think it will help the staff, the students, and the community to become a better place.

From,

A student
