Which side are you on? The schools principal wants every student in the school to take an extracurricular activity at school something like sports, yearbook club, or join the student council would you agree with this? Or would you disagree with this? I would disagree with the principal this time.

Some students have a lot of other things to do after school so a lot of time they don't have the time to stay after school and do that. I think students should be able to pick what they want to do for school and not be forces to do it. plus some students don't find those things fun to do and maybe they already have sports after school to do or and club they already signed up for out of school. I don't think that the principle should be able to chose what student should do for fun. or maybe some students want to go home and relax from a hard day at school.

Also students already have a lot of stress and doing something extra could cause more stress for students. If students are force to do something they might not find it as fun as they thought it would. If it was during school the students might want to do other things for their class but they can't because the principal is forcing them to do something. If someone wanted to take a language they can't because you have to take a sport or club. students don't like thing that are taken away from them they tend to get mad.

So I would have to disagree with this because I don't think the principal should get to pick what students want to do in their free time. Just let the students pick what they want to do so they can have fun at school and not stress over a lot of things. Also so students should get the freedom of choice so they don't get over whelmed. That's why I would disagree and I hope you will do the same thank you for your time.
