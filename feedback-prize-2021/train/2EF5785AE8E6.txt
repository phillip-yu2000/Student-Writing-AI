Driverless Cars in my opinion is a little off the charts due to the fact many things can happen. The author states that

" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufactureer?" And the Author states that;

"Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times." Driverless cars is a bad idea.

Driverless cars are off the chart because some states such as : California, Nevada, Florida , and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars. Now thats nowhere near half the country. If driverlsess cars do go on there will need to be more laws and regulations. Driverless cars are off the chart for many ways and reasons.

The author states that " If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? I personally think it would be the manufactuers fault for 1, making the product. 2, not knowing all things that can go wrong in accidents. And 3, not being able to help the driver out in sisutations like accidents,or traffic jams. Manufacturers would be in charge do to the fact they made the car and they should know everything that goes with the car both good and bad.

Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This statement I feel is so True because if a human isnt in charge of the car then there are many chances bad stuff will happen. But in reality theres a human behind all the computer work and GPS's . But as a person not driving yet I feel if a car is controlled by computers it can cause and led to many accidents and injuries. So Driverless cars is a bad idea and will aqumilate many accidents and injuries.
