When you need advice do you just talk to one person or more? Its way better telling people the things that happen so you can get there view because you might not see it the way they do. When you tell more people you get more advice and thats good. Let's say that you have some things going on in your life and you want some advice to try to make it a bit better so you ask a couple of your friends to help you and give you some advice. They give you advice and you take it and try it and it works so it made you feel it better but thats only one advice they gave from all your friends so there is still a bit more. So you day got better. An yes i understand sometimes you don't want to share your stuff with people so you just have one friend you tell everything to and they help with everything they listen,give back what they think. An yea you might have a different thought of if this like you might think just telling one perosn is better because you don't feel like sharing your stuff with people and i get that but when you need advice do you just want that person or alot of people giving you advice. It's your choice on what pick.

But i still asking people for some advice is better because like i said earlier they give more advice, They will give there option and tell if if your in the right or wrong. An they will always be there for you no matter what, thats why i say yes. because you never know what they will tell you or do about the things you tell them but if there real friends they'll stick by yotu side no matter what.
