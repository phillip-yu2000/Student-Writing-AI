Dear Principal,

You shouldn't cancel sports unless students have a grade B average. Student need physical activity after sitting down and writing for eight hours or more. Every student needs freedom for exercising or moving because trust these chairs are uncomfortable and it hurts our backs having to sit in them for more than 2 hours. So many students have so much energy that can't be contained in the class room.

Cancelling sports for students under a grade B average isn't very intelligent move because some try their hardest to get great grades. Students try and try but they just do as well as others putting in the same amount of effort, but getting higher grades. Instead of cancelling sport students under B average create a tutoring program and sign them up and this can help them get the grades they deserve.

As a principal you can create a program that will help students stay on the path and guarantee their success in school work and not just have them mess up because of issues that distract them. During lunch, free time, or something along those teachers can offer help for students who are willing to take it. Or the teachers and principal can create classes that need help in similar subjects and find times of a week to help the different, but don't give the class a name because some students would fell as if they are in special education or something along those lines. Just please don't cancel sports that is something they need in their lives.
