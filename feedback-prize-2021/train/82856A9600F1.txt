A world without cars. Around the world many places have decreased in the use of motorized vehicles. Wether it be government inforced or not vehicle useage has dropped a staggering amount in the past few years. This new habbit has had many effect on the environment, car industries, and even the way cities are built. What will become of the future if this trend continues?

It says in "The End of Car Culture", "...transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. Therfore if the use of cars decre4ases as it has then carbon emmisions will also decrease along with it and will in turn cause the greenhouse effect to ripidly slow. Evn though we would all love the world to be "greenhouse free" it is still quite far away, one thing thats this decrease in vehicles is effecting is Motor Companies.

The decrease in sales has caused major car companies such as Ford and Mercedes to, "rebrand themselves mobility companies with broader product raange beyond the personal vehicle. One example of this happinging is shown in soure 4: "Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Companu, laid out a bussiness worl plann in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable." As you can tell this recently discovered trend has caused major companies to resolve into making almost entirely new products.

The worl is slowly but surely loosing the desire for personal vehicles and it has many positive effects but it also has plenty of counter, negative, effects. They always has said "no good deed goes unpunished", all we can do is sit back and see what happens.    Â
