I disagree with you that it "The Face Of Mars" was formed by aliens. I think it is a landformation that just happens to look like a face. From 1976 to 2001 we have found zero life on Mars. We have made many missions to it and we still have found nothing. Besides those reasons i still disagree with you about it and i do have proof of my reasons why.

The article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" tells me that scientist Jim Garvin was one of the men that took the picture of the "face" inApril 8, 2001. After Jim takes the picture and tells everyone, "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" Jims says this because, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

Also there are unusual shadows to make it look like the landform has eyes and a nose. The shadows also made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But you have to remember that these are shadows and they dont tell always make out to what things look like. Sometimes your shadow makes you look taller than what you really seem to be. Shadows also dont always make you look the same either.

Plus Martian Mesa, are common enough around Cydonia. This could be just another Martian Mesa. Also if NASA wishes there was an ancient civilataion on Mars, why would they hide it. If they even thought that the "face" could have been formed by aliens im sure that they would want the world to know of there discovery.

In other words im sure NASA would let people know if they even think that the "face" could have been formed from aliens. This is like a mountain on Earth that just at a height and where the camera is at or the sun iot just so happens to look like a face. This is an unusual landform but i am very convinced that, that is all it is.
