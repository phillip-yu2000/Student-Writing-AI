Dear Principal,

I have wrote you this letter to inform you of what I think we should do for our community service.

I think that you should give us some time of community service but don't make it so high that it will take up all of our time.

I have friends that like the community service and won't mine a lot of time. I also know that there are a lot of kids that will mind. If you want to please them I say you don't make the community service that long. I say at first you make every student do like two hours and then after that you have volunteers. I know some people will want to do like five to six hours of community service. This will also give a chance to the kids to make more friends and bond more. Sure I know there will be kids that will be bickering just for two hours but if you get every student to do that it will be fair.

Suggestions from me would be to make the service fun like playing with little kids like helping in classrooms. Or possibly helping the elderly. Doing things like these will make the kids want to do more because it will be heart warming to them and also like i said earlier it will be a good chance for bonding.
