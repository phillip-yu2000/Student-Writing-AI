Dear Principal;

I agree with your thoughts of changing the average grade of a C, being able to participate in sports or other activities, to a B. These kids show much slacking off, they need to learn in their classes and remember the things they learn as well. Some students are getting away with a F in a class. That is to reasonable for their part. I think if they really want to play a sport they will work and try to get good grades and if they don't work they should not be rewarded for that. I know kids who when they get home they watch television and wait for their sport/activity to start. Kids these days don't work hard enough. School is easy for them and being able to be in a sport is easy enough as well. When I see kids with an average grade of a C going home and watching television it makes me wonder if the school is doing a good job or not.

I would very much appreciate if you took this realistically because students do not deserve to play sports with a C. If I see a student doing everything they can to earn a better grade to do these things but just can't seem to get it and have it make much sense I would talk to someone like you and ask personally to give them some slack but if these other kids barely work to get a C to be allowed these privileges, that is just unfair! I think the grade average should be at least a B so there is no room for a lousy F at all!

I would very much appreciate if you took action in doing so. Thank you very much for taking your time to read this.

Sincerely,

an innocent bystander
