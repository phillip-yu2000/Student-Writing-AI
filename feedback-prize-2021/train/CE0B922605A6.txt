The Facial Action Coding System is a good idea if the general populous likes it. There is a posiblity that most everyone would like to have that coding system on their computer to make life that extra step easier. Profs. like Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe have disinged it to help keep students active in school, and to help people keep their research interesting or just make someone happy when they are angry or bored by ajusting what they are looking at on the screen.

I feel like the Facial Action Coding System will or would help students to stay awake and more aware that their computer can read their emoutions and change to how they are feeling like with ads and if you smile when you see one then more would come up like that. When you look at a website and perhaps you smile a lot on this website then the computer could adapt to wedsites that you like. If you do not like something on your computer like an ad then less of those ads would appear.

There will be people against the idea because they would feel vulnerable with a computer actually reading their emotions. It would be more practicle for you in different ways such as ajusting a lesson in school when you are starting to get bored or drousy. The computers would have a dumbed down version of the algorithm because most home desktops would not be able to work with such a complecated system but instead would be able to use the algorithm in detecting small things like a smile or a frown to tell if you liked what was on your computer monitor or not.

This would be a nice system to use but a lot of people not like the idea and they have their reasons. But here was a few to perhaps change a mind into liking the idea or just simply accepting it. Everyone has their own emotions and feelings about what they see or read about and this new system could detect those feelings, and help out to support or to completely change what was just seen by that person using a computer..
