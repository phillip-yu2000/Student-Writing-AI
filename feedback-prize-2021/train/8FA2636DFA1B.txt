"It is definitely an alien-made structure!" And with that, I must disagree. My coworker at NASA believes deeply that the face on mars, a formation on the Red Planet in an area named Cydonia, is made by aliens. I, on the other hand, do not agree. of course they asked me for my argument, and I will give one as requested.

The Viking 1 spacecraft caught a very blury image of the formation. It did resemble a human face, and with a second picture taken in 1998, it still represented just that. The 1998 picture was clearer, but was still missing the detail needed to point out anything proving the alien relations. Not everyone was satisfied with that image either, so there was another search, and an image taken at very high quality in 2001 shows absolutely not relation of alien creation having to do with the formation. It is shown just to be another mesa, simply like the coincidental structures we have here on earth.

My argument is simply that with what material we have, all things point to another mesa, not an alien creation. The final photo in '01 has high quality, and without showing evidence of alien relations, there is no way that I am to believe it was formed by aliens.
