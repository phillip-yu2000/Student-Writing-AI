I think that policy 1 would be a good choice. I think that there's nothing wrong with people using there cell phones at school. I think that there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to use you phone during lunch or at your own free time cause its your own time and you should be able to do what you like. I think that you should also be able to use cell phones in class at the right times also cause sometimes they can be helpful by using the calculator or internet on them to help you with your work in class. I know that some people wont use there phones the way you tell them to like them texting people with them but if you don't let people use there phones they most likely still are going to use them. Most people are mad cause they cant use there phones so they use them during times when they should be doing class work or listening to the teacher. So I think that you should at least use or phones at lunch or on our free time so we wont be bored and so we can listen to music. I hope you pick policy 1 so that we can use our cell phones at lunch and at free time.
