TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should choose the first policy because students wouldn't really like the second. If you banned cell phones from school most students would bring them anyways. There would also be the issue with texting in class. And last but not least some parents need their children to have their cell phones with them when they are not at the house.

The reason that students would bring their cell phones to school if you banned them, would be just the simple fact that they are banned. Teenagers have an irrational desire to disobey rules. Banning cell phones would only encourage their defiance and give them that much more reason to bring their cell phones to school.

So not only would there be cell phones at school but students would text in class. This would be like adding insult to the injury. Now if we were allowed to use our cell phones in free time there would be no need to text in class. Meaning we would pay more attention to the teacher than to our phones.

Last some students have responsibilities that require that they have their phone with them. For example my bus drops me off in front of my little sister's elementary school. Everyday I call my mom to tell her I got my sister and that we're on our way home. I'm sure I'm not the only student that does this. So if i left my phone at home there would be the problem of my parents worrying weather or not i picked up my little sister and if we where already walking home.

So I ask that you consider my reasons of why you should chose the first policy and let us use our cell phones at school. Instead of banning them like the second policy would have you do.
