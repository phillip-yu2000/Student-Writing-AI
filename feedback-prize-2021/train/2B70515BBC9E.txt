Astronauts risk their life by exploring the different planets in our solar system. In the article ''The Challenge of Exploring Venus'' talks about how dangerous it could be to exoplor it. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because it was once the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, and NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.

Venus may be inhospitable now, but it was once the most Earth-like planets in our solar system. In the article it discusses how Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. It states that, ''The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features [like] valleys, mountains, and craters.'' Meaning it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus is also the second planet from our sun.

Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds, which could lead to planetary visits. ''The differences in speed mean that sometimes we ae closer to Mars and other times Venus.'' Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and no spacecraft survuved the landing for more than a few hours. Venus has proven to be a very challanging place to examine more closely.

There are inhancements that NASA are trying to improve for differnt approaches to studying Venus. The author exclaims, ''A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.''

An example of what NASA is trying to do is to create simplified electronics made of silicone carbide that have been tested to in a chamber that stimulates Venus's surface; this electronic has survived three weeks in such conditon. What's even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. So imagine exposing a cell phone to acid or heat capable of melting tin.
