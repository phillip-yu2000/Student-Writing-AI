I think it would be cool to have a driverless car. I would say that even in a driverless car, the driver should still be able to take control when needed. I think we should keep it to where the driver could take control whenever, because of road construction. I would say that a driverless car, with also control of a driver would be fine.

I would say it's fine because, Google has drove driverless cars under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than hald a million miles without a crash. I think they are saying it is safe. Also, the Google cars aren't actually driverless because, they are alerted when to do something. These alerts are for example, when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, as in roadwork or accidents.

I think it would be cool to have one when you need to answer an emergency call. It will be safe to answer the call, because if you need to take control it will alert you. If someone was injured, I would say it would be the manufacturers fault. I would say it's the manufacturers fault, because they are the ones who made it, they were in control of making the car the whole time.

I would say a driverless car would be safe, in only some conditions. These conditions would be, when the car alerts the driver when they need to step in and drive. Another condition would be where the car would know where the road construction sites are, and would take the clear path to get to the destination of where the driver wants to go. Overall, I would say that a driverless car is safe.
