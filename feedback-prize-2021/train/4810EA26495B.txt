Student who live far or have a hard time learning will not help them succeed with there classes Teachers are feeling worried about there Student and they try everything to help. So the Teacher report to the Principal and notice the score are very low. They have to find a way to make there student successful, so they had a meeting and suggest that Student should do there assignment at home they called Home School.

Home school is a program to allow Student to do there homework, quizzes, assignments, and tests. This program help the Student to become successful, Student give there thought about home school and they say is more easy then School. What good about home School that you can stay at Home, eat your lunch watch T.V, and you will still have time to do your assignment on time.

But some other Student didn't want to be home school because they feel them self bored in home. They don't get to make friends, they need help with their assignments, They won't get the information they need. Student often get Home School because they probably don't have schools in there location but Parents want the best for there kids to have a good education so they gotta do whatever it takes to have there kids to become successful in the future.

If I was in the position or suggestion on the issue I would let the Student know to should take regular school. Because you will have better chances to succeed better then home school you will still have your friend in fact they can even help you with your assignments, even better chances to get to college with Teacher help you will know more information to be ready in the future. Student still suggest to be in Home School Because is still a good program to in to help be successful but not in the future People should take School more seriously if they want the better chance.
