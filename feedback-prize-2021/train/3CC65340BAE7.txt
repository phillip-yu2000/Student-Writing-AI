Technology is evolving and its evolving fast, for the fact that now we have a computer that may read students faces to determine if they lost interest and than alter the thing they are looking at. We will be talking about what this technology could leade to, what it may mean for schools, and how positive it may be.

Now this technology is quite advanced but, could it be a little far? Personally i feel this technology could be something positive in our lives but it could leade to many bad things. People will start relying on their computer to make them happy, people who have loved ones may just use a computer to read their emotions rather than actually trying to figure it out.

Schools are always trying to keep students happy, or willing to learn. But they seem to always lose their interest, so maybe it will help classes and maybe help advance students to a better grade or maybe even get them somewhere were they feel intrigued in. It could also help for the fact of students who are angry, helping them relax or putting them in a different situation.

This technology is very positive but still has its down sides. In my eyes, I see this as something negative for the fact being that humans need to try and reach someones heart and know them. We cant have technology just tell you if someone is happy or if they upset. You wouldnt really get any experience in social skills.

So to end this off, i do not agree of having this. This technology will end social skills and hurt schools for the fact of no one would be used to one another. Social skills is one skill everyone needs to have, learn, and use on a day to day bases.
