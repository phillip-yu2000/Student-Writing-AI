My thoughts on the " Facial Action Coding Sytems" is that it may work but it also may not work cause we can't always count on technology to tell us if it's right or wrong, or true or false. The " Facial Action Coding System" is supposed to tell the reader how you feel with percentages on happiness, sadness, madness and even fear and depression.

We dont really need this machine cause it can put out false information to see how you really feel. Say you are actually really happy and you arent sad at all but then you go to the machine and it tells you that you are 70% mad, 15% sad 10% fearful, and 5% happy. That is putting out false information on how you really feel because you feel happy.

When you look at someone you can usually tell how someone is feeling by there facial gestures. We don't need the "Facial Action Coding System" to tell us how someone is really feeling and most of the time if you ask how someone is feeling they will tell you they will be straight up with you. They will behappy that someone actually cares enough to know how they feel.

Personally i don't think we need the "Facial Action Coding System" because that is a waste of money and research. Why would we do research on something that we can go up to someone and ask them how they are feeling we dont need percentages or anything to wild we just need a simple answer like "i'm fine how about you?" or " I'm good how about yourself?" or " I'm fantastic, How are you feeling on this wonderful day?"

I think it is a waste of money to do research on something we can do in person when we ask someone how they are feelig today. You just have to ne polite and nice when you ask someone on how they are feeling. Just cause the " Facial Action Coding System" tells you the persentages on how you fell doesnt mean anything because for all we know it can be false and it can produce false information on how you are feeling so to end this off i don't think we need the " Facial Action Coding System".
