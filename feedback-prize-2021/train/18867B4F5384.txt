There are some advantages of limiting car usage. For exampple, it can cause a lot of pollution, traffic jams in small cities, and thr greenhouse gas emissions.

First of all, the advantages of limiting car usage is pollution. The passage states that "Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." Meaning that, Paris had to ban driving because there was so much polution going on. Pollution is one of the biggest problems in the United States today. And most of the people argue about it when it's actually them causing all of it.

In addition, the reason why they limit car usage is because in some small countries like, Colombia can cause a lot of traffic jams. The passage states that, "Bogota, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." also, in the passage it discussed that, "The turnout was large, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on Bogota. Meaning that cars were causing all of the rain showers and that is why Colombia banned cars for one day only to decrease the traffic jam and to do somthing about the rain showers that is happening daily.

Lastly, one of the advantages of limiting car usage is because of the greenhouse gas emissions. The passage states that, "President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week." Meaning that when a lot of people are using gas.
