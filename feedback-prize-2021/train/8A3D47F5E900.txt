There are many positive and negative outcomes that could come from the driverless cars. I believe driverless cars shouldn't be created for public use because they'd be a waste of money and energy. They'd be a waste of money because they aren't really needed to help society progress. They would also be a waste of energy because people are wasting time trying to prefect them when we don't really need them. Driverless cars would also take alot of resouces,like metals and cables, that could be used on more important things that we could actually benefit from. Some car manufacturers could cause more harm to people rather than helping them because they're not fully prefecting the cars and it causes more damage than neccessary. I also believe we shouldn't have driverless cars because people will spend too much time on these cars and changing the driving laws that even if they may think the car will know what to do at every moment if an accident occurs they still won't know who to hold responsible if someone is injured.

If the cars were released to the public then the time it'd take to change the laws would give time for the cars to malfunction even more. They'd also waste time and money trying to make the roads compatable with the cars by using electric wiring instead of the basic roads we use now. Finally I think we shouldn't have these cars because even if they do perfect them then safety will only be provided 90 precent of the time making the chances of an accident higher and they would cause more navagational problems.
