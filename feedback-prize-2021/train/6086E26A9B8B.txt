When a friend asks you for advice, you know you're not going to be the only one being asked. Greek philosopher Cicero once said ," Taking your own advice is better than taking someone else's." I disagree with that, I agree that taking multiple peoples advice is better because it helps you make better choices, and teaches you how to be open minded.

Firstly, I believe asking multiple people is better because it helps you make better choices. One way that it helps you make better choices is that it is more opinions to choose from. When you take your own advice there is a slight chance that it would be an impulsive one depending on the situation, but when you take others there is a more likely chance of it being a responsible decision. Another reason to why it helps you make better choices is that you keep yourself out of trouble. A reason to that is that when you ask others their going to have your best interest at heart and give you a better option to work with.

Secondly, you should ask for others advice because it teaches you to be open minded. The reason to why I say this is that when asking for others advice you're taking their word for it, in which your mind is open to other possibilities. Another reason is to how it teaches you to be open minded is your mind would be exploring other options.

In conclusion, you should ask multiple people for advice since it's better because you get better options and it teaches you to explore other possibilities.
