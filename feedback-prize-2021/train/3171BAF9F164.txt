Well in my opinion the Seagoing cowboys is pretty fun because you get to go on adventures and see nice things all around the world also you get to help animals from getting sick and dying also you get to go on ships an sail to other countries and you probelly get to fight in wars like i said you get to go around the world like to China ,Italy ,New oreleans ,Greece, Europe and ect. so yea you get to go almost everywhere only if you get in seagoing cowboys program . But also there is a good and a bad thing about this program i already told you the good things now it's time for the bad stuff well when you go on the adventure it's going to take you abundance of days to get where you need to be. Do you want to know why it takes you a long time ? Thats because you are going to be riding on a ship yes thats right a ship .Now thats going to take you forever to get where you need to be .

Well seagoing cowboys program is a good way to start off because you're doing things for yourself and your helping other animals to so thats a really good idea you should think about today . and i almost forgot you have to be an hard worker to be in this program so that is my amazing ways why you should be in this great opprotunity .
