Electoral college should be banned. Many people say that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close elction in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. So let me give you some facs about why electoral college should be banned.

Furthermore,Another reason why electoral college should be banned is because under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kery.

For Instance,Another reason why electoral college should be banned is because legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people back in 1960,.Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

In Conclusion,I think electoral college should be banned because its unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing on the tight races in the "swing" states. So this is why electoral college should be banned.
