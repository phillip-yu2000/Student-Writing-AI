I think in my opinion we shouldnt have driverless cars. It makes it seem like we're lazy. We dont need driverless cars because we all know how to drive. So does taking your permit does not matter? Since we have someone else to drive with us? So does that mean we dont have to learn about the saftey and the law of driving? So will everyone in the future not learn how to drive but will have driverless cars?

In this article is it says it can be dangerous.

As it states on paragragph 9. " If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault? The driver or the manufacture. Guys, You guys cant always depend on things being done by its self. we already have alot of advantages in this world adn u guys wanna make a driverless car? It's smart but we need to learn how to do stuff on our own and not depend on other things or someone else.

So yes, This is my opinion. This is how i fell about this. I certainly dont agree on this. Once again this is just my opinion. If you dont agree then i wont be mad. Everyone has their own opinions.
