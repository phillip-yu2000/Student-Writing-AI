Dear Senator,

I urge you to change to elrection by popular vote. I feel that we have out grown the Electoral College and need a change. I think it would be more fair for everybody to if we elect a president by popular vote because of the disaster factor. Electors could always defy the will for people. It is possible with the Electoral College That the most popular vote could no go to the most popular vote.

Does it seem fair that people will not get  whome the majority vote for. The fact that this could happen scares me to be quite honest. The Electoral College is out dated and irrational. Even the best argumentsin favor are without much basis in reality.

I ask you to rethink the Electoral College. It is outdated and I think that we need a change. This change could be really benificial and would be in everyones best intrest.
