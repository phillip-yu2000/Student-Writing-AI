Dear Principal :

I writing to you because of the way we do community service. I think every one needs to do community service it will help our town ,and our school if some one wants to help make a different. They can by helping kids they can help their grade improve and move up their grades. If they wanted to help around the school to make it better then they can do it. Just by cleaning and recycling can ,and plastic bottles we don't need. It can make a very big different at SCHOOL_NAME. More people can help us the best of their abilities. Just think of it if we can let this happen our school ,and whole town can look great and be better at what it does. It would be a honor to do any thing for the town of Winfield . Or the state of Alabama.

I hope we can make a very big change not just in our town ,but maybe even our country .So think you for your time and concern. Its not just it. Will start to help all the other towns in America or Alabama to make a change. Hope we can get that far. In what we are trying to accomplish .

Thanks, STUDENT_NAME
