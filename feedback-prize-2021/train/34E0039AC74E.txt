Dear TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, cell phones are probably the most important invention in the history of the world. Most of today's teens have one and use it daily. We all need to think about whether we should completely ban cell phones from the school, or if we should permit them only during free times.

Definitely, policy one, to allow students to bring phones to school and to use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a much more reasonable rule when it comes to using cell phones during school hours.

For one thing, giving them this freedom could make students more responsible, because the school could learn how the students deal with this freedom, to see if they abuse it or not. If students still have their cell phones on during class, we can easily tell that they cannot handle this kind of freedom. But there is no reason why we shouldn't test it out, to see if they are.

Even though cell phones are usually used for calling and texting your friends, teens use cell phones to also communicate with their parents. This could be telling parents when their sport practice ends, or where they're going after school. If parents do not get information like this about their child, they could get very worried. So this could be beneficial to parents as well as the students.

In conclusion, cell phones are a necessity to some people, and some barely use theirs. But we all know that when you are a teenager, all you do is use your cell phone. You should let us have our freedom to use our cell phones during class.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
