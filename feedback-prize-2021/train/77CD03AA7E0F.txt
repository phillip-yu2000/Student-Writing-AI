Some schools require students to participate in extracurricular activities. However, schools dont think it all the way through on how it will affect its students. Some students come home from school exhausted. On top of that, they still have homework and other after school activities. A required extracurricular activity may interfere with a students after school activities and some students may just not want to participate.

Most students play sports. Extracurricular activities can affect attendance at practices and games. Students also play instruments and do other activities outside of school. It may interfere with completion of homework. Some students even have jobs that they have to attend to. Overall, its not a good idea as it will interfere with almost everything and anything students do after school.

After school students may just not want to go. They already spend 7+ hours at school everyday. Students might be tired and just want to relax at home. They might want to hangout with their friends or spend time with family. They might not even care about the extracurricular activity so they dont participate. All in all, students that dont want to go probably wouldn't show up.

In conclusion, I disagree and believe that extracurricular activities shouldn't be required. If you want to stay after school then thats your choice not the schools. Schools that have this required should change it to optional. Students may not want to participate and students already have activities out of school and the required extracurricular activity will interfere with it.
