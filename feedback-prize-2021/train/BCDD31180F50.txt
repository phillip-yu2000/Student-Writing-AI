Phones & Driving

People driving while looking at their phones has become an epidemic and is a big cause of a lot of accident. Primarily involving teens who are so distracted by their phones that they are not paying any attention to the road. With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.

If you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger. Looking away from the road for even just 2 seconds can be the difference between life and death because one moment the roads might be clear and the next you could be rolled over trapped in your car.

When you are on your phone while driving, you are not only putting your life in danger but the lives of everyone around you on the road and possibly even pedestrians on the side of the roads. There are many deferent alternatives to being on your phone while driving, such as Bluetooth enabled devices that connect to the car so that you can still talk on the phone without using your hands. Another alternative is if you have a passenger, for them to read you the information and relay it back for you. That is just a few ways to avoid staying on your phone while driving
