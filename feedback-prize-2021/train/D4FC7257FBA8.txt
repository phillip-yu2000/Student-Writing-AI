Dear principal,

I believe that the cell phone policy should be that we can use cell phones during free-time. Most students use cell phones right now and there not suppose to, so imagine that you say

-No cell phones are allowed at school no matter what. Kids will bring there cell phones anyway and ignore the rules, and they don't care if they get into trouble or not.

-Yes, you can bring cell phones but only for the free-time given during school, and during classes the phones must be turned off. The students will listen a little bit better although some may use there phone's for free-time then just keep there phone on during classes, but that's better than sneaking a phone around school when your not even allowed phones in school.

Even if we were allowed to use our phones during free time I think that we should only be able to text, but I don't think that we should be able to call people. Because if there is an emergency of some kind than you shouldn't be on the phone, and if a teacher or someone is trying to talk to you, you shouldn't be on the phone.
