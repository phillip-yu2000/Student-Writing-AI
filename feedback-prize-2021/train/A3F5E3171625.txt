In the article,"Driverless Cars Are Coming," there is an abdunant amount of reasons why these cars with the idea of driveless cars is absolutly absurd. The idea for the car itself is a ton of money just to build it. Then to add "smart-roads system"(3) would add thousands of more dollars to go to waste. If the money issue is not a concern, then what about the idea of still having to assist a car that is suppose to be "driverless"?

The cars themsevles would cost a fortune to make but "smart-roads systems"(3) would cost too much money for anyone person to pay. Now the car itself would be too much money because of the need of so many sensors. With an estimated guess, there would have to at least 11 different types of sensors to be place in one car. Even with thousands of dollars going into the driverless cars, they still have not found a way to have a completely driverless vehicle. Different cars call for different driver's assistance. Some "make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel,"(7) while others will send a signal to the driver such as, vibrating the seat, announcing to driver that they "should be prepared to take over"(7), and others have flashing lights. Which means that in no way is this car driverless if it some how requires the drivers help with driving.

These cars would cost one person, a lot of money that they do not have. Even the safe-road system that has not even been made would cost even more then the car itself. If that was not enough, then what about the fact that these cars are not driverless... the driver still needs to help driving. These reasonings just help with the understanding that these cars is just something that is not needed in this world.
