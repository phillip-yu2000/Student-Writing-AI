The author has great supports about why we should study the planet of Venus. He called it Earth's twin. He stated that Venus is the closest planet to be comapred to Earth. The author states that blimp-like vehicles would help with the study of Venus.

The author said Venus is Earth's twin because it's the closest planet to have the same density and size as Earth. The author states that we could use blimp-like vehicles to not get burnt or crushed because if the vehicle gets 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape everything would change. The temperature would drop from about 800 degress to 170 degress Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure would drop from 90 times greater than earths surface to about Earth's sea level if the vehicle were to be 30 miles or so above the surface.

All you need to know why we need to study Venus more is all here. Venus is basically Earth's twin so why not study it more. Venus is the closet planet to be compared to Earth with its size and density. Blimp-like vehicles would help with it's flight to 30 miles or so. It would help with the temperature and the atmospheric pressure. Do you have anything to debate about these facts?
