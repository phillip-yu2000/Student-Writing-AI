Say you were a complete sports freak. You were involved in every sport the school had to offer. In school you maintained a C to an B+. You then hear that the principal is changing the school's policy. The new policy is. If you average below a B, you will no longer will be able to participate in any sports until you raise your grade. You missed the cut by one grade because your average is now a B-.

If I were you I would be very upset about that because an average grade is a C, and that's what some of the sports players get. I realize that the principal is trying to push the school to be at a higher level but this is outrageous. I do agree that most students need to focus and try a little bit harder on there school work, but this is too much too soon.

If I were the principal I would turn study halls into classes where kids that need the extra help can get some help. For instance, if there are kids in study hall that have all of their work done and are willing to help. They could help those kids get there work done and most likely they would start doing better.

The teachers could also help us by explaining more or getting into more detail or even giving us more time to finish assignments in class. They don't need to get too carried away with it but help the kids make more progress. Another good idea would be to have teachers that are willing to stay after school to help the kids that need help. The teachers and students could stay and hour or two after school and I'm sure that would help most students.

We aren't all geniuses and some of us do need help, but making school that much harder is something that I have to disagree with, and these are some of the ways we could also help make to school a little smarter.
