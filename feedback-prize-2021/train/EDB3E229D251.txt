MOO! There are many animals a seagoing cowboy has to care for and deliver.

I Luke Bomberger was asked by my friend Don Reist to try out the program. Being a seagoing cowboy is a lot of fun, you can do a lot of things as one. You help people in need by giving them things they need. There are many reasons to join the seagoing cowboy program.

I started out by heading to Greece, and I turned eight-teen. I was old enough to be drafted then, but when my draft board figured out I was on a cattle boat they said to keep doing it as my draft service. When I was discharged I had made nine trips. I had went to Europe and China when I was a seagoing cowboy. I had fallen once, but I didn't go overboard. During your trips you have to care for the animals, by feeding them and giving them water.

When you're not working, you can do many things, like play games, read, and even fence. You can also see some places off the boat. When I was little I used to help out on my aunt's farm. It helped prepare me for being a seagoing cowboy. I had a lot of fun being a seagoing cowboy, because there were so many things to do.

You should be a seagoing cowboy, because you will be able to care for many animals, and you can see other countries. You can also play games to pass the time between trips. Being a seagoing cowboy would be the time of your life. You could help others while having fun yourself. It is a great program that helps others.

There are many reasons to join the program, like the ones I just mentioned. You can spend your time having fun, or you can just try it out to see if you like the program. You might end up how I started, by trying it out and end up liking it. You should join the program, because it helps people in need. In the future there might be other programs like this one.
