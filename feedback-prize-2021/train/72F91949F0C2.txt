You should Participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to see and experience sites that not everyone gets to see, like Acropiles in Greece, tour a castle in Crete, and be marvled at the Panama Canal as you head to China, and you get to see even more there! The Segoing Cowboys program is a program that takes food and animals to China and Eroupe after World War Two.

After you take the food and animals to China and Eroupe, you get to have fun on your way back to America. You could play baceball and volleyball in the empty holds were they kept the animals, or you have

Table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and that passes the time on that long time back home.

Just be Carefull you do not wan't to go over board into the merky depths of the cold Antlantic Ocean. Also, you don't want tho slide down the ladder of the ship, you won't go over, you would just break a few ribs and not be able to care for the animals.

That is why I think you should join the seagoing cowboys program, and all in all, it is a good time!
