Is it a good idea to let teachers use technology to describe students emotional expressions? To me I say that it is wrong to examine kids emotional expressions because teacher should worry about their ow feelings. They shouldn't be worrying about other students.

Technolgy can be wrong in many ways but this type of technolgy invades students personal space. They feel emotional in lots of different ways because of different reason. The technolgy we use to describe student emotional expressions is smart, but it is wrong to do.

We should not use technology to describe emotional expressions. There is aonther way to describe someones emotional expression by mimicking their facial expressions. All you need to do is try to to make your face look just exactly like your friend then tell what he might be feeling. There are many ways to describe someones emotional expression just by not using technology.

In conclusion, I say that using technology to describe emotional expressions of a students is wrong. It mainly invades their personal space. The technology we use is smart but completely wrong.
