Dear,TEACHER_NAME

I think your new plan to keep kids from playing sports or other extracurricular activities is outrages. Kids like myself play sports and other activities ti find a way our of the daily stress of school and social drama might i add. It is ridiculous that you should withhold things that we cherish the most in order for us to have to take on more work then what is usually some of us may have learning disabilities or we do the work and the teacher doesn't answer our questions in class to the full extent. Have you thought of an alternative then just take away our escape from reality these activities are keeping us from running the streets like a bunch of hood rats and hoodlums.

I think you should think of an alternative then just to take away what our means of therapy is maybe one day out of the week we could not practice and just do a study hall. Or you may just sit us out for a game or the 1st quater/first half to motivate us to do better and achieve better in ourselves. Some of us may just be to depressed or mad to simply just try to bring up our grades if we cant ensure that we will play.

In conclusion on the behalf of the student body at SCHOOL_NAME i think you should fine another way to motivate us to bring our education to a higher level.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
