I would favor changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The president is more important than the electors. Who knows if the electors are being paid to choose a president? The people vote for what they want and need. The people should get what they want, not what the electors want. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

To begin with, the electoral college is not fair! For example, you can have 500 people voting for you, but then your opponent has 55 electors voting for him. Then most likely your opponent would win you but why should he win you if you had more people voting for you? That is really unfair. Also its like a winner-take-all system.

Therefore, the electoral college is out of date. We are in the 2000's, not the 1960's gentlemen. This system is very old style, it was even used back in the 1960's when segregationists almost replaced the Democratic electors. This electoral college is a disaster factor. All it does is makes things harder and worse for the state.

All of these reasons is why we should get rid of the elecotral college and change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral vote is just not fair to anyone. It is so old styled which should be changed. Its a really bad system thats hould be removed. The electoral college should be changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.
