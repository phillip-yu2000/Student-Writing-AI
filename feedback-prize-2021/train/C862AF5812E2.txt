When people ask for advice they ask for it because their in a bad situation. And they relly need it the most. They mainly ask people they trust and know. Because they know the most about them. And they know the best ways to help them. They mostly go to family members and close friends. Sometimes if they are in school they go to a trusted adult. Like the guidance consular, a teacher, principal, and the police officer if they have one at the school.

The reason people ask for advice because they dont know how to do things right. And they are they are probably not feeling well. it could be something going on at home they need help with. things like their mom and dad are probably going through something, somebody in their family passed away, or their just going through rough times. And they dont know how to deal with it they just need some help and advice on how to deal with the situation. And it not bad to ask for help and advice.

It is a good thing to ask multiple people. Because their is different kind of situations. You never know what the situation is or how bad it is. Asking multiple people you can figure out which one is the best and see if that fixes the problem. So if that doesnt then you got the other peoples ideas to help the problem out. And their always there for you to help you out with anything if you need them the most. Plus iit never hurts to ask for advice mainly when you need it the mostly.
