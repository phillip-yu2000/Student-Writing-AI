Do you ever feel like you need to ask multiple people for advice? This is something people do everyday to make sure what they are doing is going to benefit them or hurt them. When we ask for advice its always better for you to ask more than one person because it gives you more to think about if this is really what needs to happen or is this just a waste of my time. It also can help you chose the best way to go forth with your plan. Second, it makes you think if the advice you was giving is going to affect you in a positive manner. For example, I once ask if I was to move to a new family are they going to help me finally settle down my journey in Foster Care or are they just going to be a set up. So, this made me talk to many social workers, because I want to have what was best for me and my future.

Third, When you get the advice that you need you are able to narrow down you choices and chose what is going to work the greatest. This will also make that feeling in your gut disappear because you will know what your doing won't effect you negatively. Also when talking to someone for advice like you mom, dad,or grandparent they will tell you advice that will truly benefit you and help you succeed in your life because they will only want what is the best for you, which makes it easier to plan out the best option for yourself. In other words, asking more than one person is best because it helps you figure out what is best for you and your future.
