the policy change should not happen when it come to kids and there sports they take it seriously they want to be just like there idols they want to do something great many kids are not able to learn they think their nothing because it is hard for them to lear and one thing they think there good at is there sports the policy should be that if a child is playing sports and has lower than a c he has to take after school tutoring and at least stay in a c area the kids play sports so they feel better about them selves they like it there good at it they want to be the school hero and get wins but in class the struggle the just don't get the work it confuses them a they try hard but its some after school tutoring they need to kick some one of a team is pretty harsh they want to be on that team the work holds them back besides it puts a lot of pressure on them because they have a lot of work form about 6 or 7 classes each asking them to do specific big projects that can take weeks to make they also have to do homework read and they have practice for there sports the policy change is just going to hurt them even more on there grades they need the sports to keep them on track it teaches self-discipline and hard work that pushes them to do better on every thing even there school work that policy is basically asking the kids to know it all or they wont be on the team its pressuring a b is pretty high near an A its just hard trying to maintain all of that school work because you forget things easily the policy should not change if a child who plays sports is failing a class is required to take a after school tutoring session
