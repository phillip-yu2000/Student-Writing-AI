Dear Principal,

I think people should have a choice of doing community service or not doing community service.

I think they should have a choice because no one knows how busy there life is after school. Some people are very busy after school and don't have time to do other work.

Some people have a lot of time after school and should do work to help the community.

If they do have time to do community work I think they should also be recognized with a certificate or something in that general area.

If they don't have time then they should work on freeing up there schedule for relaxing.

That is because no one likes an angry stressed out person.

If people want to do community work instead of serving detention I think they should be allowed to because after all they are helping the community, and it might be a punishment for them if they don't like to help out at all.

If people volunteer to help out the school as community work I believe that you should let them it will help make the outside of the school look better.

If someone wants you to help out i think you should get recognized for that to because adults don't get recognized for as much as kids do.

I also believe that if the school should allow a club or something to do community work if we have enough people that think it is that important.

I would also like to bring to your attention that some people are trying they're hardest to get out there and work but don't have the time I wish we had a class for that to so you can help them relax and not always be stressed out about it.

I hope you take my suggestions into consideration.

Sincerely,

Student
