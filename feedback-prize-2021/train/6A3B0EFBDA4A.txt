Dear

TEACHER_NAME,

I think that our school should be able to use our phones during free time, lunch or recess. phones should be allowed because many students cant live without their phones and need them all the time. What if something happens in school and you need your phone to call your parents or someone you know to come help you. Their are many people that cannot live without their phones. I know a couple of students that always have to have their phones with them. I always see them with their phones. And when i do see them they are always texting or calling people. But they do it by hiding it from teachers. this is why being able to use your phones in school is a huge thing for middle school students and high school students.

It is also a good idea to use the phones in free time or in lunch so no one bothers you or no teacher asks you for your phone. And what if something happens in your school that you need to call your parents or someone related to you to go pick you up or call the police such as a lock down when someone comes into our school or their is a fire. Your phone would be very helpful in those situations. If your in a lockdown and no one knows where you are because your hiding and your lock down is over and you don't know you can call your paretns to go help you and call the school or something.

But before every class starts the teachers should make sure that every students phones are off . They should do that because many students try to text each other during their classes . That's not fair for the teachers because they spend their time trying to teach you something and your texting. Their are a couple students that i know that love to text and use their phones in school. They would probably love to hear that they can use their phones in school during free time or in lunch, I know i would. And
