I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity a year. If a student partakes in one extracurricular activity a year it might make students want to come to school or make them want to learn more.

For example if a student participates in the student council they would learn more about leadership,independence and authority which would also make those people better members of society if they had ever been a part of the student council.

Another reason I agree with the rule is because if a student was a part of working on the yearbook it would help students be organized,work with others and be more involved with the school and teachers and all the students as well and the people that participated in making the yearbook might use the skills they learned in that activity in there profession when they get older.

My last reason sports,sports are a extracurricular activity and most people would choose this as there one activity I know I would but if people choose sports there are so many choices such as football,baseball,soccer,track,etc. students will learn teamwork and how to be competitive and any and every one can play a sport its fun and it is healthy keeps you fit and can also be a way to be happy if your feeling down.

All of this is why I agree with the principal on making it so every student has to participate in at least one extracurricular activity for reasons of learning being healthy and being a over all a better member of society.
