I don't like this policy because some people have a 79 average and now they cant play sports because they are not a B point average. This is also a stupid idea because sports are suppose to be fun and its a privilege to play sports . You should not make it a B or A point average because a C is not bad. Your not failing or about to fail so there's no point. You should base it on how they do in class and how they act up. you should also see if they act up during the program. You should not look at their grades if they are higher than a C because that person could be gone for along time or the teacher will be gone for alone time. So that makes your your grade go down or stay there, it wouldn't go up. When the teacher comes back he or she wouldn't have the time to put all the grades in or she/he he doesn't get to your paper(s) or your class yet. This is a unfair rule and should be thought over again or think of a new thing policy.
