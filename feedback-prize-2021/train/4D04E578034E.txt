In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the authour said Venuse is often referred to as Earth's twin. So well alot of people would think that it means they are the same, wrong as said in the article Venus gets up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit on the planet's surface and the atmosphere is made up of mostly 97% carbon dioxide that blankets Venus.

The resend Astronomers are fasinated by Venus is because is is the plant most like Earth. They beleive that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. If Venus once had life, and water what could have happened to Venus could happen to Earthso studying Venus could posibale halp us save Earth from having the same fate.

So in the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," yes it has its challenges just like everything we do on Earth or in space. Just like in the article it said that the surface of Venus is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, so to solve this challenge the good people at NASA are trying to find something that can withstand the heat and still be able to bild a space shadal out of it. As some as we can get someone on Venus and keep the alive we will be able to get the anwers that we need to know. So despite the dangers and challenges we face I think the same as the author we should try are best to find out as much as we can about our sister plant.
