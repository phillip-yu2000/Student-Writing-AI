The best thing you can come up with is aliens?

That sounds like a very lazy excuse.

Of all the things you could've said, you said aliens.

There's more proof that it is just a formation other than an alien.

Your mind will change after you read this.

By the way, do you realize that the "Face of Mars" is a pop star?

First off, there is no trace of aliens on the planet.

NASA has been saying for years that it wasn't aliens that did it.

Why would NASA lie to the whole world?

Also, why would aliens make a human face?

It is just a huge rock formation that resembles a human head and that has been proven.

These kinds of thoughts always happen because of the media.

They always make something different from what it really is.

Now a lot of people think that NASA is keeping information from them, and that there is life on mars.

Whenever the media gets the chance to say something about aliens, they always take that chance.

Why do you people listen to everything you see or hear?

Isn't it dumb to think alien exists?

Let's be honest, what real proof do we have of aliens?

The fact the huge rock formation looks like a human face is just a coincidence.

Just because something has to do with space, doesn't mean aliens have to be a part of it.

Aliens are not in space so deal with it.

Sorry to upset you but we have to face facts.

Also if there were aliens, it would be best if the world didn't know.

But there are no aliens so we don't have to worry about that.

Face the facts because they don't exist.

Don't be a media follower because they are full with false rumors.
