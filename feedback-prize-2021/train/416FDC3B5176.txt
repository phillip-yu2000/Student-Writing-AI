In the article " Making mona lisa smile" the author describes how a new tecnology called Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The real question is does this have a value in the set of a classroom? If you think about what this would do for the rest of the world it is great but would it be good in school classroom? In the school teachers know if you are confused or mad they see you expresion on your face. Teachers are in the classroom to help you understand and learn what is being teached to you.

One of the many reasons why the facial acting coding systeam technology is not a valueable in a classroom is because it does not help when you are given an assignment on paper and a book and if you are confused you ask a teacher to help you a technology will not help you solve the confusen it will just tell you are confused. Another reson is it is very unuseful to what you do during school hours because you work durning school hours that does not help the work ethic you put into your education. Lastly it does not help you graduate if you use a facial action coding systeam it justa systeam that you can have fun with and know how you are feeling.

The Facial Action Coding System is a usless system that does not help you growth in learning in school. You do not need it to graduate to the next grade. Also it does not help you to use it if you have a question on an assignment , homework or test that is what a teacher is for to help you solve your questions.

The Facial Action Coding System just scans your face and tells you if you are happy, sad, mad, scared or any other word to desrible your express. This system is a usless system and should not be in a classroom.
