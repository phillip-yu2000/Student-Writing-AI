The reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because if you do join you get to explore the world and help people while doing that. The best part is that you get to work with and help animals such as horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So if you like to help and have fun then this program is for you!

Also you get to go across the ocean on a ship and get to receive orders from people to go to places to help and stuff. It could take up to two weeks to get to your destination. Or even a month depending on where you are going for example if you start at the eastern coast of the United States and went all the way to china it could take up to a month!

This program is a great opportunity if you want an awesome adventure and a great time in general. So just remember the name Seagoing Cowboys if you want to join.
