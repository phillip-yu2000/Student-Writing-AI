In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" it was talking about Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is actually a planet it has a nickname called Evening Star.

Venus is the second planet from our sun often referred to as Earth twin. Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too. They are trying to land a spaceship on Venus its been three decades that a spaceship has landed on Venus. Its becoues the on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. They are studying Venus becoues long ago Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. Venus has rocky sediment and includes familier features such as valleys, mountains,and craters. NASA is trying to send men up to Venus to studying it but they are trying to bulid something that hovers over Venus and they can studyng it. NASA is working on other approaches to studyng Venus.

Venus is a planet to know about becoues that might be the next planet we might be living on. I think its a good thing to study on Venus becoues its a planet that might be closes to ours.
