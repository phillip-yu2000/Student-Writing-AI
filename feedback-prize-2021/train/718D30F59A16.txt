Opinions

When you need advice do you ask other for there opinions? I know I do all the time. Sometimes getting someone elses opinions helps me make a better choice. Here are reasons why seeking others opinions can help.

My first reasons is when your'e trying to make a choice or a decision you want others opinions. When you give yourself advice and it isn't enough. Going to a parent, teacher or even a friend can help you. People can give others really good advice. They can also see something from a different point of view. Which can sometimes change your mind about something or someone.

My second reason is others probably had to make choices that are similar to yours,so getting there opinion can help a ton. Also, getting one person opinion or getting none at all or just taking your own advice can't help you make a choice. Seeking multiple opinions helps me good choices that can help me now and later on. Also, some people may give you different opinions. Getting different opinions helps you think about your choices.

My last reason is you could also give someone else your honest opinion. They might need your help, because you may give really good advice. Also, if you have gone through the same problem or had to make a tough choice or decision you can give your opinion and help them through there problem.

In conclusion, I thnk getting others opinions or there piont of view can help you make better choices. Not getting any advice doesn't really help make decisions. Asking people who are close to you like your family, getting there opinion makes a difference than not getting any at all.
