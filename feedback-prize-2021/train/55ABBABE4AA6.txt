Changing the school policy for sports.

Sports are important to some students, and some find it hard to meet the demanding grades or expectation. The school policy should not be changed, and be kept the same. Changing the demand of a higher grade level is also not very fair to many students. It has many positive sides to it too, but my opinion is it should just be left the same.

Sports are very important to students in many schools. Some students take sports very seriously ,and sometimes get home very tired. Students not just in your schools but in schools across the nation do many sports. They me sometimes feel very wore out, or tired because of all that physical activity, and not do their homework. Raising the policy will not let students to show or be able to participate in their favorite activities.

Many students believe the policy should be changed, but in my opinion it should be left alone. The are many upsides to the policy changes and also down sides. One example could be that a student such as you or me try our hardest to meet the demanding grade already. Raising the demanding grades to participate in sports may lead to the loss of very talented athletes.

Changing the policy may be very unfair to students. They might believe that changing the policy is outrageous and just not right, and argue with many teachers about it. some students acknowledge the fact that the demanding grade is a c , and just should be left.

Leading to a higher exception is good , but not good in this situation.

This policy should not be passed or used. In my opinion i think some athletes find it very hard to meet school expectation's, as they are already. Athletes today make the demanding grade level and play sports, but in some cases others don't. Very gifted athletes might want to play a sport, but cant because of their grades, "that's not very fair". their are many ups and downs towards this policy, but i as a student believe it should just be left alone.
