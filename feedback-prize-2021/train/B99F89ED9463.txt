Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many people also drive a vehicle. When these two things are combined, they can be very hazardous to someone's life. Here are some reasons why you should not use a cell phone and operate a vehicle.

The main reason why you shouldn't use a phone while driving is because it is a distraction. The National Safety Council says that using a cell phone while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. People are often hit or run over by a car only because the drive was looking at their phone. So many accidents are caused by cell phone use, because when you are looking at the phone; you are not looking at the road.

There are numerous ways to prevent car accidents caused by cell phone use. Children need to be taught the dangers of using a phone and driving. In Georgia we have a law that says, "You have to have your phone in a cell phone holder while driving," if more states would do this we would be golden. And finally, you can use a Bluetooth earpiece, so you don't have to pick up or look at your phone to answer it. We know how to stop so why don't we stop it already.

When it comes down to it, using a cell phone while driving is one of the most dangerous things someone can do. When you're doing something as difficult as driving a car, the last thing you need is something to distract you. Preventing it is the best thing we can do right now. My grandma always tells me, "When it comes to a cell phone, just remember that no matter what it is, it can wait."
