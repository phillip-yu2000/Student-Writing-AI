Dear Mrs. Principal, I strongly believe that you should not put the policy of students needing to have at least a B average in order to play sports. I feel this way for a couple of different reasons. First of all, students that don't have good grades need to be able to play sports in order to keep them in school, and secondly many kids that have learning disabilities such as ADHD play sports, but can't keep their grades up.

Playing sports in school entices kids to go to school for the chance to play on the team. Many kids only go to school because they can play sports, and they know that if they stay in school and are good enough at their sport, they might get a chance to play at the collegiate level, and maybe even the professional level. Those kinds of kids don't really care too much about their grade, and playing sports makes school bearable for those kids. If they had to maintain a B average, most kids would drop out of school at the first chance they got, not try harder.

Secondly, some kids with learning disabilities love to play sports, even if they can't get good grades. Kids with ADHD or dyslexia could be very talented or just love to play sports, but wouldn't be able to if they had to keep their grades at a B. You would be robbing those kids of an opportunity to win the school respect, and an opportunity to make friends along the way.

Sure some kids would work harder in order to play, but I can almost guarantee that the majority of them wouldn't. It is much fairer the way it is now, where if you have two D's or one F, then you can't play until you bring your grades up, but it is simply unfair to expect all kids that want to play sports to maintain a B average,

Sincerely,
