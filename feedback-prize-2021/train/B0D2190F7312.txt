Getting mutable advise is better than one persons advise. This is because you have a better chance to get the right opinion, then the wrong opinion. Also my personal preference is to get everybody's opinion before doing something that will impact me. For example, one day I was very sick and asked if I should go to school or not my mom and my sister told me to go to school.

Another reason is that if you really want to do something that's not right you can get some other opinion's and see if you should do it or not. Like if your going to do something bad your friends or family can talk you out of doing it. There was one time that I really wanted to do something, but I knew it was not the right thing to do, I told my family about it and they talked to me about it. They said it was not right to do so I didnt do it, even know you really wanted to do it.

The only negative to multiple advise is that, you could get completely different answers then everyone else. If you had to pick something out from the store and your friend says to go buy candy and your over friend says go buy soda you don't know what to get so you are left confused and don't know what to buy. this problem could be solved if you just asked one person what to buy not mutable people. Over then that getting mutable advice the way to go.
