The Electoral College is not so much a place as a process, created by the founding fathers themselves. It consists of 538 electors and 270 votes, put forth by those electors, are required to elect President of the United States. The Electoral College should be vanquished.

Citizens don't always have control over whom the electors decide to support. This is a problem because voters are sometimes mislead with the electors and vote to elect the opposing candidate. In the year of 1960, those who supported segregation were extremely close to having electors that supported Kennedy replaced with new electors that supported the actions of segregationalists. These people attempted this because Kennedy would never actually recieve the popular votes if the votes were to be in favor of him.

In the sense that some might argue that the Electoral College is perfect the way it is, this is an invalid statement because the people of America don't realistically have a say in government decisions. The Electoral College doesn't help society, therefor it needs to be removed from our system. Citizens of the American society should decide the president, not electors that think the people aren't of a huge importance.Â
