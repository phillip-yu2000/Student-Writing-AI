I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program!

You can help people and animals recover their food supply. You also have time to look around at places you've never seen before.

Like Luke, he says "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable oppotunity." Luke had the side benefit of seeing Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice,

Italy. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. If you were to be a Seagoing Cowboy, you could have all these benefits too.

On return trips you can have fun by playing some games, like baseball and volleyball games. They also played Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

It can be a great adventure for you, but it can also open up the world to you just like it did for Luke. It changed Luke's life, and it can change your life too.
