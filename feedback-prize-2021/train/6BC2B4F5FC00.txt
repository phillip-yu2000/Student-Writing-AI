If schools do distance learning, I feel like most kids won't get any work done. If kids don't do homework or work in class, what makes you think giving them distance learning is a good idea? Some people will say "It'll give them the chance to be more independent, and learn to do things on their own." However most kids hate to do work, their all about sticking it to the man. So if they do the work it won't be done to their full potential. If no one is contently on them about somthinng they aren't going to get anything done. They want to have fun and be young, they don't want to do boring work. On the other hand, I feel like this could work. All you need is the right students, and you won't have to worry about a thing. This could be great for students, they could get more one on one time with their instructor, and get a better understanding of the assignment. They can get work done without having to worry about getting judged by their peers for getting a question wrong. They don't have to worry about in class distractions so they focus more and get work done more efficiently. They won't have a bell to govern how long they work. They can work at their own paciest, and be comfortable doing it. This could work if you do it the right way. It'll take a lot, getting the right kids to do it, but it could work out fine.
