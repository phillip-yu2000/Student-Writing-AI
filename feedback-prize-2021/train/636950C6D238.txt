I will be making an essay how the author supports the idea that studying Venusis a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Well Venus is actually the second plant on the Earth. Venus have challenging place to examine more closely. I really don't thing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite. What ever that means but the author has give us so many things about venus.

One reason that I have found in the passage is that Venus is more than three decades. Venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans could travel to the planet if Venus, but how will they come back home. Well I don't know how they will be going back home. Even more challenging are the clouds of hightly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. Most importantly reseachers well I mean the author cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth. It can sometime be our nearest option for a planetary visit. How I said in the beginning people can go to Venus for a trip, but how are they coming back home.

The second reason that I

have found in the passage is that NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Its solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Its not easy conditions but survivable for humans. Venus have never had a ship landing in that planet. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above the planet can provice only limited insight on ground. Because most forms of light cannot penetrate to Venus. This is in the passage,some simplifiled elecronica made of silicon carbide have been tested ina chamber simiulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted fro three weeks in such conditions.
