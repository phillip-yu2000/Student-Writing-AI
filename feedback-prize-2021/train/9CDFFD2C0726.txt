In "Driverless Cars are Coming" is a postive development for these cars and for humans. The law focus on being safe, going out of town the car can drive by itself, and also the car is used as a phone GPS and a lot more technology.

One of the reason why it's a good idea for these cars to develope. Is becuase laws are more worried about people being safe. With these cars that can drive by itself and have the technology that it needs they will never get into a reck. If they built cars like this with the technology of a smart phone and could be a new game changer. Even though some people will get bored of not driving its for there own good, they can always drive when they want too.

People might like it more when they go out of town becuase the car can take over and not have to worry about getting no sleep. Why stay up all night driving when they can have a car that can drive by itself without a problem? Most people don't get because they only see the bad in it which it has a lot of reasons why it's bad to let a car drive itself. But I'm supporting the goood side about it.

Techonolgy is a big part in this car if we have enough techonolgy to actually make this car really smart and careful out on the roads it could be great. Some cars already out that are smart. For example i saw a commercial about a car that stops by itself when the driver is not paying attention. And that's how most people crash because they either don't pay attention or they on there phones.

My point was that there is more great reasons why this car should be built. For the saftey, the trips, and the technology people learn new things when they try new things.
