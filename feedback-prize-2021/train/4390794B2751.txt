Dear Principal,

I think that policy 1 should be our rule. What happens if one of our family members got hurt or going to die. We should know all the updates that is going on. Principal or any other adult shouldn't take our phones right away they should give us a waring. If they are going to take the phone at least give it back at the end of school or class. If a parent cant pick the phone up give it to the student cause the parent isn't going to be able to pick it up. If u pay for the phone and pay for the bills then you are the only one that can have possession of the phone and no one can take it away from you.

The policy and the school should have a vote to have what policy in and out of our school. The voting should be base on our choice. The school doesn't pay for the bills so why should they take it away from us. If there is a weekend and the school has our phone how am i going to talk to someone in my family What happens if there an earthquake and the school has your phone. The school is going to be in trouble for that mistake.
