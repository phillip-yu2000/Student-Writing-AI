I think we should have phones through lunch time because what if our families is in danger on they told us to do something while u are in school, and you forget. That's a time to call your mother/father and ask them what you had to do, but i really understand that you cant have phones in class. It can mess you up doing your school. Do text or talk in class because you had an chance to do that in the lunch room. "What if i get cough?" If u get cough after they say you cant use your cell phone in class. You'll get it took up for the rest of the year. "DANT GET IT TOOK UP STUDENTS!" If anyone got something to say about your phone. Don't listen to them because they just mad that you got an phone, so be happy that you got an phone that you can use for talking to your girlfriend or mother or anyone that you can get in touch with. Now if you bring your phone to school just to be funny or play music. You don't need to be bring you r phone to school or it will took up or what ever TEACHER_NAME

wants to do with it. All i got to say is: if you bring you phone; you wont to use it. bring it for a reason
