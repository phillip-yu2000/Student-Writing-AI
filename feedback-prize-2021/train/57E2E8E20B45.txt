Phones and Driving

In the day of age, 25% of car crashes involve driving while using phones. That is a huge number and already 1 reason why you shouldn't drive while using a phone. I will give you some reasons why you shouldn't drive with phones.

Fatal injury or death is one reason. You are in a big metal vehicle in which case, can crash. When crashed, multiple things could happen to you. Burning, crushed, stabbed is few of the things that can injure, or kill you. Your not affecting youself, but affecting people who probably got hit while you crashed. You might have or had killed them.

Another is jail time or bieng sued. If you had hit a person, another car, or property damage, you can get arrested for that. The fine cost could go up to 500,000$ and a jail time for a minimum of 2 years.

Lastly, is hurting your family and friends. Say you're a father and your wife calls you. You have your best friend in the next seat and your kid in the back. Out of nowhere, a truck comes and you t-bone into the truck. Your kid has a brokin rib and your best friend is dead. Do you really want that to happen?

Morale of this essay is, never go on your phone when you drive. Don't answer texts, don't answer the phone, and don't look up things on the internet.
