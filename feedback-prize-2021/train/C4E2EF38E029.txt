stuudents shouls be slllowed to their own summer projects is valid. studedesign nts tend to have an impact on other students rather than teachers do on them. in a medern world like today things have defetly change inthepast couple of years; i understand that teachers are good at plannning and have great ideas but in theses times teens a control of their own future.

But what if fun and learing are not a good mix what it these kids start losing the whole purpose of the game and don't learn. I also undernd things from a teaachers perspective all they want to do is simply make sure their students learn wich at the end of the day both side wculanary in collage ant the same thing for students to learn. wit hthiother problem mental health to many games ,game adiction thebthetudeents take more control on their assignments ir students take ecaouse teachersy didnt learn anything but the game.

despite the fact that nobody understands a kid but a kid letting students desighn their own projects also helps them unlock their creative potential and as far as mental health these students are actually doing something productive and are occupied on something that is not their hand held devices. not only that kids are discovering things about themselves they had no idea about for example my cusin hateed cooking but when she toool culanary her teacher let the classswhat ever they wantes as a project for their final grade she made a suflay not only did she pass with a 100% she discovered that she liked cooking and wanted to study collage.

every day more and more kids are findind themselves likeing school teachers are letting their assignments.Â
