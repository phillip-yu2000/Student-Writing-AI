Have you ever imagined a world without drivers? Google cofounder Sergey Brin has envisioned public transportation systems that are driverless. Driverless vehicles is a bad idea because of, safety, more money being wasted in production, and driving itself.

First of all, the saftey of a driver is in danger when a computer takes over. At any given moment, the car can fail, and the driver can get injured. The text states, "The human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires." In the 21st century, we have cell phone. If a people already today use their phones while driving, imagine when driverless cars are introduced to the public. People will be paying more attention to their cell phones that the road.

Secondly, making these car will take a large amount of money. The text say that a Toyota Prius was modified with numerous cameras and sensors to make this driverless car mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Buying a car made with all those modifications will cost you. Also, adding more systems in the car such as, entertainment and information systems, will cost money too.

Driving was always fun to everybody, but with the idea of a driverless car, the fun goes away. "The phsychological aspects of automation are really a challenge." To fix the problem, BMW project manager says that they have to interpret the driving in a new fun way. BMW says they will add entertainments systems. That is a dumb idea because you need to be paying attention to the road.

Driverless cars, will become worse thorughout the course of its production. There will be failures within the car itself and the technology inside it. There will also be more problems to worry about, such as the systems breaking and the car breaking down. Do you really want to sit and watch a computer drive you to your destination?
