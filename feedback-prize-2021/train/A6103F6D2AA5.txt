Here are some reasons people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You get to move cattle,travel places,help people.

Traveling would be fun and here are some reasons why. Places, you could go to asia and see their art, or Europe and meet the people. Food, you could try exotic things like goat or fresh Polish sausge. People, you could meet new people and hang out with your new best german buddy eating goat.

Moving cattle would be fun ecpecially if you grew up doing it just like Luke did. You could get smarter by doing this you would know how much of what to give a horse or a cow for feed, and you would know how to clean a stall. If you ever retired you could go into cattle from this experience.

If you did this you could have the experience of traveling and cattle but the best one would be knowing you helped all those people stay alive milk and meat from the cows meat from the goat. everyone would love you for giving them food and milk to eat and drink to keep them alive.

In conclusion those are the reasons why people should become Seagoing Cowboys. It would benefit you and those people who need food and water.
