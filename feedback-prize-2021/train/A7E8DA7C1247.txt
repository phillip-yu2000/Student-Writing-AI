The school should change the sport and other activities grade average to B because many students have C average, which is not acceptable. They have to try hard to get a B average than a C average because you can get a C average just by doing 70% of work. If a student fails on a big test and they have a C average, their grade will go down to a D or F which will make them unable to play sports causing their parents to get mad at the school because they think that the school doesn't care about their child's education.

The school grade average can get higher if you change the average to B because many kids want to play sports or do other activities and having a good school average will help the school passes levy and even more parents will support the school. All parents want their kids to get their grade average to a B or an A. There will be more smart athletes that can get a scholarship if you just change the grade average. Anyone can get a B average by just trying a little bit harder. So please change the policy that all students should get a B average in order to play athlete sports or do other activities.
