Dear Principal,

I would just like to say that I think what you plan on doing to the sports and other activities isn't fair to students. Students should be able to participate in any sport or activities if they have a passing grade, and a C average is on that grade scale. Most people who are in sports these days don't have a B average, they have a C average.

And if you close it off for any students that have lower than a B average you would losing most of your players. Unless it's your goal, to lose all of the schools sports players and activities participator's. And I don't think it is, or I hope it's not.

This school is based off of the sports teams and the grades, but without a sports team the school would go down in education. Not only will students stop trying to get good grades but there parents would start getting mad about their kids not being able to participate in any sports or activities. Yeah I mean if you want to mess up the school's education than that's up to you, but your only ruining things for the students and the school. And most students come to this school because of the sports teams.

So if you limit it for other people than those people would want to go to a different school, and trust me you would lose a bunch of people. And most people don't want to leave this school because they like it the way it is now and changing it wouldn't help make it a better place to learn. So all I'm really saying is that if you change the grade average to a B you would be losing a lot of things and students. I just hope that you see this letter as a guide for you to make the right decision and not make the wrong one when it comes time to decide. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
