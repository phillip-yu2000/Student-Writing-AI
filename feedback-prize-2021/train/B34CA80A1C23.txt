As a scientist at NASA I strongly believe that the "The Face on Mars" is simply a martian from of a mesa, which is commonly found on Cydonia. According to the text "There was no alien monument after all." This was of course after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) flew over Cydonia and captured a higher resolution image of "The Face." In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.

Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states "Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists." This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.

In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon "Mars martian face" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere. There was no need for all the chaos and random conspiracy theories, all it need was a little bit of science and hard work.
