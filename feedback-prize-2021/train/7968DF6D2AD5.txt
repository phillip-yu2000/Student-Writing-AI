dear TEACHER_NAME,

You should have all the students do community service. Because some of them could possibly change the world. If they try to do good work they might like it and keep on doing what they were doing. Also they could help others. Like poor people and people that have no homes, they could change their lives. And it could change their attitude. Maybe some of the students there are bullies well the community service could change the way they are. This is why students should have to do community service.

First of all they could change the world. Like maybe they could help make awareness of saving the earth. They could probably stop littering or something to change the earth. Also stop bullying. Like if some one sees some one bullying some one else then tell an adult. Don't sit there and watch them get bullied. And stop all of the crimes. keep our city safe. and clean. And watch out for bullies.

Next they could help others. like people with cancer. some could donate their hair. Or give a home to the home less. And maybe give the poor food. or money. help people with what they need. They could change some one else's life. there are a lot of good people out there that need our help so why not help them?

Lastly their attitudes could change. Like their heart could change the way they feel about other people. maybe working together would stop the bullying too. but nothing could change the heart like being with other people just like you.

That's why we all should have to do community service. because some of us could change the world. And help others with what they need. Also change our atti
