Dear principal,

I think we should have phones in school because they might have calculators and that could be one less thing we had to buy for school. then maybe at lunch you have to tell your parent that they forgot your lunch at home so they have to bring it to school for you. You may think why don't you just eat the school lunch maybe your a vegan or a vegetarian. The school may offer alternatives for them but how many of those alternatives would you actually eat. or how many of those alternatives could you eat if you were vegan or vegetarian.

Maybe once in while you have an emergency and you need to call your parents right away to tell them something. or maybe they need to call you to tell you maybe a relative dies so you need to get out of school early and you might think why don't they just call the school maybe the parent is almost there and they need you to get ready right away or maybe your dad is injured so your mom needs to call you and let you know that you need to go to the hospital. then maybe you left something at your friends house and he told you that they have it in there locker and you need it for that class and you need to tell them to get it.
