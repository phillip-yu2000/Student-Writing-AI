Some say that the face found on the surface of Mars is just that, a face. But others would say that the Face is only a mesa with shadows that cause it to appear as though a face were there. But who is correct? I honestly do not believe in aliens so I would have to say that the latter of people are the ones who have their stories straight.

The first pictures of the Face went to NASA in 1976. Most everyone was convinced that this Face was proof of aliens and martian life. Then another picture of the Face came in, in 1998. This picture showed a little bit more of how maybe, just maybe, this was not actually martian life. Then in 2001 when the final picture came in and showed everyone how this Face was simply a mesa.

But still people say that NASA warped this picture and that NASA wants us to no proof of alien life forms. But if NASA had proof of other life forms, they would get more sponsor ship and it would be better for them. NASA would want us to know without a shadow of a doubt that other life forms are out there. It truley would be beneficial for their company and for the future of their company. So, for people out there to say that NASA is lying to us and that the Face is real and that NASA does not want us to know, that is absurd. There is also a people group who would say that because there was a haze in that region of Mars the day that the 2001 picture was taken, that the picture did not capture the whole thing or the complete Face in all that it is. But I think that these people are simply grasping for straws.

There are many theories about the Face on Mars, but there is really no way to know who is correct. The only person who can truley know is God. People today can put stress on one tiny little happening and focus on that. Whether or not the Face is real is a pretty big question with a lot of answers but in the grand scheme of things, this small little detail dos not matter as much as some people seem to think that it does.
