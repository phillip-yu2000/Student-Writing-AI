Dear Principal,

I think the idea to change the policy so that students need at least a B average to participate in sports is not a good idea. For many students, a C average is the best they can do. Sometimes the students who participate in sports have a hard time keeping even a C average in their classes, but they are amazing on the field or in the gym. I don't think you should take the one thing in school they're good at and enjoy doing away from them.

I also think you should keep the policy at C average so that it gives more students opportunities.

Some students may think they can't maintain a B average and decide not to try a new activity simply because they fear being kicked off of a team. The majority of students have a C average, anyway. So by changing the policy you could possibly create more discrimination between student groups.

In conclusion, I do not think the policy should be changed. The way I see it, there are too many possible bad outcomes. I hope you will consider my opinions when you make your final decision.

Your student, STUDENT_NAME
