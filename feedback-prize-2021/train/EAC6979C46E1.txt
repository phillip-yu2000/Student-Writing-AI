Have you ever thought about the future? As a day gose by we have to start think about what will today be in 10 years from now. i can picture my self getting into a car that has automatic opeing doors and the car driving it self. We are living in a society where new thing are being made every day, just like the new cool hoverbored.

There are many pros to the new invention people are coming out with. Several of the ones i have herd are about how they will make life a lot easier. For example look at the new hover bored, a flat surface that can move right left back forward yes this make life easier but it also effects us. You could be walking places that will give you good extercise.

When you take a look at car driving themselfs that is kinda scary though. just imagen what could happen if the car took a wrong turn and there was a big trailer coming that could be your last day alive. We see on televison and movies that have long been fascinted with cas that could drive themselves but that is all but in reality that is all fanticy made by a computer. this world has taken it a step to far on how we are just being here for nothing why dont we just have computer do everything. Because that is what it looks like.

In conclusion I feel that this is a very hard topic to arrgue about beuase yes I would like to make life easier but at the same time I want it to be safe. I feel like we should be take life nice and slow and more car driving on there own for a bit firther in the future.
