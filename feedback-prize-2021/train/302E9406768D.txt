Hello there, I'm Luke Bomberger, I was asked to recuild new members. I believe if your part of the Seagoing Cowboys you'll have the time of your life, come on now just take a look at me.

I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and Pacific Ocean twice before.

If you do not believe that you will have the time of your life then you will not believe all the beautful places or imagtheant. You may not want to come because you do not believe in what I say to be true. "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelivable opptuntiy for a small-town boy", like myself.

The fun bit is when you get to take care of the animals or when the animals had been unloaded and the space where the animals used to be are free, you can go there, and play games like baseball,volleyball, table-tennis, fancing, and boxing or read a good, nice (or not so nice)

books.

I rember that when I was a young boy, I used to work at my aunt's farm. I'm a hardworking person, that is not really used to the sea during my second trip. The effect that was caused me not being use to the sea was I had a job as a night watchman, I had to check on the animals every hour. Then one day I was doing my daily rottone when a storm hit and I lose my blance, I'm lucky that I'm okay thought.

At the end of my adventures I realise that I have learned so much about others and their ways of life. Thanks to Seagoing Cowboys I have done many good deeds,

and my family host a number of international students and exchange visitors for some years and I do hope for many more to come. Thank you all for coming to the the indorceiner of the Seagoing Cowboys program!
