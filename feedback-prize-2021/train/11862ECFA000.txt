I am writing about the decision of community service. I take part in helping out my community by cleaning litter and helping out with my church.

And sometimes i help people who can't do things on their own. I think everyone should take part in community service. It is very nice for people to do so.

I think community service is a great idea. I am for every one having to do community service. I think it is a great idea because it will teach people character. I think that we should all take part in cleaning up litter to protect our earth and keep it safe for our future kids. I try to convince people to do community service to help others out when in need.

Also i do community service for my church. it makes me feel better about myself. Doing community service isn't just because people want me to do it, It's because i like to do it and i love helping people out. What i do to help my community out is usually pick up litter and help people who can't do things for themselves. I am always up for community service. I love to help people out not matter what. I will help any one at anytime.

I think every one should help out in the community because it brings us all together into one big family. It also helps to clean up our environment. Everyone has enough time to help perform some type of community service. Even if its just for a half hour. I try to convince my friends also to do community service. Sometimes they do but sometimes they don't. No one is ever to busy to not have time to help out their community.

this story is very enjoyable to write about. I think community service is needed to be performed by ever person who lives in that certain community. I do community service to and this is how the story relates to me. I feel very strongly about this topic and what i wrote.
