I think that video conferencing is great because the students will be able to get notes if they're sick or injured. The video conference is good for a couple of reasons: 1.) So sick students can attend class without getting anyone else sick, 2.) If the student is on a trip somewhere and needs his/her work so they won't fail, 3.) If the student has an injury that causes them not to be able to go places or do certain things. Those will be the topics that I will be discussing in my essay.

The first reason that I said was if the student is sick. If we couldn't use the video conference then some students will fall behind and this will cause them to fail. But if we use it then they can get caught up and they will know what they are going to be doing in class when they come back. Some students might even get ahead in the class if they do this.

My second reason is if the student went on a trip somewhere and needed to make up some work. They could video chat and get the work so they won't fail the class. This will help them succeed and push them to come to class. Like I said before they might get ahead in class and then get to relax and take a break.

My third and final reason is if the student has a injury that causes them to be unable to come to class. This is why we need this video conference so that students can get there work if they are unable to get it and learn it the correct way. I know if I get makeup work from a teacher it's going to be hard because i didn't learn any of it because I was absent for the lesson.

THose are all the reasons why we should have video conferences. We have them to help out the students who are sick, injured, or failing. There is nothing wrong with video chats, they help us with our work so we can get it done and won't have to worry about it any more.
