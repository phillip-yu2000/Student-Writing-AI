Dear Principal,

I heard that u were considering 2 new phone policies. I just wanted to give you my opinion on what policy you should consider. My opinion is to go with policy 1, because I think that students already have to go to school but they also should get to message or call friends or family about something very important. Like that for example what if a student wants to call his/her parents to go to their friends house to study or just to hang out. then their parents go and pick them up and end up not picking them up after all, so the parents just drove to their school for nothing. That's why I think you should consider policy 1 so that same example won't happen. Here's another example what if a student has a dentist appointment but she doesn't know what it is at, but if she messages his/her parents to find out what time it is at so she can get all of her homework from all of their teachers. And i' m sure students will actually listen to this new phone policy. One thing you should also think about is what are the punishments are going to be. Hopefully you are not to hard on the punishments if u choose policy

1. Well hope you greatly consider policy 1, because I would think that most of the students would like it if you choose policy 1. Well hope you choose policy 1.

Sincerely'

STUDENT
