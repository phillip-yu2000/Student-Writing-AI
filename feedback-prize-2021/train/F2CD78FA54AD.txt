Dear Mr. Principal

I think that performing community service should be required because it will teach students that go to our school to be kind and giving back to the community will make them feel better. I also think it should be necessary because it will teach the students to be giving and it could change their personality in a positive way. I also think it would be good because some students might think it will be fun cleaning up, and you don't have to do it alone i am sure you would be able to do it with a friend. I am sure it will teach them something about giving and it will teach them a life lesson. I also am a believer in community service and i thing it is fun giving back to the community like that and afterwards i fell very happy and energetic about myself. So please take my letter into consideration and please make the right decision for our community.

Sincerely your student
