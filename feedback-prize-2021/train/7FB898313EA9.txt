I believe that the electoral college should be changed to a popular vote election. The current way of voting is electing the wrong canidate. The populrity way of voting is what the people want. It is less hoopes to jump through. Instead of having people that vote for the state why not just have the people vote then tally up which canidate has the most votes.

In the current way that we vote we decide how many votes a state gets toward the election. It is decided uponthe general population of the sate. This is just adding anoter sterp to the process that be could be much faster. Therehave been many elections were the popularity would hjave wone the election although the elctoral vote was greater therefore the wrong president won the election.

Inconclusion there are many more people like me that believe that there should be apopularity vote electin not based ofof the staes reps or whatever they call themselves. it is not the correct way and it needs changed now.
