In my opinion the use of Facisl Action Coding System is not valuable on a classroom because that is something dumb to do or have in a classroom.

A teacher can tell when a student is boring or when he is not paying attention the student might feel embarrased if he gets to take that test becuase, it will be in front of everyone, I think having that in a classroom will be useless but maybe for some students it will be cool getting their faces read by a computer program.

The story in paragraph 8 says "faces don't lie" and that is true we can fake a smile but not everyday, when we're tired we can't fake that we're not tired our eyes will be slow and we are not wide awake, when we're mad people easly notice it but what im trying to say is that having this technology to read the facial expressions of students in a classroom is really unessesary because our faces don't lie and it will be cool not going to lie but i don't really see the benefits of doing that, is worthless we wont be getting to know or learn from it but students will probably had fun with it and having fun is good in class beacause we get to take a break from school work.
