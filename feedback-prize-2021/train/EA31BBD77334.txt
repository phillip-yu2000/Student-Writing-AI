Do you think a problem should be looked at from one person or multiple people? I think problems should be looked at from multiple people because multiple opinions make better choices because it can be seen from multiple points of view, it could help you change the outcome and, it could help you make better choices in the future.

Seeing something from multiple points of view could help you make a better choice. It can help you make a better choice because other people might know more then you and that can help you if you are in a problem that other people can help with.

When multiple people say their opinion it can help you change the outcome. Lets say that you are in a problem and the outcome is bad, so other people say what they would do. You can change the outcome and you can change it into a better outcome.

When people give you advice in the future, it can help you make better choices in the future. Lets say that you just finished high school so you can mentor students that need help in high school. So you are giving the advice to other students that need help.

My conclusion for this is multiple opinions make better choices because it can be seen from multiple points of view, it could help you change the outcome and, it could help you make better choices in the future. So are you going to take advice from others and make a better choice?
