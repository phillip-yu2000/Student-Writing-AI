Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think community service is a great idea, but unfortunately other students think its a waste of time and will refuse to do it. On the other hand, others would like to volunteer and do the right thing. There should be a catch to this, for example: anyone that does 10 hours a month will get a pizza party with a movie. These kinds of things will persuade a person to want to volunteer.

At the end of the year, everyone who did more than 50 hours will go to Six Flags for all the effort they put in.

Everyone should get fun things to do like at a daycare center, teaching little kids to read, playing with the children that are in the hospital. Its not only good for our students, but to other people we are helping. Anything is possible if everyone gets involved to the something. With the good out of all of this, there will be less troubled people in this school. The people who help with feeding the home less will have a chance to talk to them and learn why they are homeless. It will make them realize that they want to do good in school so that they don't end up homeless.

Helping out with children will give girls a lesson on how hard it is to a raise a child and that its not a fun and games. Going to the hospital to visit the sick children is a good way to interact with people their own age. Community service is not just good to do, bit its also good for everyone to know more about life and the real world.

Sincerely
