You should join the UNRRA and be a 'seagoing cowboy'! Being on a cattle boat is an unbelievable opportunity. You get to visit different counteries and help people in need. It is also fun to take care of the different animals on board, like the cows, horses, and mules. I met many new friends while I was on the ship. There are many young men that joing every year, ready to make friends.

Like I said before, visiting different counteries is a new experince for many people. It's true! While I was on the ship,we visited Europe, China, Crete, and many other places. In Venice, Italy, we took a gondola ride though the streets of water. In Greece, we saw the Acropolis.

The animals would be a new experince for some of you. Horses are very gentel creatures. Cows can be crabby, but sweet. Hauling up the hay, oats, and water for the animals every day can be tiring, but it sure gives you muscles! If you are carfull, you can ride the horses around on deck, but only in calm seas!

The men are always so nice, and we have lots of fun together. We wittle and carve, box and fence, and sing songs. When the animals are unloaded, sometimes we play games in the empty stalls, like baseball and volleyball. We love talking about our family and sweethearts who are back on land.

Over all, I think that being a 'seagoing cowboy' would be a very good experence and many of you would find it very interesting. It is an unbelievable experince and taking care of the animals and people you meet is pretty cool. I hope you think about my offer and remember what I said about taking care of the animals, visiting new places, and meeting new people.
