Dear principle,

Hi I am STUDENT_NAME I agree with the choice that says we should be allowed to have our phones out in class during lunch and during free time. I think This because kids want to have their cell phones out any ways. We also have our cell phones out even if the rule isn't passed. Cell phones basically is what the world revolves around. Everybody and their mamas have a cell phone. This generation is all about technology.

I know that you are probably thinking that we are going to do things that we are not supposed to be doing, but we do it anyways so why not just let us do it in the open. I personally don't see why the rule says that we can't have them out it will benefit us also. I do understand why you wouldn't let us have them out because you think that we are going to have it out during class and stuff. Well why punish us all for what a couple of people who got caught did. Why not just take the privilege away from them and not everybody? This school I know can do it. We have been trustworthy school. Think you should take this letter into consideration and let us use our cell phones during lunch and free time. And hey if it isn't a push maybe you could consider us using them all day, but i doubt that. I think it will be a helpful thing plus useful and fun at the same time!

Love,

STUDENT_NAME
