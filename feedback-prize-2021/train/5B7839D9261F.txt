No, i think students wouldn't benefit from taking online classes at home because, taking from classes at home maybe good for people who have social issues, for some people they are more comfortable at home, and some people doing school at home might be easy for them to start a job.

I think classes are good for people who have really bad social issues to the point where they dont like talking in public or to new people, there are other options for that like sports or clubs or just spending time with family for the most part,and for people who have social issues shouldn't be rushed into a school with people because that could be terrifying for them could make them freak out so let them do school and slowly work on their social issues.

So, people sometimes arent comfortable at school but, if you did online classes where your by yourself or with family your more comfortable. Sometimes school can stress you out with test, classwork, participation, lack of sleep if you have a job while being at a public school, time, missing the bus if you ride one, its just the responsibilities that people have while in public school, if you did online school you could work at your own time and get it done, you might not have a teacher around but thats why you have an adult or someone that can help you.

For some people in high school mostly it hard to keep a job because, it's tiring, stressed out and even though you can tell them what days you work and the days you can't it's still hard going to school straight to work Because you can't be focused on one and ruin the other one, here to make it more clear if you have a job right after school and your grades are decent but sense your focused on your job more then school your going to start failing and thats really hard to do for some people but not a lot of them it might just be me but trying to good at multiple things is difficult but, if you did online classes it wouldnt be as bad you could have a full time job and do school at your own speed, it's good for young people to have jobs so when their ready to go out in the world to see what it's like they will be ready because, they'll have experience, then for people who didn't and they'll have a better chance of getting a job if you have experience then some with none.

Therefore, students wouldn't benefit from taking online classes, i think they would take the chance while they could and do online school with their own reasons, maybe not exactly like like but maybe similar to mine, like if i had a choice of doing online school I would most certainly take that chance while i could.
