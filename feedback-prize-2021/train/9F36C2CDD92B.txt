Dear principal,

Feb. 9, 2011

I think that the children should be able to bring their cell phones to school. why? because i think they should be able to call someone incase there is an emergency at school and the school phone is not available at times. When there is an emergency we, the kids, can just have out phones and call for help. I also agree with the thought of having them out at lunch periods. because you know that we like to socialize with our friends. We like to show them our Facebook and stuff like that. At other free times would be nice to have out. So i think that this idea would be nice to have and to keep. Also you would want your students to be happy at school and learning. It really gets me happy when i know that when we have free times ,that we can pull out our phones and be able to talk and have fun in that little amount of time. I'm sure that most of the students would agree with me. Most students would love this idea. To me it just makes sense to bring phones to school. If adults can have free time then why cain't the kids have free time as well. But that's just my opinion about this thing. Like i said moat students would agree with me on this. Just as long as the phones are not distracting to us while we are learning then there should be no problem why we cain't bring them to school. I think that the teachers might think that we might be txting during class and are not staying focused on the work. I think that is the major problem with the teachers. Well principal I think that this idea was a good one for us students. Nice job. See you later!

Your student,
