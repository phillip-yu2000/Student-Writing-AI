Dear Principle,

I have been informed that you are thinking about making the requirement to play sports a B

grade average. I think that this is a bad idea for many reasons. Most of the kids in this school only have a C grade average which means of the kids that might want to play sports this would not be good for them because that could mean that they cant play sports anymore and that could disappoint a lot of people and even some parents. If this happens it could mean people leaving the school and are school's sports teams might not be as good as they used to be because some of the good kids only had a C average and they could not play sports anymore. It would be in everybody's beset interest if we did not change the requirements. If and when you would change this policy it would be such a bad thing to the people who love to play sports. When parents find lout about this policy some of them could get really mad an d even make their kids go to a different school that is if the kid don't recommend changing schools first.

So I ask that you please don't change the policy it would greatly benefit your school and I think you would be happy with the outcome.

Sincerely,

Student
