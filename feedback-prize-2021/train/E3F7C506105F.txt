Sometimes, poeple can get into trouble or cause trouble, they usually end up seeking for advice, or help.

People would often times ask multiple people for advice on their situation. The reasoning behind this is because they are making sure they get the best advice for their situation, and then use this advice to fix it. Getting multiple awnsers can help you decide what to do and what not to do, on the other hand, if you only get one then there is only one possible way to fix it that may or may not be the right choice.

When asking multiple poeple they will often decide to help you with the problem. If they decide to ask one person they might not get any help at all, and then give up. People will choose to ask a group of people for more than one outcome, also because some ways to deal with something might be better than others.
