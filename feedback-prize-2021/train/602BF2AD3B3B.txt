Most students that are in sports try very hard to keep there grades up. Adding more work can cause the students to become stressed out and tired. We suggest that at least if we have a high C we should be able to participate in school activities, and even if we try are hardest to keep are grades up ,but it just doesn't we should get the change to participate, the main reason why most kids grades drop is because they don't get the right amount of sleep that they need to be ready for the next day .

Having a high C not really all that great, but it can help a lot of people when their not doing good and are about to fail. If a student has a high C and the marking period is almost over and their's nothing he/she can do about it they should be able to participate because that means that they really tried, but just not that hard to be able to pass. Grades are like money. the reason why i say this is because the way we spend money is the way we treat are grades. I think that having a high C means that the next marking period that he /she should pass with no problem.
