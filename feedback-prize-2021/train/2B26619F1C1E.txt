Online school has been a learning alternative for the past years, there are a few students who decided to take this option, due to different reasons, but most of the parents would rather have their kids studying in a regular school, where kids attend every day, and have a consistent work routine, with the same schedule on a daily basis.

School as a real thing is better for a person's social interaction with people, and the building of strong relationships with teachers, new friends, classmates, counselors, etc. All of these are essential for everybody's healthy formation. All kids should learn from all cultures around the world by being surrounded with other kids from different places and different cultural traditions and celebrations. Going to school should be an experience that everybody should live, so when they grow up they can have multiple memories to remember.

Students that take online courses and study from home can get all the attention from their tutor, due to the fact that they are the only person taking the class at the moment, they can also learn at their own pace, but sometimes this can bring negative effects for the student, because they could fall behind compared to the students in the same grade as them, by learning at a slow pace or getting distracted, losing focus is more likely to happen while being at home due to all the distractions that we have there, like televisions, cell phones, and all electronics; also, younger siblings talking in the back or family members doing home duties while the kid takes the class. While being at school the teacher has more control over the situation and they can keep the class organized because of the school's rules.

When kids don't go to school they are being held from participating in after-school programs, extracurricular activities and sports, which are always beneficial for an individual's learning and mindfulness, they also get to know new people and form strong bonds with teammates, coaches, instructors, guides, tutors, leaders, etc. Taking online classes can help their students to create their own schedules in case that they have activities to do at home that take long periods of time, for example gaming or streaming, which can take from six to nine hours a day for professional gamers who already make a living off of it, on the other hand, school starts at the same time everyday which is usually early in the morning, this way students have a free afternoon for themselves and do all the activities and duties that they have to complete, it even helps high school and college students work at their jobs if they have one.

Online school can bring benefits to a few students, even thogh it is not meant for everybody, there is people that don't have another option but to take it, and it is not wrong at all, it is just that a real school is always a better option if it is possible to attend, learning is important, which we could get from both types of schools, but, having manners, knowing your rights and freedoms, mental health, relationships, friendships culture diversity, and a good time management will always influence in a person's behavior, lifestyle, and personality.
