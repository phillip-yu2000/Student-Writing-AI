HI, I'm Luke, and i work for the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rahabilitation Administration. I am a Seagoing Cowboy, and my job is to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. On the ship you get to take care of the animals and sometimes play games. There is no better job than this! When you are a doctor you have to be extremely careful and have to watch people suffer, a construction worker has to work al day long, a cashier has to sit and wait for people to buy something, but here we help thousands of people and animals while having fun! I have no idea why anyone would out down a job like this! It doesn't even feel like work! You can learn so many good things and meet new people, you can see amazing structures and even explore them! One time I went into a broken down castle and found the coolest stuff. We have gone to the Panama Canal, Italy, and many more amaxing locations. There is Germany, France, and preety much any other awesome country there is! There isnothing else to say beside that being a Seagoing cowboy is the best job there is.
