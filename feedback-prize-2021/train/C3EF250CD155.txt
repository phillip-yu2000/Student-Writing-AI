Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think that we should be aloud to bring our cell phones to school because we have no reason to. What are we going to do with our phone? We can't even get on the internet to get on facebook. There is no clear reason why we need it. Other schools use their cell phones in class to do projects and look up things. You can't trust them to actually do their work. You might think they are, but they're probably texting or playing a game.

Another reason that we don't need to have our cell phones in school is because if you were texting, you would just get caught, and the person you were texting would get caught too. We let them off too easy. If they get there phone taken away the first time, they just get it back at then end of the day. They should pay a fee or get ISS if they get caught. But who are we going to text anyway? We all have school. It seems really stupid to keep your phone in your pocket all day, off.

One question you might ask is,"What are we going to do with it?" Well, what are you going to do with it? There is no point in bringing it to school if we can't use it during the day. We can't get on the internet, if there is no WI-FI. Then you have no use for it at all.

People everyday get their phone taken away because of texting or playing a game or even just having it on your desk. If you don't want to get your phone taken away, then don't play with it during class. It affects peoples learning when they don't pay attention to what the teacher is teaching because of them on their phone. We do not need to bring it to school under any circumstances. If they are a part of a sport or club after school and it gets cancelled, then they can go to the office to call home and tell their parents. They ha
