I think other people sould try help other cause they dont't have anything like ue so it unfair that they have nothing but we have all kind of things like food water after the wars some dont have home to stay in i think that we sould work together to help the homeless and the one who lost there house by war.

We sould have all the same stuff and thing as everyone else cause it ulike them to have food,water,etc,and more but we do so if they are differnet we are all the same and they sould be able to get things to it not fair that they all sould be happy as we are cause we are all human together we help each other like Luke and Don did to help that were in war and lost all there homes and their food and water.

So i think that we sould come together and help give food and other thing to the poor so they won't feel left out on all thing that are going on in America. they probly think that we are just having fun and they suffer though all kinds of thing like no real cholthes or shoes nothing and we have it all they probly are reallt skinny they can't wear anything but old cloth.

we sould put up a fundraiser and use the money to get them some new thing and work together and rebulid up their houses again os they will be safe and warm inside a home . sometime i feel like we are just need a break from all this technology and go back to books and learn things that are in our brains then when you learn how to care for other then you can go back to the way you are and e happy as will they if you are much about them.

Don and I think that they sould join a help suvice and help people who had war and lost everything they had to earn so we came and traveled every plac you can think of that had war and gave them food,water,and a home to stay at.
