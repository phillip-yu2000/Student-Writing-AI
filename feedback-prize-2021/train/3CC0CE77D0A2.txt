Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it is important to let children bring phones to school. After school, sometimes your parents will get in traffic and they are late to pick you up. In times like this you will have to call them and especially if its cold, you will not want to stand outside for that long. If you call your parent on the phone he or she can inform you that you need to go home with a friend or not depending on how late she will be.

When students are at lunch that is their only free time, well except for in the hallways, in my opinion I think students like me should be able to bring cell phones and talk to one another. At lunch time it's very nice that I can talk to my friends and if we had cell phones I could also talk to my family and even people from other schools. If you are in the hallways you should also be able to use your phone because you are not learning anything at that time. When teachers don't need your attention, we should be allowed to use those devices.

During class time, it is very important to have your phones off, I do agree with that statement. If ring tones go off, the whole class just laughs and gets disrupted. When this happens, the teacher has to write a note and send the student whose phone went off to the office. I wish that, that wouldn't happen so often.

Thank you very much for letting me enhance you with my opinion. I hope it will mean something and that you can change your policies. I am very happy I could help!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
