I think that the students should be able to be in sport or other activities with a C average to start with. If they show that they are committed to the activities then the grade level should go up to a B average. If the students have something to do that they really like they will put there all into it. If the activities starts to pick up then the standards should be higher for the school work and grades. If they really care about the activities then they will make sure there school work is good. So they can stay in the sport or activity they are in . If there grades go down they should be cut out of the sport or club they are in. Until they get there grades back up to at least a C average then up to a B average.

The students will like that because it will give them something to do after school. Instead of being at home bored. They can have a sport or club activity to give them the chance to meet new friends and to stay out of trouble. Maybe before they go to there sport or activity they can sit down and do there homework . So the teachers know that the students are getting there work done. If no one has home work then they can sit down and read for about 15 minutes. To let them know that school work is more important than anything. I Think that would be a good way to compromise the situation.
