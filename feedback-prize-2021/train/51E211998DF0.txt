Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Technology has grown a lot over the years. We now have computers, laptops, cell phones, and now even cell phones that are like having a mini computer in your pocket.

Cell phones are a strong advancement. Most middle school children have them, flip phones side kicks, I personally have an Iphone. My question to you is, why is it that if cell phones are such a big part of our lives we cant bring them to school? I know that you probably bring a cell phone to school, so why is it that we cant? I think that we should be allowed to bring our cell phones to school, but that's not to say that i think we should to be able to use them in class. Cell phones can be distracting at times, so I think that we should only be able to use them during lunch or even during our own free time. Why is it called free time if were not free to do what we want? What if there's an emergency at home or you need to take the bus home and you didn't know? You wouldn't have known. You wouldn't have known because you cant have a cell phone in school. As long as the phone is off during class it does no harm to you and no harm to me, which means that there is no reason why we shouldn't have them. With phones like mine which is broken i don't have a ringer or vibrate it does not make a single sound, I don't even know when I got a text, unless I check it. I leave you with this technology has grown a lot over the years, why cant technology in the schools do the same?

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
