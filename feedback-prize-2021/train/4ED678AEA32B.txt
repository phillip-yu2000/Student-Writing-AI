Many people dont get the chance to travel like a "Seagoing Cowboy" does. You can experience other cultures and customs ,as well as having fun in other countries. You could see monuments like the Eiffel Tower the ,Louvre ,or even the Great Wall of China. The fun of being able to taste other foods would be great. It would be awesome to travel all over the world like a "Seagoing Cowboy" does

Also helping out other countries makes me feel good about myself. You could also learn alot about cattle and farm animals aboard the ship on your way there. You could also play games when your not tending the animals ,(that might pass the time on the way back too). Also knowing that you could have saved many others lives with the cattle and other animals. Thats what i think anyway if i got the chance i would definitly be a "Seagoing Cowboy"
