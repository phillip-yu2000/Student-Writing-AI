Dear principal:

I don't agree to this policy change because not all students can be able to get a B or A on the report card. Sports is the only thing that we thing is fun from school. Is the thing that keep us from going back home early, take care of our annoying siblings or even going to a little kids party with the family. Their also the reason that a lot of students have their grades up and there's not that much fighting. Something important that they care about is their appearance to be honest, if theirs no cute football players nobody besides their family will attend, because girls don't want to see some ugly guy to be the quarter back that is representing us and our school.

Oh and there's another point sports represent our school, you don't want some wimps as the football players, because they will probably loose all the games and the school will be known as the wimpiest school in the whole district and I know me or any other students will want that at all, because if that happens like I said there will be fighting, really bad grades from the majority of all the students and the teachers will have to deal with us another whole hour teaching us something we should already know. Another thing that goes with that is that all the effort we have put in all these years will disappear and never come back, and sorry if I sound really disrespectful but is all true nothing of this is a lie.

Now if you are going to take out all the other curriculum activities just for us to have a B well your high level classes will be almost empty, because in my pre-ap math class all the students have a high C and even a low B but that is all. Also all humanities students have a high D or a C but no higher than that. And again principal it all depends in you not us.

But please dont
