I think the technology shouldn't be valuable to read the emotional of students in the classroom. their should be a different approch if we want to know the kids emotional status is.

Teachers should sit down one on one with thier students to see if something is wrong or is bothering them. There shoud be no need to have technology to see what is wrong with thier students. I can see if the technology could see are true emotion deep down inside. If it honestly can't then i see no reason to even have technology to read are "emotions."

I don't think its a bad idead at i think its very cool and neat how it works but i just dont think it would be all that if it wouldn't actually ready are real emotion at all. so thier is no need to even have the technology that they have now.

I think its alsome what this new technology is doing know but I don't think it work out to have this is any classroom or to help anybody. There is more help know for people to help them know how they are feeling or even to get there life togeather.
