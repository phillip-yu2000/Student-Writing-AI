Some people like boat trips. Some people don't like them. For the people who like boat trips you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

One reason to join this program is because you have so much fun! On my first trip I thought the cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for me. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was really special. Also taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

Another reason why you should join this program is because you get a chance to help people. The Seagoing Cowboys is about helping people with what they need. I went just after World War ll ended. A lot of small towns and cities were ruined from the war and needed help on getting their farming equipment. We were on a cattle-boat that had about 335 horses plus oats and hay to feed them. We had a lot more animals on our ship.

Some of the bad things about joining this program is the hard work and danger. The animals had to be fed and watered two or three times a day at least. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship and stalls had to be cleaned. But the worst part about joining this program is the danger. When I joined this program I cracked a couple of ribs. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, when I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. I was happy to be alive, but I could not work for a couple of days.

No madder if you like boat trips or not you should join this program. Don't think about yourself. Just remember, the best thing about this trip is that you will always be happy when you think about all the lives you saved and helped by joining the Seagoing Cowboys!
