Have you ever wondered if this "Face on Mars" was created by aliens? Well, I am sorry to dissapoint you however, because it was, in fact, not created by aliens. There is much evidence to support that it was not created by aliens.

To assume simply because a rock formation looks like a face that it is an alien artifact is illogical. Martian mesa's are infact very common where the Face of Mars was discovered. It just happened that one of them happened to have weird shadows that made it appear to be a face.

In 1976, the quality of the cameras that took the first photo of the Face of Mars on the Viking 1 were inadequate. On the Viking 1 photo, every pixel was 43 meters, meaning the photo would be very distorted. In 1998, it was taken again with a better, yet still not great, camera that would reveal the rock formation merely only looks like a face because of the weird shadow. In 2001, the photo was taken by a MGS with a good quality camera. The camera on this MGS had quality of 1.56 meters per pixel. Meaning if there were structures or a Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see it. This proves that the rock formation was not created by aliens.

The martian mesa is very common in the region where the Face of Mars was found, yet Garvin says "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." He continues by saying "That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars." It can be proved that this is not an alien structure as, not only is it common in that region in mars, it is also common in Western America.

There is strong evidence that proves that this 'Face of Mars' is not an alien structure, and instead simply a very common martian mesa that just happened to have shadows that made it appear to be a egyptian face. An alien structure on mars would be interesting, but I'm afraid this Face of Mars is not what it first appeared to be.
