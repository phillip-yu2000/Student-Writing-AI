It gets frustrating when a you don't know whether your friend or family member is mad at you or just in a bad mood. Luckily there is way. Thomas Huang, professor from the Advanced Science at the University of Illinos,has invented a Facial Action Coding system that allows you to identify human emotions. Its a great way to stop all the confusion and know if someone is happy to see you. Although its a great tool for everyday life, it's not a great asset in a classrom. Using technology to read the emotional expression of studuents in a classroom is not valuable becausse we should focus on teaching valuable material and its lack of accuracy.

The classroom is simply meant to learn. Evidendently, there is no reason to know what your student is feeling and not feeling. "Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements..." Like all devices, this Facial Action Coding System can have manfuctions. Instead of wasting class time to try the Coding system, you should use that time to focus on learning new valuable material and focusing on school and nothing else.

However, it states to be able to calcuate emotions like math homework but sometimes we get calculations worng. "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." Facial Action Coding system seems to rate all of the Mona LIsa's emotions from what she feels the most to least. Clearly stating that the Coding system ranks all emotions from least to greater. Not specifing what a peson is feeling.

Futher more, the Facial Action Coding system is a great tool for everyday life, but not it's not useful in the classrom. Using this device will not only waste valuable time to teach but its also lacking accuracy.
