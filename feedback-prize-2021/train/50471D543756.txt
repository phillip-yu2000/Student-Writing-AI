Every theory needs to have proof, or else no one will want to believe the idea. Theorys though, are just ideas or thoughts people have. Its hard to link a day dream to scientific facts. The statement that the Face was created by aliens is nonsense. There are no facts to back the idea up. Aliens haven't even been proved to be real! People need to understand that the Face is just a mesa, a type of landform that be found on Earth aswell.

If the aliens were real, don't you think something would have changed by now? There is absolutley no sign of any life near the mesa; not even on the planet. If the aliens did exist then we should have noticed some sign. The statement that the Face is only a landform is clearly correct, unlike the idea that creatures formed it into Mars.

The statement that the Face is just a mesa has lots of proof to back it up. There are many sets of pictures, including the pictures from the original Viking itself. The Viking was the spaceship on Mars that helped capture the landform on camera. There are also pictures from recent explorations that further prove that the Face is just a landform.

I think one of the reasons people like to dream up conspiracys is because of the other ideas spread by celebritys. People like talk show hosts spread there ideas for large groups of people to hear, causing people to further think on those ideas. Plus the movie that was made about the Face doesn't help by mixing the facts up. If I were to give you one piece of advice it would be to stick to the facts. Late night dreams won't get you far in a lab or other place of scientific study. The Face is just a landform, nothing more, nothing less.
