RE: Classes online

Not bacause I take classes online many of the students will not be responsible and they miss many grades, They will even have not internet in online classes for be doing their own things at home for example, if i have online classes i would be distranted by my brother or other things and i feel that my online classes is not would not be good idea like i say that online class is not a good idea there are many distraction. also, if we have that problem I think that beging with teachers is the best idea cause they help us a lot in the amies.

The firs reason is not all student have the internet in the houses some students don't have the internet because their parents don't have too much money to but one or maybe because they don't have the tecnology. One friend told me that their parents think that the tecnology is bad for him because it is distraction and he needs to focus on his future. and if he dosen't take that class online he will fall that class. every parents think different.

Another reason because not all student are not responsibles. some student came to school but they don't do anything' but it the teacher letf them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will no care about the class, And they don't will take care about the class.

The conclusion is tha bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, anbd not all the students have it, they need to have their responsability the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not al the students like to have classes online because they know that they can't consentrate in their house bacause all the noise around.
