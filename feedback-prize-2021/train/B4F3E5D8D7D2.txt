people would say that teachers are the best way of showing students how to get a better understanding on subjects like math, science, etc. Every student is different because, not all students learn the same way. there is away to help every student complete and get a better understanding on every subject. It is the "Facial Action Coding System" that can read the students facial emotion.

When there is a student that is getting bord or upset when a teacher is giving a lesson. The teacher cant just stop what they are doing to see what the student is upset or bord about. If schools allow students to have this kind of technology this may allow students to get a better undersatanding in the lesson. If a student is not understanding the lesson they will most likely lower there eye brows and in towards each other. This shows they dont understand what is going on. This will allow the computer to see why the student is not understanding or bord about. Than the computer will see this and modify the lesson so that the student will understand what is going on.

if a students is learning math on there computer and they are having trouble understanding what they are doing. The computer will see that they need help and it will most likely pull up a easyer way to solve the problems.

Having a school that will allow students to use this kind of technology may end up making it easyer for the student to understand there classwork or even homework. So this will allow the students to get better grades and having better understanding on the subject later on in life.
