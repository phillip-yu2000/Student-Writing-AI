when asking for advice, they sometimes talk to more then one person. multiple opinions make you have a better choice because if you ask one person you don't know if the person advice might get work or not. that's why seeking multiple advises are good, for example asking a bunch of friends for advice can help you decide which one would work out for you you can also vote on which advice is better, but you don't want a bad advice and and if you think that the advice is bad then ask other people if that advice is good or that and if not then ask for advice and keep asking other people. Another example why seeking advice is a good thing is because multiple advice helps you decide what is for the better and not a bad thing if theres something bad about that advice ask someone else what they think about that advice. Lastly seeking for one example is bad because if you go along an advice and don't do so well after you won't want another person to give advice instead you ask multiple people and they tell you something different and you agree with it and you plan what would happened if you do this and that. One important thing about asking for advice ask advice to the people you trust not the other way because they might give you a bad advice and embarrass you and you don't want that. This are my reason why seeking multiple advice are good and what not to do. an example of asking for good advice is imagine I have to retake a test and I ask a bunch of friends what to do. some people are going to tell me to cheat and others are goingÂ others tell me to study I would think about each advice and see if I study would I pass and not get in trouble or cheat and if I get in trouble I have to take responsibility. This are all my reasons why I think seeking for multiple advises.
