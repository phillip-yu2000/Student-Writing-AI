Do you worry about being late to or missing class?

Long distance learning has the answer! Students will benefit from using long distance learning by going at their own pace, and staying on top of their work load. Students will also benefit from not having to drive on i95 and other major interstates and unpredictable weather. Students would not have to worry about missing classes or missing work or homework. Even if students are sick they could still catch up on class without much delay. One of the downsides to long distance learning is, if the student is distracted by social media, then there's no one to tell him to focus on his school work. By far the main advantage to long distance learning is being able to stay at your own pace because; if your a slow learner than you would not feel the rush to catch up with the class, or to beat the fastest person in your class. Also staying at your own pace means that you have more time to soak up information rather, than cramming a lot of information into your brain as possible and hope that it sticks. Also if your a fast learner, then you would not have to wait on the slower learners as much in long distance learning as you would in real life.

One other downside to long distance learning is if a student has a question on a problem or a work sheet it may become difficult for a student to contact the teacher. A possible solution to this is a message board between the students and teacher so one or more of the students has a question the students can get the answer they need. The students could also help their classmates through the message board and FaceTime, if one of the students has a question and the teacher can't be contacted.

The main advange to long distance learning is having the student going at thier own pace because everyone is different, everyone learns differently, some are fast learners, while others are slow learners.
