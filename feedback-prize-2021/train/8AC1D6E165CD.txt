Dear Principal, I believe in policy 2. Kids are irresponsible when it comes to cell phone use during school. They will be unfocused during class and have the option of cheating.

Policy 2 is best because with policy 1, students will disobey it. Policy 1 says that students can have their phones during free time like lunch and in between classes but at our school, the kids wont listen. For example, a kid has their phone out at lunch and is texting their friend. The lunch bell rings saying lunch is over and class will begin soon. Most likely will the kid continue texting during class then saying goodbye and texting their friend after school.

Say everyone listened to policy 1. Kids are focused in class and cell phones are put away. Everyone is following rules and not using their phone. Though, some kids who have had different classes then the other, sit together at lunch, because their friends. They have the option of texting one the answers to the test one of them already took. This would make the person use their cell phone during class. This would not only disobey the policy but cause the person to cheat. Instead of cheating, we should put cell phones away all together.

In the end, Policy 2 ends up being better then Policy 1 because instead of unfocused and cheating kids, Policy 2 will keep the phones away and at home instead of being out during school.
