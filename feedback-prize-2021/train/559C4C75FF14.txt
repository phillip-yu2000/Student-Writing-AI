Are driverless cars good for the future or the destruction of it? I believe that driverless cars are dangerous to human lives because of how technology can fail, How technology has no reguard, and how it can be hard to use.

The first reason why the driverless car is dangerous is because of how it can fail. If I am driving I sure don't want to have the technology to fail and cause me to kill a person. For example what if the car never told me that I had to start driving and it went through a construction site and killed some of the workers. There would be blood on my hands!

The second reason why the driverless car is not safe is because it has no reguard for any thing. It is not like a living human that cares about the surroundings and can think to change course if need be. It may not think that a baby passing on the road is a big enough concern to try and stop. It states this in the passage "most driving laws focus on keeping driver, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that saftey is best achieved with alert drivers. Which goes along with what i am conveying.

The third reason why the driverless car is not safe is because of how hard it is to use for some people. I bring this point up because the old people in our society should be served first. They can hardly use Windows 8. Trying to teach them how to use a car that is way more advanced than Windows 8, would be terrible. They would not be able to know when the car is driving and when they should be driving.

Those three reasons are why the driverless car is not safe. It might malfunction, It has no reguard, some people might not know how to use it.
