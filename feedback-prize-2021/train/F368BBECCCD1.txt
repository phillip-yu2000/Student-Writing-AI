Imagine you are a Highschool student struggling to keep up with the work in all of your classes, with online school you can work at your own pace and be able to get better grades or maybe you have a job that requires you to be there during part of a school day. Those are just some of the many reasons I believe how students can benefit from online school.

Some people believe that kids do not benefit from online school, for example, the kids can't get actual help from a teacher who is normally present during regular school. This is important because some kids learn differelntly than others and may need that extra help from a teacher but some online courses may not have that option.

Online school can be very beneficial for students in high school and college students who have jobs to where they cant attend school for a full day, for instance, I have a friend who gets paid to play video games and so he does his school online and he can complete it at his conveinience and still get a degree. This is important because it gives the student a chance to learn and be able to accomplish other things at the same time.

Students who have a difficult time keeping up with the work in the classroom can also benefit from online school because they can complete the tasks at their own pace, for example, I have a hard time keeping up with the pace of my math class and believe that if I were to be able to learn the material at my own pace I would be doing a lot better in that class. This is the case for most students in highschool, they have a class that they are stuggling to keep up with and because of it they aren't doing as well as they could.

In conclusion, for the reasons listed above, I believe that students can benefit from being able to attend classes from home, school can be difficult, especially when there are other things going on in your life.
