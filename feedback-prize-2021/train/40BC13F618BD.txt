Do you have a passion for helping people and visiting many places? You can express that passion when you join the Seagoing Cowboys. The UNRRA hired us to do one job. We are to take care of animals oversea. Of course these are orders.

This a wonderful job, an opportunity of a lifetime. Taking care of animals and visiting many places in the world is amazing. Seagoing Cowboys also get to help out people in need. Of course not all missions of ours is going to be easy, but that's ok. Just trust in your teammates.

I am Luke, one of the many Seagoing Cowboys. By 1947 I had made 9 trips, I feel like I have accomplished many important missions. During these missions I got to do some sight seeing. Seeing unique places like Europe and China. Aside from doing good deeds for people, it feels good to have some goals. Join if you like to have much more than an adventure. This program many even open up a new world for you.
