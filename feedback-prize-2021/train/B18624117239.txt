Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Cell phones are an important thing in today's world.

Most people have one.

While cell phones can be distracting, they are also very helpful.

Since you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy, I believe that the best possible policy is Policy 1.

Students should be able to have their cell phones in their free time at school.

Students sometimes need to be in contact with someone over something important.

They also could desire talking to their friends with their cell phones.

They could even if bored, just play games on their phone.

Those are some examples why cell phones should be aloud in free time at school.

Cell phones can be a bad thing at schools though, because they can get very distracting.

Recently, there have been many accidents due to people being distracted by cell phones.

Some examples of these accidents are people walking into things and many car accidents, all caused from someone being distracted by a cell phone.

It is even said that when a driver is distracted by a cell phone, it is worse the driving under the influence.

While cell phones are good, they can be very distracting.

If cell phones are used properly and at the proper times while at school, they should be fine.

If a student is caught using their cell phone in class, their teacher could just take it up for the rest of the class.

The only reason a student should be allowed to use it during class is in an emergency.

Otherwise, using a cell phone in class would be unacceptable.

Though cell phones can be bad, I still believe that they are more good than they are bad.

It is important to keep in touch with people.

If you don't see a friend at school, you could call them and meet up at lunch.

Policy 1 would be the best policy, and the more popular out of the two.

From Your Student,
