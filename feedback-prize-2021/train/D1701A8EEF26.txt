Dear Mrs. Principal,

Would you please consider to let students play sports unless they are failing two classes? many of my fellow class mates will feel very strongly against your decision if you do not at least consider what I am about to say.

First, most of the students at this school have a C average. Next, if only students with a B average can participate in sports, many students with a C- average would feel discouraged and give up before even trying. Some people in Algebra 1 have a c+ average because the work is substantially harder than Algebra A. Also since most of the students in the school have C averages than there wouldn't be that many people to try out for sports teams. Most of the students who have an A-B average are not very good at sports and therefore they don't even try out for sports teams. If they did try out than your team will mostly consist of scrubs. If there are only scrubs on your team than schools like SCHOOL_NAME and SCHOOL_NAME would murder them, and you wouldn't get any more trophies for the rest of the year.

Since most of the students have C averages, they wouldn't get put on the team, and thus they probably wouldn't make their high school team because over the Summer they would have had to start all over in their training because their muscles have forgotten how to play the sport like: swimming, basketball, baseball, and etc you have to continually practice in order to get better at it and in some states you can't practice them all year round so the only time they get to play them is for their school teams.
