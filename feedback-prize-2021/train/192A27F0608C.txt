Dear principal,

I think that letting students use there cell phones during lunch and free time is a good idea because i know that there are some moms like to text there kids well at school and also I don't think it is going to hurt the students or any thing. The rule just needs to stay in forced buy the teachers that when in class no cell phones are allowed or they will take them. cell phones are becoming more and more popular and kids are going to use them now matter what so why not just let them have some freedom with them. Kids are going to just keep hating school more if they cant do i little bit of what they want to do and if using there cell phone during lunch or free time helps them refocus than they should be allowed to use cell phones during those times.
