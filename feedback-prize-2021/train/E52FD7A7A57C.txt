Join in the Seagoing Cowboys program! We help countries recover thier food supplies and take care of horses, young cows, also mules that are shipped to us over seas. It will be a wonderful opportunity for small town boys (Luke's words). 44 nations joined together to form this group UNRRA (the united states Relief and Rehabilitation). And they hired us to help them.

It will be an adventure to travel all over the world helping people and animals (also Luke's words). We have alot of fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Besides the benefit of helping people we travel the world we go to different countries with friends that soon become family on this adventure.

We play games such as baseball, volleyball, boxing, fencing reading, whitteling and more! Once you join you will realize all of the good things you have done for people animals that are in need of our assistance. this job requirs alot of work and we keep you busy! But most importantly it is a job to help animals and people in needs.
