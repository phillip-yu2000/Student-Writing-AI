Protest

I would all the students that love doing sports to join the protest or the boycott with me and see what we can get out of it but sometimes it probably because of the money like the schools don't have enough money and they need more money because there a lot of kids going out for sports and they have Fs and but they still have the money to join the sport in there on the sports team for the whole season and they have all Fs and your coach don't know about it they are a really good player what would the coach do that's how I look at things but there not good and not going to practice they wasted there parents money then your parents would get really mad at you and sign you up for any sports anymore.

But if your really good and you make good grades you belong on the team but you can't make the practices that's showing the coach you don't want to get better and that's really bad and if you just show up for the meets or games your not going to face because you cant go to practice that's on you and your about to get kick off the team your giving up and your saying that you quite because of the coaches.

But some coaches don't care and just kick you off the team and be like bye cause your wasting my times and your time.

I would not like that because what if your whole entire school is really good at sports and there best in state for any sports and people that are the best they cant play because of there grades is what keeping them back so they would have to work on there grades and they have to ask there parents for extra help ay for more classes for they can be on the team they want and have a good season but its always school before sports because you have to make the grades and you will succeed on what your target is at school
