Dear principal,

Policy 1 is better because that way students will be allowed to bring cell phones but will have to focus in class. Then they should be used in lunch breaks so they can take a break from class work. Also its best if they are allowed to bring to school because there can be emergencies and students can call home. Policy 1 is also better because during class time they can be learning and working but when its time for lunch they can use it that way it doesn't have to be only work. They can also have time to call home during break for something they need. Policy number one is also better because only during class it has to be off so they can focus on their work but later on when it is break they can choose to use it. The only time it can be off is during class but that's all, and when it is not class time their cell phones can be on and they will be able to use them without any problem because during class they will turn it off. So policy 1 is really best to use because during class they need to concentrate and do their best and for doing their work they get to use their cell phone after. Policy 2 is not better because students will bring their cell phones because they might need it to call their parents after school or something. So policy 1 is better and easier for students to follow. That way there wont be any problems on whether for students to bring their cell phones or not to school.
