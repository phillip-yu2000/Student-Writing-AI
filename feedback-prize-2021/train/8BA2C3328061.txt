People need to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You will have lots of fun, see many of different places, and become aware of countries in need. Helping take care of the animals will be one of your jobs.

Taking care of the animals is pretty simple. They need to be fed (bales of hay and bags of oats are hauled up from the lower holds), watered (two or three times a day), and the animal's stalls have to be cleaned. Another job is being a night watchman. It can be very dangerous.

Another reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you can have lots of fun. On the return trip, when all the animals are gone and the stalls are empty, cowboys play baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, and many other games. Table-tennis tournaments are also held.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is quite an adventure. Having a chance to help people in need, playing games, and taking care of animals. This is a once-in-a-lifetime offer to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Please join us today!
