"New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others." I believe that this software is very interesting because it detects your facial expressions through a screen and tries to understand your emotions. However, I do not think that we need this software in our schools for education purposes.

There are a few reasons in which I believe that these programs should not be installed on our school computers. The text claims that "the computer could modify a lesson, like a human instructor."

However, I find this hard to believe considering the software can not specifically determine what lessons or problems you do not understand. One for instance, if a student is supposedly confused or bored, he or she can ask the teacher for help. If we have a school computer that modifies and changes the lesson due to facial expressions, it might get in the way and misunderstand what we actually need help with or slow us down. Recieving specific help from teachers, to understand the certain steps that a student struggles with would be a better option in my opinion.

Secondly, we do not know how accurate this software is. The program could be very touchy; It could mix up confusion for anger. The student could be upset about a different topic or could simply have a certain resting face. The accuracy could have a lot to do with how this program would help us.

Lastly, Why spend a lot of money installing programs to hundreds of computers at our school when we can recieve help from our teachers?

Teachers are there to answer specific questions and a software that only detects your facial expressions and matches them to emotions can not do that. Installing these programs to our school computers will cost the school a lot of time and money without knowing for a fact that this software will actually be useful. Given these ideas, I do not think that it would be a very helpful addition to our students to install this software.
