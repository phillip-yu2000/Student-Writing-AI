Is the Face a natural landform or not? No one will ever know. Yes the Face in a natural landform. If you think that the Face was alien made than your wrong. This was not made by aliens it is a natural landform that has shadows that cause the lanndform to have such apperences as a nose, mouth, and ears.

The Face is just a landform because in the passage is says that with newer technology they would have been able to see other things on Mars. The passage says that the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The MSG had the best camera on it taking the best photos. Each of the pixels spans 1.56 meters compared to the 4 meters the best Viking photo that was ever taken.

After the first Viking photo was taken it instatly appeared on the JPL web site. When the photo appeared they noticed that is was just a natural landform and that there was no alien statue after all. In paraghraph three of the passage it states that "Although few scientist believed the Face was an alien articfact". That right there prove that the Face is not an alien articfact.

The Face is not an alien articfact. In the pasaage it states clearly in several different paragraphs that scientist dont believe that the Face is a alien articfact. Many people believe that the Face is just a natural landform. The eyes, mouth, and nose are all thought to be caused by shadows.
