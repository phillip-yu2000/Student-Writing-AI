Dear principle

I understand that you would like to change the grade policy from

C average to a B average for playing sports. I think this is a bad idea. we should have the limit be a C average because, not all students can foucuce as good as others, some students already know that they want to play sports for a living, and some students cant do everything at school.

Not all students can foucuce as good as others. some students have very short attention spans. some students are really good at paying attention wile others may have something holding them back. When students have a lot on their mind, something bad has happened, or they have a disabilities that is making it so they cant fouscus that causes them so miss stuff in school so they don't quite know every thing.

some students already know that they want to play sports for a living

Some students already know that they want to play sports for a living. School is suppose to help you decide what you what to do as a career. If a student already knows what they want to do then having elective classes are completely pointless. Students should be able to decide if they want electives.

Some students cant do everything at school. Some students may have ADHD or ADD with causes them to have a short attention span or not be able to focus and or pay attention.

Other students may have a lot on their mind such as the death of a loved one or fights with friends. This may cause them to be distracted and not focus so they cant work.

so again I understand that you would like to change the grade policy from a C average to a B average. I think this is a bad idea. we should have the limit be a C average because, not all students can focus as good as others, some students already know that they want to play sports for a living, and some students cant do everything at school.
