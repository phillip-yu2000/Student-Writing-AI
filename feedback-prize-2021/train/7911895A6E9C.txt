Dear Florida state senator, I highly suggest we keep the Electoral College for many reasons, I believe to be the most valued being, with Electoral College, we can insure the certaintyÂ  and fariness of the outcome. Majority of states award electoral votes with a winner takes all, type of deal. For instance, when no candidate has majority of vote, it becomes a bit of a hectic presidential election, but by using Electoral College, the result is a clear winner. Also, it is insured that there is no region that has enough electoral votes to elect a president alone. Which is great! If a candidate was elligable to be elected by a single regions appeal, that president is extreamly unlikely to be a successful president.

Many people believe that Electoral college is unfair, they claim that the candidates feel they dont have to spend much time in the states that they feel they have no chance of winning in, but in reality, instead of avoid the states the candidates feel they wont get votes from, they should probably campaign there, and try to win some votes. It's about making the people like you, making them want to vote for you, not feel avoided by you, and if the candidates still dont see it that way, Electoral College has solved this problem by incorpurating "Swing States." Voters in these toss-up states listen extermely closely to the competing candidates. These voting are often the most thoughtful because they know they are going to be the deciding factor in the election.

Becuase no region of voters can decide the election, and there is even a deciding factor of thoughful people who are listening cloesly to the election, Electoral College becomes not only the fairest, but also the most succuessfull way to elect a president.
