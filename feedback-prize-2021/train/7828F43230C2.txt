Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly disagree with your new school policy on having a B average grade to participate in sports and after school activities. I disagree with you because many of my peers and friends at this school have a C average grade. I think this is unfair because my friends work very hard in school and try to their best abilities. I know this while you may not. Another reason I disagree is because there will not be enough students to participate in these activities or sports if too many people have a C average. If not enough people participate, the sports or activities will be forced to be shut down. This would make it unfair for the students who have a B or higher average grade because now they can not do what they love to do. The last reason i disagree is because students who can not participate in sports will stop trying in school because they may think sports are their life. Sometimes, my peers only try in school so they can participate in sports and activities. This new policy should be eliminated.

A better policy for requirements to participate in sports is to maintain and 2.5 GPA. This is more reasonable because it gives students the chance to get a few C' s along with some B' s and A' s. Also, I think this will help the students increase their grades because they then know they aren't pressured into getting all A' s or B' s to participate in a sport or after school activity. Hopefully you will choose this option for your new policy.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you now understand why your new policy would make things unfair for all students, the good, and bad. I think the policy I gave would fit much better for our school policy on requirements to participate in a sport or a activity

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME (Student)
