Driverless cars used to seem like an impossible idea, but now these dreams are bcoming a reality. Driverless cars are an innovative technology and should be developed because of how helpful they are.

In the article, it says that driverless cars are forseen to "use half the fuel of today's taxis." In a world where everyone is clamoring to find alternative fuel sources, driverless cars would help tremendously. Cutting back on using up nonrenewable resources would be both cost effective and environmentally friendly. Even though it may cost more money to develop these new cars, using less fuel is one easy way to make up for that cost.

Using autonomous cars takes out the factor of human error in driving. With driverless cars, there would be no such thing as drunk driving or texting and driving. You would not hear about devastating accidents because someone was distracted while driving.

While completely driverless cars are a close possibility, there will be large debate over their development and, fortunately, there is time for that. However, driverless cars are beneficial to the environment, cost effective, and even safer with the right technology and therefore should be both developed and used.
