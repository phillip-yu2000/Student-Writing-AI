"Hold on! Can we acually "calculate" emotions, like math homework? And how can a computer recongnize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel." This was a qustion asked in the article "Making Mona Lis Smile" by Nick D' Alto, well its true, a new technology called "Facial Action Coding System," enables computers to identify human emotions. What do people plan to do with this technology? You may be asking, well according to the article people would like to use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. I disagree with this, students will lose a lot of their privatcy becaues of this technology, there are a lot of students that would not want others to know how the are feeling. Next this could lead to more bullying in schools, becaues other students could make fun of them becaues of what their results are. The technology could fail, what if there is something wrong with the technology and it gives out the wrong result, and everyone can see what the result was. However this could be really helpful to someone like a mental therepist, they could use the technology to their adventege by being able to see how people are really feeling, but this tecnology would not be helpful in a classroom where all kids are doing is learning. In conclusion this technology should be used in places like in amental tharepist office, but not in a classroom where there is no need for it in there.
