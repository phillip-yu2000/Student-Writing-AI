Dear, Principal

If your trying to decide if your going to make students complete community service I think the answer is yes. I think this because everyone should serve in a part of helping the community and what better way of doing that than community service. I think students should pick up trash if they see it. This way our community can stay clean and we are helping the community.

We should make time so where we have time to do community and have extra time to do what we want. I think community service is also a good way too keep children out of trouble. By performing community service it helps them to do what's right and what's wrong. I think community service is also good for doing good deeds too.

I think if students do extra time of community service than they should get a type of reward in school like Extra credit in a class that they really need it in. If you do this then kids are getting good grades in school and helping there community at the same time.
