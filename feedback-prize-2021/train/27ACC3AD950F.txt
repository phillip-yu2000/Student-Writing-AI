Dear principle,

I do believe all students should be required to perform community service.

If everyone works together to clean the community, or help someone do something then this community would be a much better and cleaner place. It also build character. It teaches you that helping can be a good thing, and maybe people would help more.

If we helped do something, like tutoring, more kids wouldn't have to be held back. Plus, it would give them self confidence when answering questions in front of classes. They would feel better about themselves and get better grades.

The community could be a cleaner place if we all worked to together to clean it. It would give children a safer place to play, and a safer place for pets, such as dogs and cats. We could help keep garbage out of rivers, therefore not polluting our water. We only have so much water and when it's gone, or extremely polluted to the point that you cannot purify it what are you going to do then?

Once we run out of recourses they are gone and we can't get them back. We have to help save the community and maybe it will make a difference in the world. We need to keep land clean, first of all so it will look nice, and secondly because it will help people appreciate what we have and maybe will want to help out too.

It you don't require community service for school then at least make it for extra credit in certain classes, so those of the kids that would like to help the community can and get a little bit of an reward for it.

Helping the community is very important.

Sincerely,
