My thoughts on driverless cars are, i think they would be cool but they could also be dangerous.

Some things they could be nice for is it would be something new for everyone in the world. Some risks there are is if one would crash and you would have to pay for it not the company that made the car. Another thing is what if you turn it with the stearing weel and it doesnt work. Another risk is if you set the car up to go somewhere and it does something else. I think it would be really exspensive for a driveless car. Also i think there does need to be new laws if they start selling driveless cars because i feel like people would take advantage of it and maybe even use it in a negative way. I think if someone is in a driveless car going to a destination in they get in a crash and get injured it should be the companies fault because people dont know how to wrok them.
