People may think that they know everything, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Great kings and queens have fallen and been dethroned not by their people, but by themselves. They let power go to their head and stop asking advisers and mentors. People must never get overconfident. You should always ask multiple people for advise before making a decision because you get different points of view.

People have different opinions and views. People seek advise when they are confused and maybe even scared. These pieces of advice can change peoples decisions and thoughts. You can easily be over influenced by one persons opinion. Viewing a problem from multiple angles help you get a clear and easy answer.

If you were to buy a car, and you knew nothing about cars, who would you ask? Most people ask their parents and friends. You can get many outlooks from those people, but you still need a opinion for yourself, so you might research cars and prices. I think you should always have your own thoughts before going to others for help, so you don't get set in one view.

I have done things that were not smart in the sense that I didn't talk to anyone. People say you should only trust yourself, but people are not perfect and they have flaws. People buy things they don't need and won't use. I am guilty of this myself, so I can give no judgment. I know from experience that you need to put a lot of thought into choices even if they seem non important.

You should always ask multiple people for advise before making decision because you get different points of view. I have listed countless reasons and examples of why you should seek as much advise as possible before coming to a decision. It is still your choice, but I just gave you a little advise to help you succeed and not get taken advantage of in the future.
