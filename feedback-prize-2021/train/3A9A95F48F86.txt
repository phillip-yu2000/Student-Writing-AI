Dear principal,

I think that policy one is the best policy to choose. I think its the best because kids these days enjoy to be on their phone whether its talking or texting or maybe even playing some games. I also think that it is best to use them during free time or during lunch periods because if we use them in class we will become unfocused and get bad grades and not do the work that was assigned to us because we were to busy on our phones talking to other people. Kids entertain themselves with their phones. I think that policy one is best for the kids. So they shouldn't be able to complain about this policy because they have enough time in lunch periods to talk or text. Plus they get more than enough free time in our classes. I also think that policy one is the best because what if one the kids have to use their phone because they are hurt or have something private like if they got dirty or that they got sick, they have to tell their parents while they are in school. But if policy two that's not going to be able to happen and the kids will be mad.

Sincerely, from one of your students
