I think it is important to help clean up the community. I believe that every one should help out. I think that every one should do their part. But you have to face the facts, most who people say that they don't have enough time, just don't want to do the work. You can help them by saying that you don't have to go all out on helping the community, but just do a little each day can help a lot with little effort.

I think you shouldn't force people to be good people by helping out the community. You need to persuade people to do it. You need to ask people to do it nicely. More people will help out if you ask and not command them to do it. If it is required people will protest against it for an act of freedom. If that happens then some people who do want to help out will help protest, because they only want to help out because they want to do and not you telling them to. That is all I have to say on this topic.
