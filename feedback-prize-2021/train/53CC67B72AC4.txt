extracurricular activesÂ are great it's a really good way to meet new people and even take a break from stressing about drama school it self and other things that might be stressful in your life. I would love to participate in sports but to be specific tracks because running makes me happy and I have meet a lot of nice people doing tracks and even outside of school when we go to track meets, it's was a great way for me to meet people that are now some of my best friends . Not everyone likes sports a lot of students might be good at taking pictures ,they can help with the year book and that's a good way to learn more about pictures and the skills and even what you can improve on. If your a person that loves school and care about it a lot you can the serve on the students council it's a really nice job, you get to help your school out and you might even get an award for taking the time out your day to help your school for instants the liberty you would help with the books or when we have things like the

Can Food Drive where you take food for kids in need.

Being involve more also help mental heath,being around people outside more instead of inside all the time doing nothing but on your phone or just eating. Also it's a great way to keep your grades up because if your in a activity you enjoy and your grades are falling you are going to want to work harder so your grades can stay up and you can remain in that activity. And the fun part is you get to meet new people that are into the same things as you so that's a win win. It's normally if you have a B or a A you can go on trips with the people in the activity you picked so you would be having good grades all the time.

I agree because it's a great way to keep your grades up, meet new people and also give you a good image if you are nice and not disrespectful. You can even get into a collage if you do join a activiy so why no just do it.
