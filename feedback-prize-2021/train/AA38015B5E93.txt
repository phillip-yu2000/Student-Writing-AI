My fellow citizens of America, we are in a crisis where pollution is at an all time high. We need to find a way to limit the amount of pollution given into our atmosphere. And I have found that solution. If we can reduce the usage of automobiles and form car-free communities pollution rates will drop to rock bottom in a matter of time. Germany and France are leading the way to limiting the usage of cars.

In Germany the town of Vauban street parking, driveways, and garages are strictly forbidden in the experimental district. You may own a car but you have to park it in a large parking garages and pay 40,000 for a space. In result to this change 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car to move there. Due to these actions the United States Enviormental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities. These are facts that we are taking a step forward in reducing the usage cars in everday life

Paris is very well known for the smog because of its consistant use of automobiles,therefore they have banned the usage of auto mobiles to clear the air of the smog
