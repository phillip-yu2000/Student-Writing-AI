Based on the passage, I can infer that the author studied a lot about Venus. He states that Venus is close to earth but close to the sun also. Which creates the problem that no human being can land on Venus because of its heat and density. Also in the passage, the author states how it's been three decades and we still, despite the technology we have, can't land on Venus. Not even the machine they sent out could survive. Problems like that make NASA more curious, which makes it more worthy of a pursuit.

The author stated that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet. Venus has a roughly 97 percent thick carbon dioxide atmosphere according to the author. Astronomers believe that Venus may have been a Earth-like planet long ago. The author says that Venus still has features that are similar to Earth features. Nasa has been working on a way to get humans to venus while making sure they survive and make it back. According to the author in paragraph 5, Nasa is trying to make a hovering vehicle for the humans to float in. It will have the capability to float 30 miles in the air. The only problem is that the astronaut wouldn't be able to get an in depth look at all the features because of the height.

The author states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. That can lead to a breakthrough idea to get a human to Venus. No ideas have worked yet but they're constantly working and testing out new ideas. The author talks about how human curiosity will lead to lots of intimidating endeavors and also lots of dangers. That alone proves how well the author supported the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
