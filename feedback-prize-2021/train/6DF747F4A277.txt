Some schools offer students to attend classes from home by being online. Therefore, students would be able to still learn while at home. Some people think that this offer does not benefit students. However, I think that this helps the students for many reasons. This offer can help with sick days, students who don't like to attend school, and less makeup work for students.

Students miss work and new lessons while at home sick. They can be out of school for a long period of time depending on their type of illness. Taking classes online or video conferencing can help them keep up with their work while out sick. If some schools do not have classes online for sick students they will most likely fail their classes if not caught up. This can benefit students while being sick at home.

Some students don't like to leave their house to attend school every week. They think it is a waste of time to wake up every morning to go to school. Online classes can help students with their hate towards going to school. To some students, going to school is tiring and stressful to do in the mornings. With online classes they can wake up at anytime to do their lessons with enough rest.

There can be students dealing with different situations at home. It can be anything in their life that causes them to not attend school on a regular basis. Addictionally, they would have a lot of makeup work to do for missing days. So therefore, if students don't have online classes they will have loads of makeup work to do. Makeup work can be stressful to do when the work is hard to understand.

All schools should provide an option to do online classes. Some people say this isn't a good option for students because they might not do their work. But it would be better because they get to choose what is best for them. This way everyone can be satisfied with doing their work.
