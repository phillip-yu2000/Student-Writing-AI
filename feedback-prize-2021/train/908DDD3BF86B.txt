I think driverless cars are not usuful right now and that they should not let people drive a driverless car on the streets, because a person still needs to be in the car and must remain alert in case he needs to take control of the car, driverless cars are not 100% safe, and it will cause a lot of confusion in case of accident.

Driverless cars are useless, because a person needs to be in car and must remain alert in case he needs to take control of the car, as the text says: "This means the human driver must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires",this does not make a huge difference between that and driving, also people would be very unconfortable and insecure about what could happen. Once i watched a video about a peron testing the autopilot mode on a Tesla, and most of the time he was insecure putting his hands on the wheel in case something happens.

They should not let people use driverless cars on the streets, becuase they are not 100% safe, driverless cars are safe in unreal sitions and in places without other cars, as the text says "They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents" this makes the car not safe. Also the car knows the streets and the buildings, but it does not know about others cars, or people that can intercept the car and that would not give enough time for the car to react.

Driverless cars are useless and they should not let poeple use them on the streets, because there would be a lot of confusion in case of accident, as the text says "If the technology fails and someone is infured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?" the laws are not ready for driverless cars, and in case of accident it would depend of a lot of factors to find out who was the responsable of the accident.

To sum up, driverless cars could be a very useful technology, but they have to inprove a lot more to be driven in the streets.
