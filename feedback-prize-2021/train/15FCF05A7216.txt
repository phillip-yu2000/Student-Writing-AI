In the article the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the risks and dangers. In paragraph 8 the author said " Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination ad innovation." Which he is stating no matter the risks we should travel so we can expanded to meet the edges of imagination.

But he didn't really support his idea until the last paragraph. All the other paragraphs are talking about how Venus is so inhospitable and how Venus has the hottest surface temperature in any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to the sun. The author also stated that "Venusian geology and wether prsent additional impediments like erupting volcanoes. powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes."

In conclusion the author didn't really support what his suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. All he talked about was how Venus is so inhospitable and how impossible it would be to get to send someone and get to the surface alive.
