Imagine on Earth the high for tuesday was 800 degrees. That is what venus is everyday. Venus is considered to be Earths sister. You can also call it the evening star. The real question though is is it worth it to go to venus?

The author in the article belives that it is worth it and we should go to Venus. What intrest the autor most is what could be on venus or what we could find. Venus could have vary may held Earth like creatures. It also could have been mostly oceans and has features like rocky sediment.

The reason we can not visit venus is it has a 97% atmosphere. Also the surface is almost 800 degrees fahrenheit. With that high temperature on its surface it can liquify basically anything. NASA has conducted a few missions to Venus but all have been unmanned for the reasons listed above.

NASA has been trying to come up with a solution for years so we can travel to Venus. What they have come up with is a blimp like aircraft that hovers over Venus. It is hovering over Venus by abouy 30 miles. A problem with that is it is still 170 degrees fehrenheit. Another problem is the atmosphere is 97% so the use of cameras and video are out of the picture. Another prototype they created was a machine made out of old computers which are silicon carbide. The prototype was put through a simulator and lasted 3 weeks.

In conclusion yes it would be risky to go to Venus but it is worth it. Could learn about what Venus' past life was like and was there really Earth like creatures. We could learn some similarities and differences between Venus and Earth. The main challenge we have to get past is 97% atmosphere and 800 degrees fehrenheit. NASA has created many prototypes that could lead us to Venus. I would say it is well worth it to go Venus and figure out what its past life was like.
