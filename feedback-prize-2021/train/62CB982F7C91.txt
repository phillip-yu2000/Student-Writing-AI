In this article i am against the value of using technology to read students emotinal expressions , because most people hate being reminded that they are mad. When looking at a person u can tell if they mad sad or really down , and for technology to do that there is no reason we should have a computer knowing were mad, happy ,or anger .

In article 5

for instance you can probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on there face as the article say. In this community today most people just look mean . As Dr. Huang perdicts most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional coummication . But wen using a fake smile the mouth is streteched sideways . Nobody should use a fake smile just to caculate that they are happy.

The value of using technology to read students shoudlnt be approve , most kids get bored but know alot , but just dont wont to do it most kids shouldnt be read if they dont wont to be read .
