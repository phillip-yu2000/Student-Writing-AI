To many peope it was confusing, but to me, it was life. Every night, I would come home exauhsted and tierd, but I knew I had to keep going in order to reach what I dreamed. Of course I put in a lot of labor, with barely any breaks, but if you think about it, its nothing compared to "the real deal" If you have a fear, at the end you will be over it and want to do that thing more often! When its over, it is something to be proud about and make sure that people know it! There is no reason not to talk about it and no reason not to brag, only because you worked so hard to get where you are now! If you want a chance to be able to say you did smething someone dreams of, its now!

This is a one in a life time chance, and if you miss it up, you wil regret it! In some peoples mind, they think that Seagoing isnt usefull, but they are wrong. People also think that all we have to do is work, but thats not true, sometimes we get a chance to look at the beutiful views and feature take, thats always a plesure! Going to Seagoing is much more than an adventure, it's a life time experience. You get to see different aspects and feature, it will blow your mind! You can never get enough of the people, animals, and views! You wil always want to make sure that you have a chance to talk and hang around because people have some pretty cool stories you would never get over!

If you want something to never stop loving, think about the views, people, and animals at Seagoing. It will take your breath away! Not only will you have a chance to relax, but you will have a chance to try new things. Like I always say, To many people it was confusing, but to me, it was life!
