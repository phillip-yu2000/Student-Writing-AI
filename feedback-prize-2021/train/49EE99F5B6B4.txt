Dear principal,

I think community service is a great way to help clean up the environment and that it would impact a great amount of influence on the students. If you were to require community service you would get more help, but really, it shouldn't be required. If it were to be required then some students would rebel against it or simply not do it.

Many students like to help and think it would do good for the environment and would be happy to do community service, but simply have no time for it. Some students are to busy with after school sports or clubs, and others would rather just spend time with there friends or stay home. Some students wouldn't even care if it was required or not and simply wont do it.

It still is a good idea to do community service, but students shouldn't have to do it. Instead they should be able to get extra points in school for helping out. Not only does it help their grade, but it would also let the students who don't want to do it know that they can find a way to pull their grade up some how.

Therefore, community service is great and all, but shouldn't be required. Instead it should be extra credit to those who need it or to those who simply want to help.
