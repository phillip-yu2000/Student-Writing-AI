I belive that the technology can be some what invaled because you cant excatly tell how a person thinks or feels because they could be sad on the inside but show a nuteral face on the outside or, they could be crying but while crying but crying tears of joy .How could a computer tell you the way that someone feels if they could feel a totaly diffrent way. A way a person looks on the outside may not be the way that they are feeling on the inside a computer is not a person it doesnt have emotions so how excatly could it telll what the emotions of another person or how they are feeling at the time . I dont belive that many people can tell the diffrence of a fake smile or a real smile so let alone how can a computer tell the diffrence between a fake or real smile because people think im happy alot. I usally fake my smile because i am sad on the inside but i look happy on the outside. With me saying that just by looking at a person can be deciving because you never know how the person excatly feels or what is going on in there head so therefore i belive that the facs can not tell a persons emotions.
