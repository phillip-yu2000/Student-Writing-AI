I am Sam ; the other NASA scientist is Robert

I am Sam Ulas and I think the "Face on Mars" is from natural landform. Because there are many peices of evidence to support my claim.

Here is one reason They have many different photos of the face they have hard to see photos from the bad quality and really good ones from good quality throught the years.

"Ok Sam they could have just made that up, the authors said, "reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars".

"Well Robert they actually went back for a better photo in fact a ten times shaper photo than the original one".

"The camera from MGS (Mars Global Surveyor) when through wispy clouds to see the face".

"But there was a day were there was no wind on a summer day and MGS scoped in really close for a second look they to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center so they could see it clearly. They got a crazy good photo with absolute maximum resolution".

"Well Sam you seem to have good exidence to back up your claim so I am here to say you proved me wrong".
