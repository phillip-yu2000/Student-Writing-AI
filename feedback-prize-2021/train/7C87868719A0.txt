Different schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning over the break. Do you believe that the projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed? In my opinion, I believe the summer projects should be teacher-designed. In my paper, I will explain why I believe so.

One of the reasons why I believe summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers would know what to include into the summer projects. They know what information to give, and what they've been learning. Teachers also know how to put different information in a way students can learn material easier. Also, teachers can include new information to get them ready for the next year.

Additionally, teacher-designed projects could also prevent cheating. If students had a chance to design a project, they would most likely make the project to where they don't have to do any work. Or they use material they've already learned, which means they're not learning anything by doing the projects. Teachers can also make different projects for each student, so their could be no copying another student's paper.

Furthermore, I believe summer projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers design all the work during school, so they should continue to do so. And that is because students never design any work during the school year, so they probably would not know how to design a project. Some may forget important imformation and details, which can effect learning. Teachers know the best to get students to learn new information and materials.

In conclusion, I believe teachers should design the summer projects for students. I believe so because they know what to include in the project. Additionally, they can prevent cheating. And furthermore, they design school work all year, so they should continue to do so.
