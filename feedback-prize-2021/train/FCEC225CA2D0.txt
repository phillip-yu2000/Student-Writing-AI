Imagine that someone in your life gave advice and the people who is receiving the advice think that this is not enough to have. However, people go to others to get more advice to feel more confident in their selves.

I usually go to more than one person because it helps me to understand the advice that I'm getting. People should go get some advice, so they know they ready to do something.

The people that need more advice than just one person they go to multiple to get more advice. First, some people go to their fiends then their family. Also, in particular the people that just need one person to give them some advice means that they feel confident in them selves. For example, people sometimes need more advice to decide what to do next. People also would probably go to their friends more than their parents. Such as you really enjoy hanging with your friends than getting nab or being boss around by your parents. in conclusion people would like to get more advice to pick which one would be better.

people need to pick wich advice is better. if they don't they're at risk of getting hurt or losing someone as a friend.

So, thats why you would figure out which advice is better. First, people could make a list of the good and also the bad. For example:

just do what you want

I would ask yourself if you want to tell him or not.

I would just do number 2 because i think that is worded more like someone will say. In conclusion, you sould pick the right advice or you would face some consequences.

People would give advice and then pick the good advice from the options.

people get more advice to get more thing to chose what to do. when you have advice pick the good one. Lastly, you would pick more advice so you have more choice to deal with.
