Dear Principle,

I think that all students should be required to perform community service.

I think that all students should be required to perform community service because it is a great way to give back to people that may be less fortunate than us.

Community service is also fun to do.

I have helped pack for soldiers overseas and it was a blast.

There was a live band and after I was done I felt like I had really made a difference in someone's life.

I think that we should be required to do community service because it helps others in so many ways.

Just shoveling a neighbors driveway or side walk could mean the world to them if they are injured or elderly.

It would just take an hour out of your day to shovel someone's driveway and would help them dearly.

Also, the students may see how lucky they are and may not take as many things for granted.

Now since I have done community service I now try to not take my home, family, and food for granted.

Community service also teaches you how to work together.

When I helped pack for the soldiers there was a huge pile of boxes that had to be filled and shipped.

I remember thinking that we could never pack all those boxes in just two hours.

But, by working together the volunteers and I we were able to pack all the boxes with time to spare.

All of these reasons are why I think that the School should be required to perform community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
