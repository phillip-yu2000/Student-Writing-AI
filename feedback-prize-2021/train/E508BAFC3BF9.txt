Yes I agree with this quote, beacuse every students have a chance to learn, so in my opinion, I think that is a great opportunity, for all of them to learn. Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

At that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day.

It's not noly online you take the class online but, you will have a viedo conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you.

The school give them a big opportunity to progress, to have a good education and a better future.

For me it is a great option for them to attend it.
