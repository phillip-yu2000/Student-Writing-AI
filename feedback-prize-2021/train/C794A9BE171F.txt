Dear principal,

Cell phones in school has brought up many debates recently about whether they are to be banned at school or if they will be allowed to be used by students during free time such as lunch, before and after school, or other free times.

Of the proposals that you have suggested I believe that allowing students to use cell phones during free time is a wiser decision.

With this option students will have the chance to contact parents about changes of events or other news that may be necessary.

This proposal is a wise decision.

I believe this because due to today's fast pace many people are very busy during the day.

By letting students be linked to the mobile world during free time I believe that grades will improve because students will not be worried or stressed about what is going on outside of school.

I also believe that if students have free time where they will be allowed to use technology such as cell phones, cell phone use in class will decrease.

Allowing students to use cell phones during free time is a wiser decision than to ban all cell phone use.

Of your policies I believe your first is a better decision, while your second has major flaws.

With your second policy to ban all cell phones at school, I believe that many students will suffer academically.

Because cell phone use would be banned many students would sneak use during class, instead of during a free time where they would be permitted.

If this were to happen students would not pay any notice to the lesson being taught and grades would suffer.

Many students would also be at a loss because contact to parents would be very difficult and schedule changes would go unnoticed.

Your second policy has many major flaws.

Your first policy to allow cell phone use during free time such as lunch, before and after school, and during other free time is a wiser decision.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
