I support driverless cars for many reasons. The main reason is safety. Another reason I support these cars is because they will be smarter and better drivers than an average person. In the end, this could also end up saving many people a lot of money on gas. Driverless cars could be a bright future.

In order to get these cars to be legal and available for purchase and driving, the safety of people must be a sure thing. This means car manufactures will have to work hard to ensure that safety will not be a concern for the driver, other drivers, or anyone else. Technology has advanced to the point where computers know more that most of the general population, so taking the wheel out of the hands of the driver for about ninety percent of the time is actually a lot safer than leaving it in their hands.

People tend to make many mistakes while driving, and that can cause problems. But letting a car drive itself could end up being the best idea ever. A car that knows where it's going will be less likely to make a mistake than a human driver. This could help to aviod accidents, accidently or purposely breaking the law, and other dangerous situations.

These cars also are suppose to save people money on gas, because it wouldn't use as much gas as cars do now. If it uses have the gas as cars do now, people won't to buy gas as often. That can save people money. Money is always a factor in every situation. The more you save, the better.

In conclusion, I support driverless cars. They can end up being safer than humans driving cars, they can be smarter, and they can use less gas. Driverless cars seem to have more ups than downs. I hope to see driverless cars become a big thing in the near future.
