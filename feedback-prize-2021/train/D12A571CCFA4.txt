I dont even know what this place is,i cant write about this! There is an ongoing debate on weather working on projects during the summer time should be teacher-deigned or student-designed. Those who oppose state students will get more knowledge and challenge students,but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design the projects.

There are a variety of reasons students should design the projects. First, students will easier projects. We go to school for nearly 10 months out of a year and work hard so we should have easy projects. Also,students have sports that they play during the summer. And if they design the project they can do it about the sports they play. During the summer it is hot and thats the perfect time for families to be going on vacations they can make a project about the places they went. Students can learn from other students .Some students, teachers and staff can not go on vacation so if another student does a project on a place someone did not know about they learned about a new place.

There are further reasons students should design the projects. Us students work during the year and do school related projects. So if we go out and explore other activities and then do the project about it well make school much more exciting. Also, Family time, students can write about what they did with their family or new family they met and did not they had. Last, the weather in summer is great we are out enjoying the weather playing on playgrounds and at water parks teachers would not have thought about doing a project on water parks but students will.

Although some may disagree,the projects students do should be student designed. This is the case due to make projects easier,creative ideas,and student explore and learn new thing. Those who oppose state get more knowledge and challenge students but this is not true. The summer should be kept for our fun time and wanting to do a project about something we liked or enjoyed over the summer.
