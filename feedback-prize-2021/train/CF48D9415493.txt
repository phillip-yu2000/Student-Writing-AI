How would you feel if there is a machine that can tell you how youe feeling or what your emotions are?

Well there is a software that is the lastest innovation from professer. I think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in classrooms is valuable because its important for students to know how students are doing and feeling. Some students probably dont want to talk about how their feeling because there probably scared or something . Some kids in school go through depression which is bad because if kids go through depression, some kids will commit sucide and we dont want that to happen. For that computers to read humans minds, it has to have all fourty-four major muscles like in a human , then it also has to move like what humans muscle do. In this new software or invention, it can track your facial expressions and movement. Which that is amzaing because I really want to help our other students or kids out so they wont go through sad,depressed,mad,etc.

My conclusion to this is that its very helpful to have a machine to read or can tell how kids are doing now. We dont want student nor kids going to think about committing suicdue. We lost so much syduents or kids because they are going bullying. If they being bullyed you can at least talk to them or try to have the new invention read their emotions. Everyone is imporatant to this world.
