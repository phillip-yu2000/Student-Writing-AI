I think students should do community service because the earth needs our help. Many huge companies hurt the earth by burning fossil fuels and that hurts the earth in many ways. If we don't help the earth who is? Everyday people uses cars to go to work and buses to bring your kids to school but all the smoke gets stuck in the earth and makes it hotter then it needs to be. If we recycle it helps the earth very much. Many people throw away plastic bottle water and that goes to our lakes, rivers, and oceans. People drink bottle water so much that put them together and it goes around the earth. If we keep doing little by little we can make earth a better place to live for us and animals. If we don't do nothing now very soon there would be no earth or humans. When you think about it its very important to do something. They're many little every day things you can do to help like car pool with friends, recycle, and save energy. The world is a very special place that we need to take care of. Like a mother takes care of her baby we need to do the same with the earth. We all need to do something to make a change. We have to reuse, renew, and recycle. All the things that look little makes a huge change in the world. So I do think students should help the earth by doing community service.
