Dear Principal,

I know that cell phones are a big problem in today's world and schools. But it is very important to have phones because what if a friend or family member is in the hospital, how can they get a hold of them without having a phone. And if you have a no cell phone policy people are just going to sneak in phones. And just get in trouble when they get caught. Some parents might protest if phones are banded. Because those parents bought those for there kids so they can talk.

I think you should go with policy 1, which is where you allow students to have their phones in school but turned off, expect at lunch. The reason is what if your athletes need to call their parents to pick them up. Or the game is home not away. That is why policy 1 is the best choice for your school.
