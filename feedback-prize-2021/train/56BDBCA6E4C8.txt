I think that it's a great idea. Students should focus on their grades to participate in sports.

A grade of a B- is good enough. Students just need to study more and turn in homework.

If they want to do sports and they have bad grades, there either not understanding it or not doing their work in class. To do sports, students have to earn that grade that they want.

Sports will give them a extra thing to do instead of sitting at home all day. If students have a

C or lower, they can't do sports. But if they have at least a B- or higher, they have earned the right to do sports. I know all ready that a lot of teenagers want to do sports to sometimes get away from home. It's good to be active and not sit in the house. Honestly that is a good idea to persuade teenagers to get a B-

or higher to participate in sports. I guarantee that the students will do a lot better than before.

They will study hard and make sure that they get the grade they want.
