I believe that driverless cars are a unique idea and they are very helpful but they can also be not so helpful. According to the article, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. So what is the point of having a driverless car when the vehicle requires a driver at all times for safety reasons.

According to Dr. Werner Hubner, a BMW project manager states "We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way". The passage informs us that some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertaniment and information systems that use heads-up displays. This will hopefully help solve our few issues we have with the driverless cars. The passage also states that "such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over - something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell-phone."

Manufacturers are doing many things to make sure that they have no problems with the driverless cars and they are working to solve any problems thye have with them. According to this article, manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver." I feel liek it is a great idea that manufacturers are really trying to fix all the problems that we may face with these new driverless cars. It is alwyas important for us to be safe.
