Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I, as a student of this school, and a fellow athlete, think that it is completely un-fair for a student to maintain a B average to participate in any sports or any other activities. For some of the athletes we have at SCHOOL_NAME it is very hard for us to maintain a high average. Students here are completely satisfied with the fact that they have a passing grade, which in most cases is a C. One main reason we, students, do not like this policy change is because when we have say a Volleyball game coming up and our most valuable player cannot make it because she was making a 72 in Math class, this s not fair to the coaches, nor the players or the team. We want to set a good example for our school, but we can't do that without a valuable player. We want our school to be a great school in the eyes of the other school, but if we can't have any good games to show how hard our school works, we wont have anything to show for. Other school activities like the after school program. We play games and we have fun, but we can do that without finishing our work first, so in order to do that we have to have a passing average, our passing average now is a C, so if we change it now, we will have to work ten times harder to get that passing average for a B. We don't feel this is a comfortable situation. Our school loves the policy we have now, and we would love it if it stayed the same and didn't change. Our school has many great people here, and we don't want them to leave us for another school, because they get to maintain a C average over there.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and i hope that you take what i have said into consideration. We hope you make the right choice.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
