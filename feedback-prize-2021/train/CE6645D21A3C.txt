DEAR TEACHER_NAME, I heard that we cant play any sports or other activity without a B average. I think this is unfair because student that do try their best sometimes still get a C and they want to participate in sports and other school activity. Also you shouldn't judge a student on how good their grade is. Because some kids with A

and a B are mostly the who gets in trouble. I think as long as you have a

C average you should participate in sports and or school activities. Like say your son had a C average and he wanted to play sports but his principal told him that he had to have a B average to play football. And he came home all depress because he try hard in school but still gets a C average and he wants to play football what will you tell him. Keep on tying you can do it don't give up. and he says he always try hard and he already given up he wont be a football player when he grow up like he wanted. That's how we feel to much pressure and we give up we don't try hard anymore. Is that what our teacher parents and government want .us to do quit think about it .

your truly, STUDENT_NAME
