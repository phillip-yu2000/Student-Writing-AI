I know we all like to have fun or have some time to do what ever you want, like spend some time on the computer, play with your dog or cat, talk to your friends on the phone, go out shopping and more, but think about it. Think about the little innocent puppy or cat in a tight little cage and know one to play with them or take care of them like they need to be taken care of, and with know one to help him/ her find a nice loving family of his own. Think about the people that don't have food to eat in a day sometimes in almost a week because of their financial problems and that they sometimes don't even have family. Think about all that and more.

Imagine you can change all that just by giving a few minuets of your time to the people that need it, to the animals that need it and to do some community work and change the life of many people a living in, for a better future for a better future in not only in their life but in yours to. Help us make a better future, now think about all you can change in the future just by spending a few minutes of your time, you can make a difference not only in you community but in the world i step at a time...
