Dear Mr. Senator,

I believe that there should not be such thing as an Electoral College. I feel it is not fair to our country. When people vote they vote for who they want to win and think is best for their country but in the end, it all does not matter because the Electoral College makes the final descision. If its our country, we should be able to vote for whoever we want and who ever gets the most popular vote, wins.

I also agree with Bob Dole, "Abolish the electoral college!" It is unfair and irrational to our country. When you think about it, If 3 people: one for each member in the House Of Representatives and two for your senators, it could be unfair. What if those three people are going for Republicans? and the majority of their state that they represent votes for Democrats? it would not be fair to the rest of the state because they all wanted the opposite of what the Electoral College wanted, so the Electoral College basically gets to make the final decision of who they want in office.

Sincerely, the people of our country.    Â
