Amazing, fun, extraordinary, this is what the cars of 2020 will be! Could you have a car that drive's by it's own? Can you even believe that some cars are driverless? I know it's hard to believe when i studied about this topic it was unbelievable at first, but then I started to get in the topic a little bit more and it got promising!

Unbelievable car ready for 2020? Well in the story it say's, " Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020." This is very promising and well i'm very anxious to have a car that is driverless! For me, I think driverless cars are very exciting and they would be very safe because humans wouldn't be driving them. one reason is because humans aren't perfect and they are alway's having accidents even in the more little thing! Google cofounder Sergey Brin say's," The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."

It would be the best experience as drivers that we could ever have! Day by day technology is increasing in this world. They invent this driverless cars and later they are going to invent flying cars, it wouldn't really surprise me because of all the technology that the world has. People are increasing in knowledge and we're learning different stuff. Which is kind of interesting knowing how everything started, which i believe it was by God.

In conclusion, this driverless car idea is very promising and very realistic. It's going to be very fundamental because in the story it talks about the car is going to use half the fuel that taxis use which for the United States of America this would be very good savings! This idea is the best idea i've heard about cars because they care about the safety of the driver. So why not be anxious for a driverless car that's going to be ready in 2020!
