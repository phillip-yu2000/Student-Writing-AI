I think you should sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program. The progam lets you see sights that you would never see in your life. The program also lets you help people that need food. While you are out on the water you get to relax for a while and get away from loud city noises.

The first reason you should consider signing up is that you get to see beautiful sights in different countries. Going and seeing different countries is something you would never do in your life but, if you sign up you will be able to go and see things that you would only see in pictures. Going to these countries is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

The second reason to sign up is that you get to help people. While your gone you get to help people have a better life. You get to get them cows , chickens ,etc, to help them farm and get better meals. Getting people food saves their life and betters it. It is not as easy as going out to the store and buying food that you need. They have to farm and grow crops to eat. Giving people food that they need gives you a warm fuzzy feeling.

The third reason that you should sign up is that while your on water you get to relax and get away from loud city noises. Getting away from the city for awile is good, you get to figure out how to live away from the city. Also you get to relax and just hear the sound of water hitting the sand.

You could probably get a better night sleep after you hear the water.

I think you should go to the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to see amazing sights , you get to help people, you also get to relax on the water. These are three reasons I think you should sign up.
