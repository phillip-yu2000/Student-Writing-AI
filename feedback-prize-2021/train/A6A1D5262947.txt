Clearly with all the evidence that I have proves that The "Face on Mars" is just a naturual Landform. Researchers have done way too much to prove that it is not a face but only a landform. Everybody's opinion on The "Face on Mars" doesn't effect the truth behind it. Based on the passage, In paragraph 3, it explains that NASA unveiled the image for everybody to see. They explained that it was just a "huge rock formation" . . . which resembles an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth formed by shadows.

There is also more reasons as why this is clearly just a natural landorm.

NASA had to make sure they were correct on there research, therefor the orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the original Viking's photo. Which then clearly proved that there so no alien movement after all and once again that it was just a natural landform.

NASA's group didn't yet give up there research on the "Face on Mars". they rolled there spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of the view to make sure they didn't miss anything. In paragraph 11, It explains that if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see what they were. Which clearly proves that NASA did all the research but yet could not prove anything but a naturual landform.

To conclude my argument, throughout all the research proof and examples i have stated. There is absoulty no research explaniations that proves that the "Face on Mars" is anything but a natural landform. Which clearly means that NASA's research is correct and all the research they have done to make it clear was correct.
