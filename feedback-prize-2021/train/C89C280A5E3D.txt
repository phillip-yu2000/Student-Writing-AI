Imagine that the president the majority of the people voted for did not win because the electoral college got confused and voted for the wrong candidate. That would not happen if we didnt have a electoral college. I believe that we should change the electoral college to election by popular vote because the electoral college can cause a catastophe and is unfair.

The electoral college can cause a catastophe. The electoral college is basically a disaster waiting to happen. We the people of the United States would be able to do nothing if the people of the electoral college made a mistake or even was pulling a scam. Source 2 states "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would opose John F. Kennedy. (So that popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)" Many political disasters such as this would not happen if we had the election by popular vote system.

The electoral college is unfair. The system is outdated and irrational as well. Source 2 states "Because the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states." Many people that are in a electoral college state don't care aould the peoples vote and sometimes might even want to vote for the people who they want to vote for! Source 3 states "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieve a majority of the votes cast." In my opinion, this is exactly the problem. The american people have the right to do a tie breaker not the electoral college.

To conclude, the electoral college should be changed to the election by popular vote. There is not reason that the electoral college should still be the way we vote because it is not a stable way of casting votes (disaster prone) and it is unfair.
