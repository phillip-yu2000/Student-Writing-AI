You should join the Seagoing cowboys program overseas. I'f you join you will get to go to many places to help the states, or countries. You will take care animals day and night. To take care of the animals you will have to keep there stalls clean, and get their hay from the lower holds on the ship. Some places take about two weeks or even up to a few months to arrive. Once you loaded all the animals up and took care of them and the animals home is clean and provides food in the wild and in the safe areas, then you will unload the animals off the boat and take them back to where they belong. After all the animal are gone you get to have fun since there is no animals to take care of. Now that all the animals are gone you get to have fun and play games like baseball and volleyball in the empty holds that animals were in and been housed. There will also be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. So for the rest of the few weeks or so after everything is done you get to play games and have fun until it's time to get off board.
