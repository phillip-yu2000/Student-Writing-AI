Dear State Senator,

I am arguing in favor of changing the electorol college to election by popular vote for the preesident of the united states. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have know. Basically, in this process, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors could be anyone not holding public offifce. Voters cant always control whom their electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes, 538, is an even number. It is highly unlikely but one day if we dont change this, it will happen. in 1960, Hawaii sent two electors to congress, it could of ended in a disaster, luckily vice president Richard Nixon validated only his opponents electors. If their ever happened to be a tie, each state would only cast one vote, so it is not fair that say Wyoming would get as much as California which has seven times the amount of voters Wyoming has.

The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. Candidates dont spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning. During the campaign in 2000, 17 states didnt see the candidates at all, and voters didnt get to see a campaign ad. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly without much basis in reality. Abolish the electoral college!
