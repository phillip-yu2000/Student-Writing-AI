NOT

support this; Because students should have a choice on at least what to do with their free time, but instead something like this would take that from them and pressure them, making that in the real world when they do have a choice whether they will do something or not they might feel pressured to do it anyways, or when they do get time to themselfs they would be confused as to what they CAN do. If students already are being given lots of work by teachers or have lots of chores to do meaning with clubs it would put even more for them to need to do makig the homework have to be done when they should be asleep because of they still need to do their chores once they get home.

Students would have a harder time making a choice for what club they would be in if they dont like any available ones, not to metion majority would would probobly pick the one that sounds like the least work out of them all meaning they would either have to choose it again until they can fit everyone into the clubs or put more into that one club which might take out funding for other clubs (in simple words it can easily and hevily backfire against them, and anyone that really works in a school probobly wont admit that it will definitly happen at least once but still it's a valid reason to put in).
