Dear Principal,

Changing the new grade policy for sports and other school activities is not a good idea in my opinion. Right now many students have a grade C average. If you change the policy to a grade B average many student will be upset.

A lot of the student athletes work hard in school and sports. Some however may not be the best in school but they still can obtain a grade C average.

Many athletes will be very upset if they can not participate in their sports. If the policy is changed these student athletes will have a lot of stress trying to obtain a grade B average and wont be able to focus on their actual sport. Also many other students will be upset if they do other school activities and cant go to them without a grade B average. I and many other students can agree that changing the grade policy for sports and other activities is not a very wise idea.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
