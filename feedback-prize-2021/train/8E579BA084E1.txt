Do you think that having a driverless car is honestly for safety reasons or just for famous and to just be able to say, " oh look my car can drive itself!" ?

In this artical the author talks about how it can be safer, how it will save money on gas millage and some other things. In my opion i think this is a horrible idea and im going to tell you why by just pulling facts from this artical. For my first reason why i dont think this is a good idea is because in the artical it states, " the cars will need a whole lot of sensors." Ok, that to me sounds horrible because, what if one sensor goes bad and the driver has no idea and it becomes to late to find out and next thing you know BAAAMMM theres an accident that happens. My second reason why i think this isnt a good idea is, they clam that the cars will have, "antilock brakes" and what happens when the brakes dont become "antilock" anymore? A wreck and even death happens. My third areguement is this. They state that there waiting on the "Law", i believe that the law is thinking correctly on why their not sure whether to let this be okay or to not let this be okay. In the Artical is states, " new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident." If i was driving a car like this and i hit someone and killed them or just got in a plan wreck , i would blame the manufacture. Ony because when someone buys these driverless cars they are told a bunch of things and as a driver i would expect to belive that this car will do all of those things. So, whether new laws were passed if these things would to become legal, i would still put up a fight for that it would also have to be the manufactures' fault also. That right there is my third reasoning on why i dont think this is a good idea.

These are all my three reasons from the artical on why i dont think that driverless cars will be a good impact in the world today, or ever.
