Dear Principal,

I believe that policy one is the best policy.

With this students would not sneak there phones around and they would probably pay more attention during class time.

This policy does not have a bad effect to it as far as my knowledge goes.

It would make students happier and make sure that people are paying full attention during all class periods.

I feel that teachers would like this policy also because then students wouldn't say anything if they were to use their phones during class time. This creates an equal opportunity for students and teachers as far as cell phone use goes.

A vote should go on in the school to see how the students and faculty feel about this.

My thoughts are that most of them will choose policy one.

Just making sure that phones are set to vibrate or silent would be best for this policy.

It will make sure that there are no inappropriate ring tones being played during the free times when cell phones are allowed.

My personal opinion is that most schools should consider this policy because it is in the best interest of their students.

It is a great way to better connect with the students.

This also gives them more freedom in school.

I think it will greatly affect the attitude that students have during the day.

This is because they will be able to contact there friends during all hours of the day instead of being cut off from connection from 8 to almost 2:30.

These are just the simple reasons that i think cell phones should be used during school hours as long as they are put away during class time.
