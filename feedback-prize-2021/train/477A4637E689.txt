Dear administrative,

I think all students should do community service because some students have to much time on there hands. Also students should do community service because our world would be better whether its just cleaning up the litter from people that throw things on the grown or to go to different elementary schools and help the younger kids with work. If our students at SCHOOL_NAME were able to do community service i think our community will be a lot better. Our community would be better by our kids and parents in the local district being happier and also they would be happier in what we did in our community by making our community cleaner and safer. I believe if we were able to do community service at our local elementary schools students would learn to like school better and learn that what ever they do in school it can get you a good job, also it would get kids to have a better education. Also for kids to help our community to get up and go help out our planet by making good choices and going out and picking up peoples litter because our animals out there are getting hurt. Our birds our fish and other animals they are just like people and people wouldn't want there homes looking trashed by the litter. The same with our animals it would help our animals live in better and safer homes. If we had community service at SCHOOL_NAME middle school our community would be better.
