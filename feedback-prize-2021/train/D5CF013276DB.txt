Dear senator,

I believe that the electoral college should be dissolved and replaced with election by popular vote.  The electoral college is a flawed system that has resulted in several unfair elections such as the 2000 election in which Al Gore won by popular vote, but lost the election because Bush had a majority of the votes from the electoral college.  Also the members of the electoral college are not obligated to vote for the candidate chosen by the people but could willingly vote for the candidate of their choice.  Also, "Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate" this system could greatly off set the election.

"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president," this system goes completely against the constitution in that "We the People" don't elect our own president.  I thoroughly believe that we should move on to election by popular vote, because there would be less problems with the presidential election.
