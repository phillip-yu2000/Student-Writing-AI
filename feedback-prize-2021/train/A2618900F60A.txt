The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Unlike the aliens theory, we have poof that it just a landform. It's not werid to see something like that.

The Face on Mars, it is rare to see this, and it's not normal, but on earth we have we have odd things to see here. Like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. We have odd shape things on Earth too, so seeing a face is not that odd, it's amazing, but it not something that had to be made by aliens.

Also we have proof, the Mars Orbiter Camera took lots of pictures and revealed it to be just a normal landform. It formation does look like a head, the shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. So it is a huge rock, since it look like face , we give the people the idea that it was made to look like an face, but in reality it just a huge rock.

Inconclusion, the Face is just a natural landform. The alien theory is wrong, and the face is nothing special. We have proof and reasons why it's not made by aliens.
