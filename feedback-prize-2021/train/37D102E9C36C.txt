Dear Principal,

The community is very important to us. Some students find that community service is necessary while others are unsure. In my opinion, community service should be required of students attending school, because it will help towards the cleanliness of the community and benefits of different citizens. Since the community is so important to us, why shouldn't it be clean, or why shouldn't those who need help, get it? Volunteering can be done in a number of ways. For example, roads can quickly become filled with trash. How can we help this if we don't have enough workers? We can undertake with community service. With the help of the students at school we can help lead the community to a safe, clean, enjoyable place to live. Could you imagine living with trash everywhere? The problem could easily be solved. Students should be required to pick an option to help the community. For example, tutoring elementary school kids can be very beneficial. While helping younger students, you can learn more by reviewing what you have already learned and teaching yourself skills on working with others. Another way to volunteer is by working at an animal shelter. Many animals that do not already have homes are left by themselves in kennels, daily. Why shouldn't they be taken care of, or played with? One can devote themselves to doing something they love, while also playing a huge part in society. Overall, students should be required to devote time to community service. With just a little help from people, you can make a big change.

Sincerely,

Student
