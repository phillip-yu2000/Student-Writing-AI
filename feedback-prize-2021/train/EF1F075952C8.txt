Dear Principal,

Not everyone is a very well student but they always give there 100% best every time but cant seem to not always get good grades. You should at least let people with C averages still be able to play the sport they want because at least they passed. Passing is something that's a very good thing so you can go on to the next level. I know that if you get only a 70 as passing its ok but usually people if they work hard enough can get better grades and bring up there average.

We students don't think its fair not seeing our friends we have not being able to play on the team sport with us because they have a C average. It seems like were apart from some of our friends when we planned on playing a team sport together but we don't. This makes us sad and makes us not want to even join a sport because with out our friends we don't think we could stay as strong at times and have someone to help us along the way.

Please let C average people play a team sport because passing should make them aloud to play a sport with working hard and trying there best to work hard and passing. Not everyone can get higher then C average's. We as students disagree with you not allowing C average students to not play a sport.

Sincerely,
