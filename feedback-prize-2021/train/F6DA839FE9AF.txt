With technology making advancements everyday, it is natural that we adapt and adopt new forms of technology in our lifes, houses, hospitals, schools and even prisons,however, some technologies might get too far into our lives and into our heads.

A new software developed at the University of Illinois promises to read and detect facial expressions that reveal how we felt at the moment the picture or camera footage was recorded. The project is now in early stages of development but is already able to read paintings and describe what they feel.

In his text "Making Mona Lisa Smile", Nick D'Alto states that " if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.", stating that the software can be used to monitor people and detect what products they take interest in, which is an unethical way to push companies into people's lives; moreover, the author claims that students can have their facial expressions monitored so that if they become bored, the computer can adjust the lesson to make it more engaging to the student. Although students have different needs, the usage of surveilance to capture their interest can be compared to the way babies are shown colorful and animated things to keep their attention, which can make the student's attention span even smaller than it has become, alienating and making them more dependant of technology.

In conclusion, the usage of this software to either sell products or monitor students is unethical at the least, and can lead to an even more alienated population.
