I believe that the aurthor of this writing is going on the right track. I am going to argue that the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" is something that will happen, and that it isnt something that will be fiction but rather fact.

The author of this article states that sometime in the near future there will be a time that cars wont need drivers and I believe that he/she is corect because of the factual information that he involves in the article. He/She also states that companies are already attempting to create a truly, 100% diverless car, and I belive that in the near future that can be a true possibility. I also think that in the future people will still try and criticise the car but in truth the so called "driverless" car will become true and it will work up to what the article states and possibly even better than what is stated in the article. Aslo in the case of an accident I believe that the blame will go both to the manufacture and the driver because it was the manufature's work and it was the driver's responsibility to keep an eye on the road anyway.

In concusion I believe that in the near or farther future we will eventualy have driverless cars around just as much as we have actual driver required cars today. Also with all of the testing and the advancements in technology, the "driverless" cars isn't somnething of fiction but rather something af a very possibly fact. So all that i can really say is that I do believe in a time that no one will buy cars bacause no one needs them anymore.
