High school is a rough time for students unfortunatly. During this time of their life they are going though a lot of changes and have a lot of emotions. Sometimes these emotions cause them to make some unhealthy life dissisions which could lead them down the wrong path.

This could help the students talk about what is bothering them and work though it.
