I STUDENT_NAME disagree to the principal on considering school policy so that the students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average . I disagree with the principal because in order to pass high school you have to have good grade and ONE exception of a C . For example , If a student have good behavior and a C on their report card their is a possible chance they make get accepted. This is one reason why the students with a C grade should be able to participate in sports and other activities. Another reason to why students should be able to participate in sports and other activities is because students can be active and fit for sports and other activities. Students with low grades can do extra time with playing sports to get a increase on their grade to help them be able to participate in many other sports and activities. I also believe that if the student have bad behavior and a C then they shouldn't be able to participate but if they have very good behavior and have a C and show effort into getting a better grade then they should be able to have a chance in participating in sports and other activities. In conclusion , this is why students with a grade C average should be able to participate in sports and any other activities.
