Are you for or against driverless cars?

I am for driverless cars.

Driverless cars could decrease the amount of accidents.

Also, if you get an important phone call, you can answer and not have to worry about getting in an accident.

Driverless cars seem like a great idea to me.

It would be great to have because then drivers won't usually have to worry about crashing.

If there is an area on the road that needs to be driven by a human, the car can just give a signal to notify the driver of like road construction or if there was an accident.

If there are smart cars, there should also be smart roads.

Smart roads would most likely eliminate all chances of a crash or accident.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars will be in the very near future.

I feel like it would make driving a lot safer.

It could possibly eliminate all possibilties of a car crash or accident to occur if smart roads were built.

In the future, we all might be an owner of a driverless car.
