Wouldn't you like to be able to do your make up in the car without worrying about crashing? Or perhaps bring back a loved one that passed away due to crashing or a mobile accident? With the driveless cars i think that you could. Accidents are one of the greatest problems in not only america but in whole world. You wont be able to bring back a loved one that passed away butity will be more preventable now. I think that driveless cars will be a great idea.

People die every day due to mobile accidents. For example i have an uncle that past away because he was in an accident. The whole family was destroyed, it shook our lifes up. With the driveless cars i feel like accidents will reduce by alot.

The drivelss cars will be very helpful. For example not every morning you wake up on time, if your running late you could do your make up in the car while your on way to work or wherever you need to be. Also if you need to take a call or you need to text someone, you wont have to worry about crashing and putting peoples lifes on risk because the car drives itself. Lastly, taking care of your kids, everyone has or has a baby in the car and know the struggle when they cry or get hungry, its not so pleasing but with the driveless car you would easly be able to assist them.

Safety wouldnt be a big issue. You wouldnt have to care or be worried that your children are going to get run over because with the driveless care it was sensors for it to stop when its near an oblect or the seat will start buzzing for you to to stop. The driveless car would still be steerable incase soemthing goes wrong or it doesnt stop.

Many things will be prevented with the driveless cars such as deaths and dangerous injuries. You could assist your children, do your needs, and most importantly theirnwill be more safety for everyone. Thats why i think that having driveless cares are a good idea.
