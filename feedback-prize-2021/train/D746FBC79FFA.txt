Dear Principal,

I am all for community service. If students are required to do different services we will become a better community. Say, if 10 students pick up garbage around the community each day it will become cleaner. If we have students to tutor the younger children in elementary, we are sure to see there grades and scores change. Also, for them to do better in school.

I can also see how some students would not want to do this. Some students are dedicated to sports or clubs. Which means that they have school then practice/ meetings right after. Once they get home they have to do all there homework or study for a test. Understanding they have chores and other stuff to do at home. Some students do not have a lot of time at all.

If you really want us to help out our community you could make it a extra class for college credits or bonus for a class. Doing this would make students want to help out a lot more. It's a win, win situation. The community is becoming cleaner and more joined as a whole. While students are earning better grades and getting credits for college.

As you can see, our community and students can gain from this. It's just how we reward the students for there service. Of course, if you help them out with college or to get better grades they are going to want to do it. On the other hand if you don't reward them with anything, fewer students are going to want to help out the community.

I am thinking this could really work.

I really hope you take into consideration my views on the issue. I am hoping to see the community change for the better. Not the worst. Thank you for all of your time!
