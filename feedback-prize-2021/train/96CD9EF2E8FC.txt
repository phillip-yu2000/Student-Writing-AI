Dear principal i think that you are right. students should not be able to play sports unless they have a B average. i think that its very fair. first, students would not get enough study time if they still play sports with a lower than a B. there grade would likely drop because all they would care about is practicing the sport they play. students should play the game but also get in enough study time after. if they do that there grade will go up. students should care more about there grade than anything else that goes on around school. it would be great to have perfect grades in school. also, if students have a below B average for the whole year they might never make it back to the team for the whole rest of the year. then they would learn there lesson that studying comes before sports. i think that would also teach them to study a lot more so they can make it back on the team. if students have a below B average they should not be allowed back on the team until they learn to study and work harder in school. i think that you are right. keep up the good work sincerely, the student
