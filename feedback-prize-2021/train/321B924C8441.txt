Dear principal,

I think you should go with policy number 1. Because it might help kids do better in school. Some kids bring cell phones too school because they need them, to call there mom or for an emergency. You never know this days.

I do agree with policy number 1 because having kids have there phone off in class is good. Having kids have the phones on when its lunch time or free time is good.

But not having phone at all in school don't you think have a little unfair didn't you want cell phones allowed in your school when you went to school. If you did then this can be you time to change it. You can make the rules the way you wanted when you were a kid and having cell phone in school you can change that don't follow some other people opinion This is your school Have it the way you want it. But if you didn't want cell phones in you school when you were a kid well all i got to say about this.... are you crazy woman. Sorry about that but i really think you should allow cell phone in school. I think it will make alot of student happy and maybe even some teacher too. You never know these days. Well i have to get back to my other homework so please principal just think about changing the school policy to number 1 policy.

Sincerely,

Student from you school

P.S. I think you a really good principal. Have a good day and keep the school great.
