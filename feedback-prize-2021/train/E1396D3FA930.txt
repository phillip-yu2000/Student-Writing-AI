I dont think the a computer reading emotins would be valuable in a classroom because technology is not always acurrate. We use a lot of different facial muscles when just making one facial expression. Student dont really show emotion when the class their in is boring.

One reason i dont think its valuable because emotions can change at any moment .Saying someone is 80% happy in a pictuer wouldnt always be ture becuase they could be smiling but also could be more sad than they are happy. Some people have a bipolar disoder which makes their eomtion change very fast , and some people are just very temperamental. Some students show emotions differnt than others . For example one student that is very upset could be yelling and shouting about it and another student that as angery as the other student could be very calm about it and not showing that they are angery.

Another reason i dont think its acurrate is because sometimes we dont just use one muscle to make a facial expresion. The computer only test one facial muscle to an emotion. Paragraph three states" For example , your frontails pars laterlis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surprised ..." but also when someone is surprised they sometimes move their mouth muscles. We move our mouth muscles for almost every emotion.

I dont think it would be a good idea to put one of these computers in a classroom becuase each student shows emotion different and some students might not shoe emotion at all , therefore the computer would be getting emotion from about half the claaroom which wouldnt be acurrate .
