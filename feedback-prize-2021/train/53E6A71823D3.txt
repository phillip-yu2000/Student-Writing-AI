There could be a day when we can use a device to identify human emotions. According to professor Thomas Huang and professor Nicu Sebe they both have collaborated and established a software where computers can recognize human emotions. This type of technology could not be helpful to teachers or any person who would want to see an emotional experssion of a person. Teachers should not even be bothered attempting to use the Facial Action Coding System to identify there students emotions.

Us humans are very fasinating we have an instint when someone is sad, mad or happy. In the article it tells us "You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the looks of there face."(P.5) The text itself even says that we can tell when someone is feeling the way they are by the looks of there face, we do not need a computer to detect someones feeling's.

Teachers know there students they see them everyday for a long period of time, they most likely are not going to be close to them but some students do become close to a teacher. In the text it says "Each expression is compared against a neutral face."(P.4) The author is telling us that everytime they do a emotinal expression they compare it to a regular photo. How can that show what people are feeling? In most cases most people have a neutral face when they are sad, mad or happy, they are this way because maybe no one taught them how to express their feelings. So how can you really know how that person feels?

All in all teachers are good the way they are, they do not need to dectect there students feelings. Although it would be nice to use it and come across it but teachers can ask how that person is feeling themselves.
