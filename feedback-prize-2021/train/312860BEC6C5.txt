Some schools require students to complete summer projects tto assure their learning over the summer. I think it would be more efficent for these summer assignments to be student designed, simply because arudents are students and know how it feels to be the person doing that long, boring assignment , and last minute because you've been dreading doing it.

It might be more interesting to let a student design the summer assignments. Students know what other students like, how we like to learn. A student would assign something that othe students will enjoy doing. Being a student and a teenager they would know that students love phones and technology, so they wouuld find something like making video documentaries or maybe some type of progressive learning app.

If a student were designing a summer assignment it might also be easier to comprenhend and complete. I've never liked or completed my summer assignments because they were always too long and hard to even try to complete. A student would know how it feels and make something easy to do while also educating us. Like assigning

No Red Ink to complete: while a teacher is going to give you a 1,000 page essay.

In conclusion, it would definitley be a more effecient way of learning over the summer if they were to let a student design the assignment. I think you could even let a teacher and a student work together to make something that balances fun and learning. This would make students more eager to complete assignments and more eager to learn over the summer.
