Luke Bomberger had an opportunity of a lifetime after his high school graduation, his friend asked him if he would like to join the "Seagoing Cowboys". Luke could not say no so, although it maybe dangerous, I am sure that there are alot of reason why. Here are some of the reasons why you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys".

The first and main reason why you should join is because, it would bring wonderful sightseeing opportunities and you would get to visit many new places that you wouldn't get to visit otherwise. Luke got to travel all over Europe, in my opinion almost everywhere in Europe is beautiful and has wonderful landscape so, I would probably go just for that reason. The next reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is, besides all of the hard work you also have freetime to do many fun activities such as baseball, volleyball, table-tenis, fencing, boxing, whittling, and reading to pass the time. In my opinion besides the labor involved, in a way it would almost be like sailing on a cruise ship. Finally, the final and by far most important reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because, it opens up your eyes to the world and the needs of others. Being a part of this program opened up Luke's eyes so much that for many years after, his family hosted quite a few exchange visitors and international students for some time after his incredible experience.

Those were just a few of the many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. If you love adventure and want to serve your country and other countries to then join today. It will truely be an unforgetable experience that I promise you'll never forget.
