When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person, Thats because they want to choose the right decision and if they choose wrong, then something terrible could happen, or you will just regret it. Sometimes you question your self and ask "should I do this or that?" sometimes you go with your own advice, or you go to a friend or someone. But in my opinion, I think you should always ask a friend, or a family member, for advice even if you think your advice is wiser/better than theirs.

Seeking multiple advice from different people is good because it makes gets you thinking about what to do in that situation like, "do I do this do I do that!" so you gather all the advice that you got from the people, you asked and you talk about it see if thats what you want to do, and you do it like I said your advive isn't bad, you just think that the other advice is better, like say you got accepted to two different colleges take your own advice then go get more advice from a family member or a friend, So you got their advice you compare it to yours, and see which one you like more. Seeking advice from other people is good, like I said It helps you with your everyday life.
