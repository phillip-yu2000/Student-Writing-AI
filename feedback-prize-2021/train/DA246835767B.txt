Have you ever seen Seagoing Cowboy Program go to sea? I, Luke, have went to the Seagoing Cowboy Program. It is really run. You get to go to many places. As stated in the article you get to help out people.

Would you want to go on the program? You should really think about it. If you like to explore or help people out you would like it. If you don't like those things you wouldn't be a big fan. If you wouldn't do it you would regret it later.

In the article it says that he was happy to be alive. When I was little my aunt Katie's farm as a boy prepared him for work. It helps to know that helping out taught me to be responsible. I was always busy helping. I aslo had fun on board. I got to help with things on board.

Also stated in the article it says that I had no idea that my life would change soon after my high school graduation. My friend Don Reist innvited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. After World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.

I hope I've made you want to come to the program. If not try to think more about it. I would not change it for the world. You get to spectate so many places around the world. Would you go to the problem?
