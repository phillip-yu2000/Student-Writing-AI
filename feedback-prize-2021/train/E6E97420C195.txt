Beep.. Beep.. Beep... That is the sound of someone's heart monitor at a hospital. can you imagine waking up in the hospital after a car wreck. Well it's happened plenty of times, but the accident was never caused by a driverless car. What about the new laws they will have to make for these new cars? These cars will never happen, and if they do they will cause many accidents in the future.

In the article I had just read it says "Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident." Say you were to get in a wreck while driving a driverless car, and the car wouldn't use its break so you went through a stop sign and hit another car and someone was killed in the accident. Who's fault is it? Is it your fault for hitting the other car, or is it the manufactures fault for not safely making your vehicle?

Driverless cars are not safe and never will be. Technology always has a glitch somewhere. In the article Driverless Cars are Coming, the talk about sensors in paragraphs four to seven. "The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." This was said in paragraph seven of the article. But why would they make these driverless cars if they can only reach 25 mph.? Most people would want a driverless car for interstates and highways, because those are the most boring roads in history.

Driverless cars are not safe, they can cause many accidents and who's at fault, you or the manufacturer? Companies just need to stop trying to make driverless cars because they aren't going to be sucessful for society today. Cars need to be human driven and that's all. No driverless cars are coming, not now not ever!
