The face on mars is just a natural landform , but John thinks it was created by aliens. The " Face on Mars " has since become a pop icon . The text says " It has starred in a Hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines , radio talk shows , even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!" This is basically saying that " The Face on Mars" has been around for several years.

John assumes that " The Face on Mars " was created by aliens , but from my perspective its just a natural landform. The text states in stanza 12 " What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa , landforms common around the American West." The text is basically saying the the face is a common thing . The photo in 1976 spans 43 meters per pixel . The photo in 2001 spans 1.56 meters . This means that peole couldn't really tell what it was they were taking educated guesses. The " Face on Mars " is actually called a mesa . Few scientist believed that the face was an alien artifact. The text states " Thousands of anxious wed surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site , revealing ... a natural landform . There was no alien monument after all." This means that Johns statement sayin that the " Face on Mars " was created by aliens is incorrect . Its just a natural landform , but not everyone was satisfied with the real answer . People think that NASA is trying to hide the real evidence . The text states " Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide , say conspiracy theorists." The author only did this to attract attention for Mars.

Therefore , " The Face on Mars " is just a natural landform . The face on Mars has been around for several years . The author just wanted to get the public and attract attention to Mars.
