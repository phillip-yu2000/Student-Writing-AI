To the Principal,

Cell phones are one of the most essential elements in anybody's life. In a high school student, the cell phone is essentially important. I agree that cell phones are a distraction in class, but I see no particular reason for banning cell phones in lunch periods, when it is a social time for the students to kick back and relax, or answering to an emergency, and if using cell phones is their way of relaxing than I see no reason of banning them completely.

The cell phone is used for calling and messaging. Sure, most of the calls are related to social issues, but there is also a chance their could be an emergency in tact. What if a loved one was in a car crash, or brutally hurt or ill? The school phone simply isn't useful in positions like this when something personal is supposed to be passed on. And if in free times and lunch, the phone is banned, there is simply no way to pass on the message in a dignified manner, and you will be the reason to blame if you don't choose banning cell phones only in class.

The high school student's social life is the essence and foundation to a healthy and successful high school career. But the cell phone is the entrance to many student's social lives. Do you want a student to transverse into a depression, because he doesn't have the time to use the phone because of homework after school, and now in school? Do you want him to commit suicide? All you have to do to prevent that is choose Policy number one.

If those reasons are what you're looking for, then I don't know what reasons you're looking for. To give a student a social life, to keep their life personal, or to prevent them from hanging themselves, just choose policy number one. That is what I would do if I were you, ma'am.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
