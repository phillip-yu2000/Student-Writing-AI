When the world was introduced to driverless cars, one thing came to my mind. Where is the fun in learning how to drive if you can't control what you drive? Yes I get that it could prevent traffic jams and take you the most fastest way to your destination according to traffic, but just because you are able to do what ever while the computer takes you to the place you are going, doesn't mean you can. According to traffic laws, the driver of a vehicle must be awake and alert to his/her surroundings. This is called defensive driving.

Where do I stand on this situation? I honestly can say that I am against driverless cars. I think this becasue, just because you are not driving doesn't mean you don't have to pay attention. According to the artile, BMW made a car that was somewhat driverless going 25 miles per hour. Then it finishes by saying that the steering wheel has presure sensitive fibers so it can make sure you still have ahold of the steering wheel at all time.

So in concluson, driverless cars are unsafe for now. Now I'm not saying that this will never happen, but for now, it is highly unlikely that something like this will become avalible in the near future. More materials might come out and make cars more safe than they already are, but it still won't protect us from computer driven cars. This is because computers are electronic, meaning they can be tampered with, hacked, and even shut down while in the middle of something. Also they can malfunction and take you to the wrong place or even drive you off a cliff or into water. So until then, all cars need an awake and alerted driver.
