OUR PRINCIPAL JUST MADE SCHOOL BETTER!!! I bet your wondering how. He's making us students participate in at least one activity. I feel as if we do activity's we can have a good mindset because first, having a good mindset is a key in life; if you dont feel good about yourself then how will you win in life. It makes something hard and gives a challenge and lets us know that things dont come easy and go our way all the time the way we planned it. Say the activity is hard and the whole school is racing and competting in this challenge that the principle has assigned for us. We have to learn to strive for what we want and not just give up because we dont get it, or it's to hard. If you give up the how will you win the challenge, learn form your mistakes so you dont make the sameone again later.

However, if dont like it, its going to be a everyday thing so soon or later you going to like it, but look on the bright side; you get out of class, dont have to do work, and you get to socialize with your friends our other people you dont know, try to make new friends you never know those new friends could be better than your friends that you have now. At least you have something else to keep yourself active, instead of doing work.

Some people need it, but dont want to say anything because their embarssed they'll get joked on, peopke shouldn't be scared to work out, run, or just exercise in general in front of people, it's all personal refrence. I you dont want to work out they just need someone to push them, so they know that they have reason to get in shape.

Students that play for the school need it to. People are so tired of doing work and having such a long day at school dont feel like going to practice right after school.

Therefore I like the way things are if we had activities around the school.
