I agree with the driverless cars. I think it is an awesome thing to create and I also think it will keep those focused and alert because maybe they don't know what the car is capable of and is scared something bad will appear

But again on my other side i'm thinking that people will take adavantage of this opportunity and will be on their phones or with their buddies in the car doing something they should'nt be doing.

There is nothing wrong with having to help your car out. The driverless car is not as smart as you are and so therefore you will have to help. Do not get a driverless car in the future if you want it to drive you 100% of the time. Driverless cars is an option and an opportunity for the world to see something different and to prove others. You will have to be the "Traffic Jam Assistant" but theres nothing wrong with that, the driverless car will be cotrolling everything else. You really have nothing to worry about but always stay alert.

I definanlty agree with the driverless cars. It's an great oppourtunity. For the world and the better life itself.
