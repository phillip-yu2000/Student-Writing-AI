Throughout the years, the human race has evolved, and developed new forms of technology. We've managed to create and discover many great things, such as discovering fire, electricty, finding the cure for terrible diseases, and we must admit that all these things have changed our lives completely, whether it's in a bad, or in a good way.

We have now recently created a software, that allows computers to recognize our emotions, all by reading our facial expressions. They are now debating if they should include the software in school computers, this way the software would know whether the student is enjoying, struggling or getting confused by the lesson, which is exactly what they would need to know in order to modify the lesson. I personally believe that it would be a great idea to allow schools to have acces to this software, it would be a great help, since for many students, verbal communication is just not their thing. "Most human communictaion is nonverbal, including emotional commmunication," notes Dr. Huang, sometimes it isn't easy to open up to people, especially teachers. Most students fear that teachers are going to yell at them or judge them instead of helping them out, and unfotunately this type of situations still happen in our school. Everyone deserves a chance to be heard or understood, even those who dont have the ability, or simply don't feel comfortable communicating verbally with others, this shouldn't even be up for debate.
