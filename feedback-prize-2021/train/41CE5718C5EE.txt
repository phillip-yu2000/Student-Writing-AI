Why is the planet Venus called Venus though? This story explains how the solar system is used. I think challenge of exploring Venus is a great story explaining how it's a safe envoirment, and the solar is very powerfull.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy puruit despite the dangers is in paragraphs one, three,and five. In paragraph one it saids " While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to exmine more closely " saying that the author explains how Venus is a worthy danger. In paragraph three it states that " Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet." this talks about how danger is a priority now dealing with the temperatures. It also saids " Venus has th hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun." This was talking about how the author explains the facts of our solar system. In paragraph five it states " Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." This was talking about Solar power concern and how the author supports the idea of the whole Venus solar system.

In conculsion i think the author supports the idea of studying Venus is worthy and how it's very important to our solar system.
