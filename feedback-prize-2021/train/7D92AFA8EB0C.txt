Have you ever wanted to do something, but wasn't sure if it was the right decision? Well, sometimes it's good to get another person's opinion on the matter, and it's even better to get multiple opinions. It is good to see what the majority thinks, and if you're completely lost, it's good to have choices. Most importantly of course, is the fact that they may give you some helpful advice!

First off, It's good to see what the majority thinks about your issue. For example, it's Saturday and you have a project due Friday of next week. You want to take time on the weekend to relax, but you don't want to procrastinate. So you ask your friends and other people you know what to do. If the majority says do the project, you should probably do it. The majority decision is usually the best way to go.

Secondly, If you have no clue what to do, it is good to have some direction. Nobody likes being completely lost, so it is good to have a plan. But if you can't come up with one, then you're going to need some help. It's good to work with a group because you all have ideas that you can follow. Work together, and you can all come up with a good plan.

Lastly-and the most obvious- you can get other people's advice. Having a hard time deciding what to get for lunch? Ask all of your friends! If you have tough project that's due in three days, ask someone for design ideas. It is extremely helpful and will make youre life a thousand times easier!

In conclusion, asking for multiple opinions is extremely helpful. The majority decision is usually the best and having direction can help eliminate confusion. Lastly, you can get tons of helpful advice that will save you lots of head scratching! You can make better decisions in life if you have a direction to follow, and that's probably why we ask questions. Always remember to ask questions, because you may end up making better decisions.Â
