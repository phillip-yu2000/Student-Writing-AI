The author suggetsts that studying the harsh planet of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. However, the author does not provide ENOUGH information to be convincing. In paragraph 7, it states that "simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions" this shows some insightful information, but there should also testing of more complicated and complex electronics and equipment. Another method the author claims is using a mechanical computer to handle the conditions. It's a good method, but it doesn't support HOW it can be used on Venus. The last method is using a blimp/plane-like aircraft to monitor Venus. It's a great method to study more about the atmosphere, but as it states "reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas , or anything else, from a distance" hindering the option of a thorough mission. The author has some great claims, but needs to go more in-depth as to what some of the mentioned methods will do and how they will potentially work on Venus.
