There's a bunch of controversy over the driverless cars. Some people hink that they are a good idea and some people don't. Many people have their opinions on this topic. Now it's time for me to tell you mine.

In my opinion I think that driverless cars would be a good idea. Driverless cars would help out a lot. Like in the first paragraph in the passage it said that the cars would use half the fuel that taxis use, and it would offer more flexibility then a bus. Just imagine having a car like that. Yeah the car would have its flaws, but that would be an amazing thing to have. Also imagine having a car with no driver. Yeah it sounds scary, but it would be cool. The only major bad thing about having one would be having to worry about serious accidents that might happen.

That's why I think that driverless cars would be cool to have. There are good and bad things about having driverless cars, but I mean there's good and bad things about everything, You have to have an open mind to new things. Driverless cars could help out with so many things. Don't just focus on the negative things. You have to look at the poditive side of this.
