Principal,

I have been informed that you would like to make it mandatory for all students to help with community work. From my point of view that would not be a good idea. You should not make community service mandatory, but advise it for all students to do. You could also give them something back for helping with community service. Forcing students to do something that they do not want to do could be extremely bad for their health.

Most children have things that they and do not want to do. If you make them something that they do not want to do then it can be physically or mentally bad for them. In some cases little children can take being forced into trying something new as a negative reaction. Therefore it might give them the idea that doing something new is bad. On the other hand it could cause them physical damage. Some children have very fragile bones or extreme allergies. In that case they could brake a bone or not be able to breath.

In the end you should advise helping with community service because most kids do not want to be pushed into doing something that they do not want to do. If you advise it then more kids might want to do it because they have the chose on weather to help or not. You could also say that if you help out with the community service that you can have a higher grade in your lowest class or that they would get Beta Club points for helping out. i know when

I am pushed into doing something that I do not want to do, I usually will never do it again because I saw it as a bad experience or a punishment for doing something bad.

Therefore when children are forced to do something that they do not want to then that could leave them with emotional or physical scars. If you know what is best for your students then you should take into consideration into what I have talked to you about. That would be the better chose for both you and your students.

Thank You,
