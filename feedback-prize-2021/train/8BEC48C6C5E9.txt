The students may have trouble with work at home so their grades might be a little low, but if we had more time to work on it in class and we had it explained to us clearly we might understand it more. I think the school policy should not be changed to we have to have a B grade average to play sports most kids have trouble once in a while, but we just need more help then we get now. Students just need to be passing to play sports and have fun another way to get kids to work better, and harder is to reward them with a game or a treat.

If kids don't get to play sports or games they might not work even hard enough to get a c' s it would be d' s and f' s if the students get privileges they will work harder. What the school could do is set up events for all the students to do for a limited amount of time a day like 30 minuets before lunch. The teachers can just take more time on each lesson to make sure every one knows what to do.

Events can be used as an activity and a free time thing to do, but if students decide to play sports Instead of have the activity they can get a few friends and go play the sport of their choosing. It will be good to use to get students attention and to buckle down in school, and do their work so they can get rewarded. If they have work for a class they can go into their teachers class to get their work done and then they should be able to go play if they did not get in trouble all week.

every student deserves one chance to improve on there grades and to stay out of trouble. even the good kids mess up sometimes so all the students need to get a second chance.
