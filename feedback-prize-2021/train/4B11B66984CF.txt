dear TEACHER_NAME

we think we all should be allowed to bring your phone to school and use them during a lunch periods but as long as the phone is off or we should be able to use the phone to because it might be an emergency for us too. you just never know when something could appear to happen. and the teachers should do the same thing so it would be the same amount and it would be fair to both of us to students and teachers. so we wont be bored either for example if we are done with an assignment or maybe we should do are work at the same time while we are using are phone. and plus middle school students like to chat with their friends and every body likes to text the most cause middle school students think that we are adults now and we should be trusted to use are phone in middle school all the time. because we are almost there to being an adult. but for now we are young adults. we should be starting to be using are phone so we can get ready for high school. so that way we will become smart and we will really become into real adults.
