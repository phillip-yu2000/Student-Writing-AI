Dear TEACHER_NAME

Changing school policy is a big change for a school and changing it for the wrong reason can make it worse. I clearly state my opinion saying I do not support this decision, if a student doesn't make at least a B average in school doesn't mean he/she shouldn't participate in sports for the school. But i strongly agree that students have to pass at least two or more academic classes.

Making a C average isn't all that bad, as long as your passing you should be able to play sports. for example i have a friend named RELATIVE_NAME, RELATIVE_NAME's a good football player and a great basketball player too but he isn't all that great in class. RELATIVE_NAME is currently failing two classes out of his 4 academic class which would be Math, Language Arts, Social Studies and Science. His good, and the team needs him to bring home a championship this year for football like he did last year. but he cant play at the championship game we have next week Friday . all because of his grades.

something like that wouldn't help the school in sports. so RELATIVE_NAME decided to try and bring up his grade so he can play in the game. which would mean staying after school for extra help and coming in early in the morning for tutoring. He wasn't really a smart guy so he failed to bring up his grade and ended up not playing in the final game of his middle school year.

RELATIVE_NAME got so mad and angry that he didn't even want to do anything anymore, he dropped out of school and got hooked on drugs all because of one game of his final year in middle school.

So that decision of making students getting a B average inst really a good idea. because people's career can end and there are so many talented players in this school who can make this school proud of him and make them look back and say "Oh that was a great kid" so passing your class shouldn't be all that utter.

I hope my decision is taking into action.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
