The Face on mars is just a natural landform. any scientist believe it was created by aliens, but i feel like its just a normal landform. To prove that it is a natural landform and not built by position of mars,

erosion, and time change.

The position of the planet can also be the reason why the rock looks like a face. In paragraph 2, it says that the rock did have shadoes that could give anillusion of eyes, mouth, and a nose. In paragraph 8, It gives the season which caused clouds. Clouds are one of many reasons that causes shadows. These clouds could of ben in a cerrtain position that gave "The Face" illusions.

A possible explanation that the face is just a natural landform is erosion. In paragraph 8, it states that . Mars experienced a vey cloudy time. As known that clouds can form rain and/or wind which can be used to wither ddown rocks. Wind on Mars could be harsh and putting a lot of pressure aganst a giant rock causeing it to make indents. These indents can be seen as eyes, mouth, or even a nose.

As you see in the pictures that were taken by Viking 1, over the time period the face began to dissapear. In the pre-story,

"The Face" was hand made by an alien then wouldn't you think that they would keep itin good condition . Instead "The Face"

deformed over the time. Just like on earth, rocks break down over time.

There are many factors that can be said to prove that "The Face" is just a natural landform.

Even an website like the one in paragraph 7, can state that it was just a nateral landform. With enough evidence you can prove that it was indeed a natural landform.
