Venus, the sister planet to Earth. When considered for exploration, there are many different reasons for or against exploration. Among the agaist exploration reasons are the immenent danger and hostile atmosphere. But with new research and development of technology, slowly we are getting to the point of being able to possibly reduce the risks of a failed mission. The author of " The challenge of Exploring Venus" agrees about the rewards of exploring Venus.

There is a fair bit of evidence to support the exploration of Venus, chief among them the proximity to Earth, reducing the amount of time needed to arrive on Venus if we time a launch correcty. The other reason is that there is new research into old technology from the early 1900's to World War II, known as mechanical computers. These machines are simpler than you think though. All they are is a bunch of gears and levers and don't require electricity at all. Considering Venus's hostile conditions, this approach seems well guided in the thought of repurposing and reusing these ancient machines.

All things considered, if these new developments are sucessful, and the timing is right, than we could possibly hear an announcement about a manned mission to Venus. Most likely not tommorrow, but it is possible in our lifetime to hear about this. The author supports the claim of possible exploration, and therefore with newfound evidence and reason, so do I.
