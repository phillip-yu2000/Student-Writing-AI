Should emotions come in the way of teaching? Some may feel uncomfortable, and some may think its nessasary.

With teenagers now a days emotions are very unpredictable.

There is many things to take thought into before introducing this 'Facial Action Coding System' in schools.

Teenagers go through many emotions during the day. In one hour they may feel tired, sad, mad, or even discusted. But then the next hour they may feel happy, excited, or surprised. The point is that students' emotions are very unpredictable. Yet I feel like these emotions should not get in the way of teaching.

Another thing that is very important to point out is that this approach might make students feel uncomfortable or even exposed. Privacy can be very important for some students. School is supposed to be a place where students can come and learn not have to worry about their emotions. That shouldn't be an excuse. Not all students have the same emotions, to make a plan that goes with every students' emotions is close to impossible.

However, teachers may find this approach helpful. They would know if the students are bored and they might be able to go about their lesson a different way. This would help to get the attention of the students and to keep them entertained. This approach would make it easier for teachers to connect with their students too.

Overall, having this approach in school in my opinion, isn't nessasary. Of course it could be helpful to get students more engaged in their learning, but this approach could also make students feel uncomfortable. It'll be very difficult to come up with a lesson to work with every emotion in a classroom full of develpoing kids.
