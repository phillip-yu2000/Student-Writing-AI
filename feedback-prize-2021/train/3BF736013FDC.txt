Dear state senator,

Changing the vote from voting for a slate of electors to popular vote would be reasonable. I think that having to vote for a slate of electors is pretty hard knowing that you're basically just voting for people that's with one president or another president. Popular vote is a good idea because you can get a bit more accuracy from the votes.

Electorial college has 34 electors who "Can be anyone not holding office" also voters can get confused about who they're voting for. "Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electorial vote." If there was a tie, it would have to be "thrown to the House Of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president." We really dont want the House Of Representatives solving a tie for us. Unlike the popular vote where there is re-counts, the electorial college has none of that. If its a tie it gets passed on to another group.

Popular votes are more ideal because you actually have a chance of the person you voted for actually becoming president. If there's a tie, re-counts are established. Popular votes also don't have "disaster factors". This also has a less chance of a dispute erupting like it did in 2000 with the electorial vote. With popular vote, you are guaranteed that you know who you're voting for and you don't have the possible chance that you've just voted for the guy you highly dislike. Popular votes had also won the election for President Barack Obama. Where if it were electorial college, it would have taken a long time for the winner of the vote is announced.
