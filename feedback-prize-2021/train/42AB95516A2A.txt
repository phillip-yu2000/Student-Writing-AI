Dear state senator, i just want to inform you on a few things about in favor of keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we as a natioin should keep the Electoral College. We should keep it because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed and because the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal.

We should keep the Electoral College because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. It is entirely possible that the winner of eletoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000 when Gore had more  popular votes than bush. Yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region...south, northeast, etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is likely to be successful president.

Therefore us as a nation should keep the way we do things. We should keep the Eletororal College because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. Another thing is that the eletoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal.
