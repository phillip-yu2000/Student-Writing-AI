Cars are an integrated part of our society, but they are becoming less and less popular as the years progress.  There are many advantages to limited use of cars.  By restricting or eliminating the use of cars, the world would be a greener, safer place.

First and foremost is the fact that green house gas emissions could be cut by up to fifty percent in places like the United States. According to Robert Duffer, after restricting driving in Paris, the French city saw the sky clear after just a few days.  Elizabeth Rosenthal and Andrew Selsky agree that the reduction of car usage would result in a significant decrease in smog and carbon emissions.

The most significant effect, however, would be the safety of cyclists, joggers, and children playing in the street.  Every parent worries about their child being hit by a careless driver, so reducing the usage of cars would make car accidents virtually nonexistant.  Elizabeth Rosenthalsays that in Vauban, the "swish of bicycle chains and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional motor."  It sounds like heaven, but really it is only a group of people that are dedicated to a safer, greener world.

Finally we have a world full of conveniences for us, but if we continue to treat it this way, it won't survive much longer.  The Earth won't be around forever, but we should do everything we can to prolong its life.  By limiting car usage, we can make the world a safer place for everyone, as well as a healty, beautiful place to live.
