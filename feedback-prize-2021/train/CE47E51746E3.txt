All of our development since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change. Do you know what are some of the risks of car-intesive areas? Well, passenger cars are the responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... And up to 50 percent in some car-intesive areas in the United States.

There's many ways to reduce car pollution, for example as is said in Source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France (Paris) after days of near-record polllution because Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. but Pasris isn't is the only one who's making a change, as it shows in Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Bogota has given a new beginning with the implementation of a program "The day without cars" in which cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for. In both cities the weather spread out in good changes and reduce drastically car pollution.

But, why is limited car usage important? Well, there is many reasons to get benefits beause of it, for instance, suburbs are becoming more compact and more accessible to public transportation, also in this new aproach, stores are placed a walk away, on main streets, rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Therefore, pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources,lower emissions and improve safety, so remember driving is a vanity not a priority.
