In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He explains and shows the dangers Venus has to offer and how scientists and are fascinated in trying to overcome these obstacles without any casualties.

The dangers of Venus has made it difficult for missions to succeed in previous explorations. In paragraph 2 it states,"...since no spacecraft survived the landing for more han a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why no a single spaceship has touched down on Venus.." Venus's dangerous climate makes it difficult in this way. In paragraph 3 it states,"Venus has the hottest surface tamperature of any planet in our solar system,.." With these obstacles Venus provides, scientists are trying to overcome these obstacles to explore the similar features that we see on Earth today. In paragraph 5 it states,"...(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans ro study Venus...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way." Another way they are trying to avoid casualies are by using silicon carbide. In paragraph 7 it says,"...electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface...lasted for three weeks in such conditions."

With these support claims by the author, it provides an idea to go into pursuit despite the dangers that Venus throws at us. Explaining the experiments and ideas planned to take on Venus, gives a more positive outlook on exploring our sister planet.
