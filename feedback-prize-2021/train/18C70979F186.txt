Do you think driverless cars are really necessary? Car manufactures and Google are trying to create cars that are fully operational by themselves. They would require no driver and operate based on computer technology, sensors, and self operating mechanisms. But would this be a good idea? Would it require changes to everyday life? What if the technology that goes into one of these cars fail?

I do not think driverless cars should be manufactured. It would rquire several changes including laws. Acording to the article Driverless Cars Are Coming, "traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times." As a result of this laws would need to be changed if driverless cars were mass produced. The article also states "California, Nevada, Flordia, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars." Driverless cars could also lead to conflict over the owner of a driverless car and the producer. The article states, "if technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver of the manufacture?"

Cars should continue to be manufactured how they are. Adding more safety mechanisms would be better but allowing the car driverless would be dangerous. Laws and regulations should remain how they are without changes from a driverless car.
