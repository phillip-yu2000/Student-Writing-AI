Dear, Principal everyone should do community service because its good for the community. Everyone should step in and make things happen even if doing community service takes up your time you should still do it. Doing community service takes up time but when you are doing it for a good thing it doesn't matter. The communities would be better if everyone just did a little for it. In the passage the elementary students are doing a good thing because they are kids that want to help the community. The kids that need more time are "The cool kids" they have everyday to do something and if they would realize that 1 hour of their time doing work isn't so bad. Your community can be a better place and environment. So please help the community better and make things better for yourself. Taking the day to do something to help something is something i would want to do everyone should want to do community service. If you help, the next day you can feel great about what you did. In the end it will make you smarter and kind and respectful. So yes everyone should do community service and help. I hope you realize now what helping the community is all about.
