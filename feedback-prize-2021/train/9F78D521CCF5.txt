Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

This letter is concerning your idea of a school policy of no sports or other activities unless you have a grade average of a B or higher. My view on this possible policy change is that it shouldn't happen. Many students have a C average and their only outlet is sports. Without being able to participate in sports they are going to turn to other things, and it's not going to be homework.

Sports play a vital role in student's lives whether they have an A average, a B average, or a C average. Grades are very important but so are sports. Kids my fellow students still need to be active no matter what. Without sports to do kids who are having problems at home or problems with their grades use sports as an outlet. It is something they can enjoy doing and helps them feel better. Why would you want to take that away from them?

Without sports students are going to start turning to something else. Drugs. Without sports as their outlet they need a new one and they are going to start hanging around the wrong kids. They are going to start slowly killing themselves from the use of cigarettes and other drugs. Do you want that happening?

You are the one who is always saying "Stay active" "Don't do drugs". By enforcing this new policy you are basically encouraging the opposite of those phrases. The kids who have a C average aren't going to be able to do sports and will find drugs as another outlet. So instead of trying to make things better by encouraging people to get their grades up so that they can do sports, your creating the opposite effect and making things much worse.

I strongly advise that you do not go forward with this policy because it is going to backfire very badly. I don't know about you but i do not want our school to be known as the drug school who doesn't support everyone getting active. That's not the title that SCHOOL_NAME deserves, but it will be if you enforce this new policy.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
