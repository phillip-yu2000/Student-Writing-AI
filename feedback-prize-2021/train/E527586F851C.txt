Having a device near you while driving is very dangerous and a huge distraction. There are many consequences if you get caught driving with a cell phone. It distracts you from paying attention to your surroundings and you could hurt yourself or others around you. It is also against the law.

The U.S department of transportation reported that cell phones are involved in 1.6 million vehicle crashes each year. It has caused half a million injuries and around 6000 deaths annually. Texting while driving is even more dangerous than driving while under the influence of alcohol. People should put their devices down and focus on the roads and surrounding cars.

Everyday around 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving. It only takes 3 seconds for a crash to occur after a driver becomes distracted by their cell phone or anything else. Holding a device while driving slows their reaction time by 49%. Car wrecks have killed nearly 32,999 people yearly and injuring around 2,239,000 people.

As of July 1,2018, in Georgia the "hands free law" was passed. The "hands free law" means that drivers will no longer be allowed to have a phone in their hand or supported by any part of their body. Texting while driving is highly illegal and it's good to see the state's law being put in to action.

We should not text and drive. It is overall a distraction and could lead you to death or you could kill an innocent person. The laws are very strict about texting and driving now. It's good to see the cops pushing the law so hard on people and if you don't listen then you suffer the consequences.
