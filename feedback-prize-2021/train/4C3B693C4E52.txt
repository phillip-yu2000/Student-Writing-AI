I am going against the school policy change about the sports grade participate because if most students have a grade C then many students will not be in the sports or other activities as much. Therefore, there would be no point of even having those clubs if like only a couple students will be in them. Plus, the grade C is at least passing, the grades D and F are not, making a reasonable statement why F and D students should not participate. There is not a very good reason why C students should not join, it is still passing plus the fact that most students have a C. If you allow grade C and up, the club/activities will have more students to join, if you do not have the grade C students, it will not be like a club.

For example, if only 5 people join for Basketball, then there really is not any point at all to go against another school's team who has 10 people, making no point to even join the club. If you add in the C students, for example, the Basketball teams will be even and the students will actually be able to go against another team, making it 10 students against 10 students. All in all, if you add the grade C students, there will be a even enough team, plus a opportunity to get active and encourage students to follow their dreams of being , for example, a football player, a Basketball player, or even want to be in the Olympics. If you do not add the grade C students, it will be like taking away their Lifetime wish/dream, which is not a very helpful thing to do as a principal.
