25 years ago "The Face" happend on Mars. Some people say The Face on Mars came from aliens, the face is a very known figure , that NASA discovered. It was found out that there was no aliens that created this object, but came natural.

In fact on Apirl 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, after the Viking discovered the face over 22 years ago on 1976, Michael Milan and His Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a photo ten times sharper than the oringial Viking photos , witch revelaved a natural landform, as said by the Mars Global Surveyor team.

Some people were not convinced that the face was a natural landform , due to there being haze, winds and also a cloudy time to see the face through the camera, there were conspriacy theorists that said "Perhaps skeptic and alien markings were hidden by the haze."

But then on April 8 , 2001 almost 3 years later - a cloudless summer day, Mars Global Surveyor drew close to the "Face on Mars" they had to "roll 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view" said Gravin. Malins team captured a extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution, each pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo to finally prove that "The Face on Mars" is a natural landform, Still to this day there are conspiracy theorist who believe that "The Face on Mars" was not a natrual making!
