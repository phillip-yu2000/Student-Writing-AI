There are many reasons why i agree with this answer such as, students usually go home eat and go to sleep, but if thy were doing and after school activity they will keep learning and stay active, Another reason is if the child is obese or over weight they could use the extracurricular activity a away of losing weight and getting in shape. The last reason is if students have trouble n school they could use an activity to help them catch up and bring up there grades.

Imagine if a student loved to play a sport but couldnt afford it they could do and extracurricular activity and play a sport and enjoy it with out breaking there parents bank. What if a students parent could not pick there child up from school because of a job, the student could do any extracurricular activity to kill time. There are many reasons why students need to do after school activities i could keep them out of trouble, it could help them lose weight, it could help them to kill time and there is many more reasons why i think it will be could for any student. If student could sign up for and extracurricular activity and it helps them improve in the class room why not do it. What if theres a new kids he could do and activity and find new friends and friends that are interested in the same hobby as them. I agree with is because it can help improve in the classroom and can open new interest for student and find new friends and maybe it could help them find a career for themselves one day.

If a student did and extracurricular activity it could help them learn life skills so when they go in to the real world they can take things they learned and put it to good use. Right there i told you so many reasons why you should take and extracurricular activity so if you are in school and need help in school or want to play a sport just do and extracurricular activity it could open many new worlds for you and could help you in many ways.
