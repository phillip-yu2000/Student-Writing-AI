Did you know not haveing a car can make you happier. In Vauban,Gremany it costs 40,000 dollars for your home and garage. Because of this 70 percent of the population does not own a car and 57 precent of that sold there car to live there. Many of there residents say there much happier without a car. One offical named Heidrun Walter explained how "When i had my car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way" and its true driving makes you stressed.

Not only not have a car makes you happy but it also can save the ecosystem. Green house gas is a big problem in the world now. Carbon dioxide slowly filling are planet. Acts like Vauban, and others like it, can influnce the world to change from the dangeruos road that we desided to take. But Europe produces 12 precent of green house gas, America on the other hand produces 50 precent of green house gas. America needs to change or we all die off.

Paris has more smog then any other European capitals. Come on if you don't think thats terrable then you need a new mind set because this is evolving into a problem. They say that diesel fual is to blame. because 67 precent of Paris has diesel fuel. I think its because theres, I dont know, A billion people driving at the same time.

This concludes that we need to stop using automobiles. Because its killing are eco system and we can do it . Many small cities are doing it and there happy. So why do we have to be mad and lazy when we can be happy and active.
