Dear Principal,

I, as a student of your school disagree with having students need to have at least a grade B average.

This is because it is unfair for students who are at the moment holding on to their passing grade in school.

I think that students should be able to play sports and other activities unless they have a C average because having a C average is still a passing grade, and most students in our school already have a grade C average, and playing sports keeps kids healthy and it exercises their brains for better school work.

Students should be able to still play sports with a grade C average.

This is because a C average is still a passing grade in school.

It's unfair to have to have a grade higher than passing so that you can play sports and have fun.

If the school's policy changed, than even students in other activities that exercise the brain will not be able to participate.

It would be very unfair to change the school's policy now because most students in our school at the moment have a grade C average.

Students in our school would drop out and go to other schools and other students will be dissatisfied with our school.

Students would less happy on campus and completely change.

Others will vandalize the school out of disrespect.

The last reason that students should be able to play sports with a grade C average is because playing sports keeps students healthy and doing better in school.

This will get smarter students graduating from our school and students producing better pieces of work.

Playing sports exercises student's brains and will eventually get them that grade B average.

Students should be able to play sports with a grade C average because a C average is already a passing grade, most students in our school have a C average, and playing sports keeps kid
