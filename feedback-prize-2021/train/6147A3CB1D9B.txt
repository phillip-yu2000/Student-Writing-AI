Yes, i think that using this technology could be very useful for almost all grade levels in schools.

I get bored, zone out, and even just stop caring about a lesson in school, simply because i am just bored.

If this new software does what it said it can do and will do in the article then this is a huge technelogical advancment for our education and learning.

All kids learn in different ways and have different ways that they see things.

If the new software can personolize the learning of every student then schools wouldnt have problems with kids because they want to learn, grades and test scores would go up, and less trouble would be happening in a school.

If Dr. Huang and his colleagues can develop this emotion software and emotion science even more then the world could have a bright future ahead.

A lot of smarter generations are coming through.

But it would have to be mastered first because everyone has a different face and everyone reacts differently.

So i feel like it would be quite a task to get every single emotion down to see how a particular person is feeling.
