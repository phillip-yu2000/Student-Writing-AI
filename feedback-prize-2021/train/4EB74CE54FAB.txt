You´re in chemistry and you have no idea what the teacher it talking about. This is the third time this week going over chemical equations and the fact that you still don´t understand it, is embarassing. So you don´t ask for help. What if the teacher knew based soley on your facial expressions? Using the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would be valuable to students who are unconfident in asking questions and to students who really care about their education.

Well known, some students struggle with verbal communication. They are shy, socially underdeveloped, or just uncomfortable with holding a conversation. If there was a device like the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in classrooms, it would help teachers know who understands and who doesn´t. Who still needs help and who doesn´t. This could be the difference between passing or failing.

Students go through a lot with life-changing tests, and pressures to be successful in life. With the FACS, teachers will be able to sense when a student is unwilling or not trying; teachers will know to not waste valuable time on them. These types of attitudes are contagious especially in a classroom. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, we unconciously imitate eachother´s facial expressions and moods. This means other students won´t want to learn either.

In conclusion, having the FACS in classrooms would be helpful to students and educators. Some teachers lack patience while some students lack confidence. Having a device that could sort all that out and make room for real learning, would be grand.
