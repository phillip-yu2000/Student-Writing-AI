The principal wants to enforce a rule for every student to stay after school and do at least one extracurricular activity. Here is why I disagree.

I think the school shouldn't enforce a rule for the students to do extracurricular activities because students may have things to do after school. Instead, the principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students who want to stay after school.

I disagree with the principal's idea because students may have many things to do after school. For example, students may have to babysit their siblings, do sports, or simply have lots of homework to do when they get home. The principal enforcing a rule on the students making them do at least one activity makes it so that students don't have time to do what they need to do when they come home.

The principal should make a non-mandatory after school program for the students that don't have out of school activities. For example, Student help, clubs, or sport related activities. That way, students don't feel like it's a mandatory extra 2 hours of school but instead, it's an optional way of taking part in school activities.

In conclusion, the principal should not enforce the rule of making them stay after school because the kids may have to do out of school activties. But instead, having an option of letting students stay after school if they like to.
