In the article unmasking the face on Mars NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face.

It was an enorumous head nearly two miled from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet calle Cydonia.

I dont think the face was real in the first place because the face is really blurry and its half in the ground.

NASA knew it wasent real when they unvelied the image for all to see.

The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

"But the sensation was short lived."

"Scientists figured it was just another Martian messa, common enough around Cydonia,only this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The "Face on Mars" has since become a pop icon.

It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around american west.
