There is way to forget all of the school work and do something a lot more funnier during the day its called doing an extracurricular. For example, you had a very boring day in all of your class's ,and having that extracurricular like a sport could set you in a different mood. I strongly agree having an extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's a good use of free time away from the school work, future careers ,and it would be fun for the students.

An extracurricular is a great way to get away from school stress. There are some days students have to do nothing but sit down and write for the whole day. Research says that doing this same cycle everyday will not help students intake information the right way. Having this extracurricular is also a lot like having your brain rest to better process that information.

A extracurricular would be great for students looking for more experience for future careers. like joining the student council or doing a sport. For example joining the students council is like taking ownership of a job ,and doing a sport like football, soccer and wrestling start to get young athletes to get a lot better. An extracurricular can be very helpful in the long run.

Having a extracurricular would be a lot of fun for students picking what they wanna do. Like some students that have a heart for sports or if other students want more of a challenge joining the student council may be fun for them. Research says that when your're a lot more happy you are more awake and ready to learn. If all the students did an extra curricular it would for a fact brighten their moods.

In conclusion, having a extracurricular is a good idea for the students. It's fun and it would get more students to wanna do it. Its a good use for free time and to take a break from school work. Helps out a lot of students for the real world.
