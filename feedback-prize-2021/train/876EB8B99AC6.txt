There is always that one specific person we like going to talk to about a situation or problems that we go through or that we have. We love hearing what their point of view on things, because we don't always have good advice for ourselves and thats why we seek to find help from a specific person that we trust and you clearly don't wanna leave the situation, it's better to fix the problem then to have it in your mind and worry about it and then regret that you never even tried to fix the problem or seek help for it and get something good out of it.

Theres never the perfect advice, you could ask the smartest person in the world and i guarentee you that they will NOT have the perfect advice and maybe even sometimes that specific person that you talk to about your problems wont have the solution to the probelm so, its better to reach out to multiple people that you know and hear there point of view or what they have to say about the situation.

When you hear the advice that want to hear from someone use that advice or in other words try it out and if it doesn't help the situation try other advices that people gave you because not only did you get one person to give you advice but you got multiple people to help you out and give you advice and now you have multiple advices to try out and see which one brings you a solution.
