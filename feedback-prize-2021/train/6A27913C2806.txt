The new system of reading students emotionals is very important but It might be difficult to read someone's emotional because first of all, people are very different and it is not simple to directly see or know someone's emotionals. But at some point it's easy to a teacher recognize if his/her student are very confused or bored of something that's hard to get done with them(students).

" The Mona Lisa demonstrations is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that shows when you're happy or sad. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive and most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication". There are some people that can't show their emotional out of other because they don't want their feelings or emotionals to be known and those kind of people are probably the ones who needs the new technology system to be finding out if they are happy, sad, frustrated or every kind emotionals because they can probably cause a lot of damage in most places all around the world.
