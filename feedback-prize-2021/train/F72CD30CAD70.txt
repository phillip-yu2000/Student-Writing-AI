Dear Principle,

I think either of your policies are just fine, but to not make students not get into trouble I think your first policy of letting them use their phones at lunch times and free times is just great and also to have them turned off while they are in class. I mean if students get to use their phones lets say at least two periods a day, they'll be just fine and won't really have the urge to use it in class. The reason why I am saying this is because, example me if my school had a policy like that I would barley take out my phone in class and start using it while the teacher is teaching. I rather have that policy than the second policy of not allowing students to bring phones to school at all because there is more chance that students will use their phones in class. Using phones in lunch is no problem because it's not education , it's time to eat and or talk to friends. Lunch periods are considered more like to be a free period and that is where students should and would have the more the urge to use their phones.

Students should not have a reason to use their phones in class and especially if they have that policy of using it on lunch times and free time. If students do break the rule of using it in class than your job as a principle would be to take that privilege away from them and then there would be no phones allowed in school. I think students should really take advantage of this because I would know every student would want to use their phone like to text a friend or something. Every student deserves to have fun while using their phones and so this would able to happen ONLY

in lunch periods or their free time. Not in class because class is for learning and every student needs their education for a better future. I hope you agree with my position and let your students have the privilege to use their phones while in school but not in class.

Yours truly,
