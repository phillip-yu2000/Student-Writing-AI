I think the use of techology than can read the emotional expressions of students in classroom is valuable. Technology would be able to make see and predict more student's emotions. Knowing the emotions of students would allow changes to be made in the teaching of individual students. With technology, classrooms would be more effiecient, have better test scores and grades and would allow for a better development in education.

Using technology would help teachers see what method of teaching would be best for their classroom, based on feedback given from technology. If teachers would use technology in the classroom, they could make changes in the way they teach their students, allowing better efficiency in the classroom. With better efficiency less time could be spent learning and more strengthening of what students know.

Technology would also help classrooms have better grades and do better on tests. This would be possible by seeing the students that are bored or confused. With students that are learning better and understanding more, their grades are sure to increase, as well as their test scores.

Technology would also help better develop education. With feedback from technology and a change in teaching styles, education as a whole could be changed. The change would consist of a better ability to teach students in the time they get with the teacher. And a better understanding in students of what they learned.

Technology to read emotional expressions in classrooms would be valuable. Classrooms would have better grades and test scores, be more efficient and allow for a development in education. Technology used in classrooms could also help scientists better develop uses for technology in other parts of life. Classrooms would better as a whole.
