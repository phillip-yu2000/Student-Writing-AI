Dear principal,

I think that helping in community service is a great idea. I think that you should ask the students first if they would like to participate in community service and the ones that do could sign up for it. You could explain to them how it can help you in the future. . Tell them the different ways with helping your community, they can clean up a park, recycle things, donate different kind of stuff, helping out at a nursing home and many other ways.

Some may not want to because they might think it takes to much time. But if they decide to help ,they can do it! Explain how It will help you become a better person, you will get to help others and that will make you feel good about yourself. Tell them that its a fun thing to do its better than just staying home and do nothing or just hangout with friends when you could do that another day. Convince them to do community service they won't regret it.
