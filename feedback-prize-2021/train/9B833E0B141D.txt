Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. The yearly car accidents that happen every year is 1.6 million cars a year.

Not only does texting and driving puts your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to mention pedestrians who often end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers.
