Not A Face

The Face on Mars is just a natural landform, although some people believe that the Face is bona fide edvidence of life on mars I can insure you its not. I can give three good reasons why I am insisting that this sculpture is just a rock. First of all we had a better camera when we went back to investigate. Second of all we double cheaked our reasch. And third of all both results proved that it indeed was just a landform, much like Americas.

In

1998 we send a special team called the MOC to investigate the Face. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photos back in 1976. These photos came back stating that it was a natural land form. But not everyone was satisfied. At that time the MOC had took the photo it was winter in April '98 on the planet- a cloudy time of the year on mars. The camera might have been fogged.

Two prove ower statement in 2001 we sent the MOC to take a second photo of the Face this time during the planets summer and with an even better camera. This newer camera had higher definition than the other two. When results came back they, again, stated a natural land mark.

As you can see not only did we cheak once but twice both supporting NASA'S claim that "the Face of Mars" was just a rock after all.
