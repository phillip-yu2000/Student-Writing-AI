I belive that if they make a driverless car thier would be a huge impact in the whole world because of the fact that you would not have to drive the car it's driveing its self. The google car can drive to a certain standard and how fast it would go driveing by its self. The maping in the car can be very profiencent. The google car can drive to a certain standard. The most that the car has gone is 25 mph driveing by its self. Google started this project since 2009 so time by time thier investing into this car to make it more proficent every time they invest to the car. They make the computer more better so thier would be less accidents while being in the google car. They had made more improvements in the cars sensor so the car can be more safer. The google car has antilock brakes. The google car is more proficent then a taxi dirver and the gas last more. In 2013 BMW had annouced the had made a " traffic jam assistant". Nisan and Audi had plans to have a driverless car by 2020 not very long. But we are getting closer and closer every day seeing the future in our own eyes. The dirverless car will help people who do not have that much money to be in a get a safe ride.

In somes states its llegal to have a driverless car. The cars have been proved to be more safe then any regular car.
