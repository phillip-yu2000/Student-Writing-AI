It is my belief that the author has done a good job of suporting his claim that we should study Venus even with the present dangers. From the article I read I have three pieces of evidence from the text that will now support my claim.

In the first paragraph, lines 1-2, it is stated that Venus is oftencalled Earth's twin. this would be a major reason to study it, so we know what to do with it if we need to use it. It was also said in the same paragraph and lines that Earth is the same Density and Size of Earth, therefore it would be a good planet to study so we can learn more about planets that share sizes.

Another piece of evidence I have from the text is from paragraph 4, lines 3-5, "...It [Venus] may well once have been the most Earth-like planet on out solar system." That would be a major reason to study this planet, later in that paragraph it goes on to say how it may have had been covered in oceans and wildlife like Eath. Why wouldn't we study it.

That is why I belive the author did an excellent job of supporting his own claim that we should be studying Venus.
