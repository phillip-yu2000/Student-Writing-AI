Dear, Principle

I think we that the grade average should stay at a C average because many people can only do C work and not a lot of people can get B' s. Also most people that do play sports might think that education doesn't matter that its all about sports and so they are able to keep playing sports they do their work at an average which is a C and people do drop out of sports because it is already hard for them to get C' s or better so if you ask me i think that we should keep it at C

because many people struggle to get their grade up even when its at a C.

Because if we changed it to were we have to get B 's their wouldn't be as many people playing sports or chasing their dream of being an professional athlete. and i think that since it has to be at a C level many people will reach the goal of getting a C or better. That is why i think the grade average should stay at a C average.
