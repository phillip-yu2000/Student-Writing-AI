The "face" on Mars wasn't created by martians. Because through disoveries in technology we have discovered that the "face" on mars is not a structure made to look like a human it is simply just a mesa.

The evidence in the passage supports my thesis because it states that since the original photo was taken in 1976 when they were looking for the Viking 1's sister ship Viking 2 places to land they saw the "face" "NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face." NASA have been taking pictures and researching the "face". Their research has helped them come to the conclusion that it is a mesa and not a martian creation to look like a human face.

Also they state here that new technology has helped them take better pictures "New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASAs Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.". NASA shortly after discovering the "face" realized that it was just another martian mesa and the facial features that it had were just shadows as stated here "the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.".

As I stated in the introduction the face on Mars is simply a mesa and not a martian creation and through the data in the passage I supported my answer that there is not an actual face on Mars.
