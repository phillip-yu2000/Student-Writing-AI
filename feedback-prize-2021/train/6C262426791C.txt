DEAR principal my name is STUDENT_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME .I come to you today to try to help decide on weather you should require students to do community service, my thoughts on this are that the kids should do community service it will help them become more responsible and respectful to and for there community. children don't always know what's best for them selves, usually they are pretty good about it but if it involves work or time away from fun the dislike of it. If we make it a requirement they tend to buckle up and do it. What im am trying to get at is that kids always need a push to succeed and if they do this and complete it i will be not only a push but a good start to there future career's. I hope you make the right choice for are future leaders of this country. give these kids an opportunity to make there life's better.

PS. when children learn they can make a big deference they tend to keep making them they tend to realize what they are truly capable of they realize they aren't just some normal child, they find someone else in themselves someone the can truly make a difference. they also find that they make new and sometime better children or friends in the prose's.
