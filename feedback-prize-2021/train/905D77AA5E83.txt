Dear Principal,

I have heard you are making a decision of whether to require community service or not. I think that if you require it, it would do a good deal on the community. First of all, if just one whole school did community service, many people would be grateful, the town would be much cleaner, and the school would become more popular.

If you required community service,

I don't think that kids would get that mad about it.

I think it would make them feel better about themselves and help them in the future. Community service isn't just about doing it because you have to, it is about doing something good community, because if you do, it will reflect back on you.

If the service wasn't required then the kids who don't do it will never do it because they were never engaged into the idea. The kids who never did it will think that you should only do community service if you have to not just as a grateful act. Community service is about doing it in your time. you use the time you have to do something good for you, your friends, and your community.

It would make the community a better environment for upcoming students and teachers, who will try to follow what previous students and teachers have done. Doing community service can help you in the future to. You might be a better person all around from being near community service. Even little thing that people do everyday make peoples lives better.

Any one can do community service, even little kids. So I am trying to persuade you into requiring community service. It will help your community in many different ways.
