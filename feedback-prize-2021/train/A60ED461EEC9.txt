Should students participate in sports, work on year book, or serve on student council. Principal asked all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Is it a good or bad decision. I think it is a good decision for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because I can learn something new for participate, meet new people during the extracurricular activity, and have a good time.

First, if I want to learn something new can get in an activity I don't know how to do or play. Instead of wasting my time in something I already know, I can use it wisely to learn new things. Lets say I don't know how to play chest I can learn how to play that instead of playing other stuff I already know how to play. Its like playing a sport I know the rules to it but don't know how to play.

Secondly, most of the people at school I don't even know. Maybe by joining other extracurricular activity I can meet new people. This reminds me when I was in a new school. The only way to meet new people is to go up to them and talk to them. Now I can just play with them and get to know what they like and other stuff. Some people are really loud,smelly,and even play good at soccer like me something I am in to. Some people are like cheats running to the ball. A lot of people are different at my other school,but in this school people are lovely to others and are kindly to me and everyone. That is how I meet new people.

Last, the last thing people should do is have fun. Enjoy while it last because it could only last a week or two. You see having fun is not only with friends it is how you have fun. It has to be something all of my friends like not just what I like. Something we can all enjoy.

I think adding the extracurricular activity is a great decision to add at school people would enjoy having it. Students will learn something new, meet new people,and have a good time. Should every school have a extracurricular activity.
