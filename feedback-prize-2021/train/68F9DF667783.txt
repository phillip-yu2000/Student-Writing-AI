I belive you should go on a adventure like my adventure. I belive that because I saw so many new things. The trip was long and tireing but I still think you should go on a trip like the trip I went on the seamen were from The SS.Charels, and The W. Wooseres. We had arrived August 14. Luke had said the Pasific war had ended. Luke turned 18 before arriving to Greece. The cattle-boat trips were were unbelievable oppertunity for a small town boy. It took us about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united States to China. This is why I am still perswading you to go on an adventure like me.

I want you to know on my adventure I went to ruins I went to Greece. Dont not let your dreams come true if you want to go somewhere just try it. I had a wonderful time going to the places were I went. I'm a towns boy who got a once in a life time opertunity. Go on an adventure of you own have a wonderful time like I did. This is why you should go on an adventure it doesnt matter what you do if its a hike or you go camping or fishing just do it.
