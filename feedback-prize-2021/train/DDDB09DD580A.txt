In the article, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author amkes serval arguements attempting to persaude the reader that a maned mission to venus would be worth while the NASA to undertake. I personnally am not move by their arguement as they have not pointed out what is to be gained in this mission outside of a deadman on Venus.

In the closing paragraph of the article they write, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likly lead out many intimidating endeavors." I ask the writer of this, what useful insight is there to be gained by this endeavor. I also think why focus Venus instead of mars, which in comparison is much more accepting host of humans. From both prior knoweledge and what was what written in this article, Venus is a literal hellscape with the only thing to be gained being death of any one foolish enough to be sent there. Even with this article's idea for blimp above the planet, I remaing unconvinced that there is any benefit in the slightest.

In conclusion, I find the Idea there is any reason, resourece,

or revolation that Venus can offer humanity in the slightest.
