Luke's point of view in this story is telling people that whatever something or someone is giving you the chance to do, do it. You never know what could happen after. He was exicted to go on the Seagoing Cowboys program. Once he did go he already took nine trips. If he didn't like going back and forth he would have been part of the program. This is telling you that you would likely like the Seagoing Cowboys program after all. If Luke point of view can see it, you can see it.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is to help take care of the rhorses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke wanted to help so he signed up, like you should. He's point of view tells you that he was happy he signed up and doesn't regret it so im pretty sure you wouldnt either. Let this be a way for you to see that you should sign up.
