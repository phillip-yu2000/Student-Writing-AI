Phone's

Well what can I say about phones there are good for some but some use it for the bad. Like example people use it while driving that's bad because they should be looking at the road they shouldn't be on their phone for any reason useless they trying to call 911 for an energy other than that there is there is no reason to be on their phone. Also there are things to hold your phone for you so you won't have to get a ticket and have to pay for it when you can have something to hold your phone for you. When using it for the good you there is no reason to worry about there is always time to use your phone but while driving is never a good time just wait until you get to the place where you are going to there is always time you don't want to lose your life or someone life because you couldn't wait for a few minutes to get to the place you need to be at its always best to wait then to lose a live there is always time for anything but losing your life or someone else life Is not it.
