When I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program I realized thing i hadn't before like how much people from other places needed help. Or that it could be so much fun.

I think you should also join the Seagoing Cowboys program also. You'll get to see China, Greece, Italy, and many other place like that. Not only that but also help people. You also could make the traveling fun like when all the animals have been unloaded you could play baseball, and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. And to pass time you could have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and games.

In conclusion you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Because it could open up a whole new world for you. You could find things about yourself you never knew about. You could make new friends and have a lot of fun. You could visit places you never been or always wanted to go. You also will find out about people from other countries and their needs.
