Dear sir or madam,

At this time of year there are many sports people want to play or never played before. There are many sports already which you need a G.P.A. for, which is good for many reasons because honestly you should be most focus on your school work then your sports but most kids would much rather be playing what they love, not at home doing math homework or any subject for that matter. Sports are a way to meet new people and see what your good at or want to do.

There are a lot of kids with the straight A' s that don't play spots. The kids who do have many things to do in the day, and school work usually comes last which makes things very easy to forget. Yes there are reminders for things like homework projects, but what about test and quizzes that can easily bring one of your B' s down and sadly no more sport now that doesn't seem too far. For kids to play sports these days there are high expectations and they have to fulfil them. Its not about winning or losing, but to most people it is.

You should have good grades, because it what helps you with college or anything you want to do like go on vacation with your school you will get interview and they look at grades to see who really should have the privilege to have the opportunity to experience something like that. Then there are the kids who have so much to do that there grades are slipping which is unacceptable for the school standards. If you put in this rule many kids wont be able to play or do what they love, if they are truly trying there hardest then that's what you get, if you try to push them to get the better grades then they might rebel and think how stupid, or how unfair it is.
