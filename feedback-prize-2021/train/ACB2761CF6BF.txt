It is not fair for students to have to have a B average to play sport's. Many students like to play sports. They will not get a chance to play sports if there average grade has to be a B. It is hard for children to get a B for their grade average.

Students should have to have a C for there grade average. Many students would like to have the chance to be in sports and other activities. In my point of view students get very busy at times. It is sometimes hard for them to get good grades. The principal should not change the school policy. The students are happy with the policy they have. They would not like it if the principal would change the school policy.

Students work hard for them to be able to play sports. At times its hard for them to keep there grade average at a C. It would be even harder for them to keep there grade average at a B. The students would get anger if the principal would change the school policy. It is because then the students would not get the chance to play sports or activities.

They may stop trying on there school work and there test scores would go low. Therefore, the principal should not change the school policy. It would keep the students very happy.
