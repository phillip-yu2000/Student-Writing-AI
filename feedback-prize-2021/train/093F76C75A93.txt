Have you ever been in a situation where you dont know what to do? Havent we all? I believe getting multiple opinions can help you make a better choice because you get different perspectives, a person/people you go to could have prior knowledge, and you get more advice/options.

First off, when you only go to one person for advice you're only getting that one persons perspective on your situation. Everyone handles things differently, so if you go to more than one person you can see how they would handle it. When you hear other perspectives on your situation you can also see what mistakes you made and how to respond to that situation.

Secondly, some people you ask along the way could have prior knowledge of situations like yours. Meaning, they could give you their wisdom. For example: if you have a friend spreading rumors about you and you go to multiple people one of them may have had the same experience as you and they can tell you what they did. This helps both of you.

Lastly, going to more than one person gives you more options on what to do. If you ask multiple people they can give you multiple answers/options. If you only only go to one person you only have that one option rather than getting multiple so you have a choice. I dont know about you but, I'd rather choose what to do than be forced to choose my one option even if its not the best.

In conclusion, asking multiple people for advice helps you make a better choice because you get multiple options, a person you go to can have wisdom about what you're getting advice on, and you get to see how other people view your situation.Â
