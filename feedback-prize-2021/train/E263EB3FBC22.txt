The principal should allow students to bring cell phones to school. He should let them use it during lunch periods and other free time. As long as they turn them of during class time or any other learning time. I think the students are old and responsible. To let them use there phones during lunch or any other free time. They should know when to use the phones.

Students should be able to use there phones during there free time. It is there free time and they should know what there going to do with it. Either walk around talk or what ever they like to do or use there phones. They are old already and they what there doing. That's why the principal should let the students. Use there phones during there free time.

The principal should also let the students use there phones during there lunch periods. There the ones that are having there lunch. There not learning there just having fun with there friends and eating. So there is no reason to not let students use there phones. During there lunch time they should know if there going to eat or not. So there is the other reason why you should let the students. Use there phones during there lunch period.

So why not let the students use there phones. During there free time or lunch time. If there not learning there just having fun. They just will have to turn them of when they have to learn. They are old and responsible to let them use there phones. So that's why you should let students use there phones when there not learning. You should really let them use there phones during there time.

The End
