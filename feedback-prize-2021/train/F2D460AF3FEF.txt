The use of cell phones in a vehiclesaaaaaaaassz

Gas and fire don't mix, so why should cell phones and the operation of a vehicle. In the essay I will be expressing my thoughts on using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. You will learn the statistics of how the majority of car crashes are caused by cell phones. I will discuss how cell phones can cause reckless driving. We will discuss ways to prevent ways of crashing while using your cell phone.

The statistics show that nearly 1.6 million crashes happen every year. Every year within those crashes 390,000 people are injured. One out of four times those crashes happen is from texting. I have a story to go along with the statistics.

A friend of mine was driving to go to the gym. On his way to the gym his father kept calling him, but he refused to use the phone while he was driving. So his dad kept calling and he thought it must be urgent. So he picked up the phone to call him back and within the first 30 seconds he crashed. Luckily it was just a minor crash and he was alright. That just goes to show you how distracting they are.

Besides speed, the most common reason for reckless driving is caused by cell phones, mainly texting. Driving requires your undivided attention, but when you're texting you're giving over half of your attention to your phone. Yes there is a hands free law that you can use but your phone still needs your attention to use the hands free law. It's like my friend's story he didn't pick up, but once he did he wrecked.

You should never be using your phone while driving. It could harm not only yourself but others too. that is why it is so important to be safe and not even think about touching your phone. All of your focus should just stay on the road.
