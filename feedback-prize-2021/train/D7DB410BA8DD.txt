Hello Mr. Senator,

I was writting to inform you about a topic that has been talked about for the past year, the Electoral Collage. This process has its pros and cons, but i'm more in the con side; you see the reason why the Electoral College needs to be abolished is because people dont really get to choose who their president is, the people who choose the president are the people in the Electoral College. How the Electoral College works is the state has electors and those electors have to be won by the president for the president to have how many electoral votes he gets from that state depending on how many electors that state has. The trick here is that sometimes the electors can deny the will of the people since the election is based on electoral votes not on popular votes, don't get me wrong people's votes do influence electors in deciding which president won their votes. Overall the electoral college is unfair to everyone because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states that they have no chance winning over so they got to the "swing" states since they have more chance of winning them over depending on their campaing. I don't think we should be trusting people to vote for us because as we have seen some electors vote for the candidate they want to win and not the candidate their state wants to win. Thats my rant about the Electoral College and I hope it makes you see clearer.

Best Regards, Alberto        Â
