Dear Senator,

I believe that we should keep the electoral college. Although they maybe known to be unfair, outdated, irrational, and an non-democractic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But I believe it is fair because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between electon of the president by a vote of congress and election of the prsident by a popular vote of qualified citizens and that when we vote we vote for electors who basically take the side of the peoples voice but do further research on the two people that are running for president and vice president. and the electoral college requires a presodential to have transregional appeal so that there won't be a solid region that has one favorite canidate because a canidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president and the other region will feel that thier votes won't count and that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he rally isn't their president. the electoral college restores some of the weight i the political balance that larger states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution and avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast whcih makes the electoral college a better and more fair way of voting.
