Dear, State Senator

I would like to inform you of the elections to the electoral college and the by popular votes, that this is to to the fact we should change by the popular votes for the president instead of the Electoral College becuse  under the Electoral college system voteres would not be able to vote not for the president but for the slate of electors,the state legislatues are being responsible  for pickig the electors so the they can vote for the people and the collge is unfair,outdated,and irrtional.

Although  being that voters will not be able to vote for the president . the voters may be able to vote but not for the president but for a slat eof electors, who in turn elect the president. these would go to congress and the vote for the electoral votes this makes it much worse to consider the state legislatures are technically.

the electors have occasionally refused to vote for thier party coanidate and casst of deciding the vite womever they would like to have it given an amount of voters to vote for one party for the president and another for the congress. they picked more electoral votes responsible for picking the eclectors could always defy the will of the people.

this is unfair ,outdatted and irrational because its in favor of mostly assertions without much basic of not letting the people vote instrad of the state legislature choosing electors to to vote to pick the presisdent .
