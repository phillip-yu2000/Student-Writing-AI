Why do people ask for a answer two or three times with different people? i mean shouldn't they already know the answer after the first person? Yes, they should, and probably do! They do if for many reasons. For example finding a method that works, and they can also get a better understanding of the subject, and by going over it again, you can learn it again and get better!

You need a method to solve almost everything, you need them most in math! If you know a good method that always works you will get the answer correct, witch means a better grade! And asking others helps with forming a method that works for you, because if you do not understand one way, you can ask another person ant they might have a different way to solve the problem. And knowing more methods is not bad, because if you forget one you have more to look back at and use. Therefor, this is a great way to find new methods.

A better understanding of something is something lots of people want, like why we can't do this or why we can't do that. Why people want that, is because of many reasons, some of which are knowing how it works better, like how you multiply, divide, add, subtract. With that you can know what to do, so if you had a problem like "3Ã¢â¬Â¢5+2" you know what to do, you multiply 3 and 5 then add 2. And you know how to do it, if you know how to do it you know 3Ã¢â¬Â¢5 is 15 and 15+2 is 17. Having a better understanding is very important!

"Re-Learning" or "Learning again" is very important! Say you forgot it and need to go over it again, you can do that by asking the teacher and another student to help you go over it, or form a study group. And if you already know, don't fear, you can just help yourself out by learning the details, you did not last time. And if you learn it again, you should be able to do it more constistnantly, so you get the right answer more often. So don't try to say "I have learned it once, I know what to do" and sat " maybe i missed something, let me check!"

So the guy asking more than one person is not dumb or weird, it is quite smart! This is a great way to learn new methods without having too much struggle. Also being able to do a problem by yourself later on without help, can show you how much you have learned! And if you forgot, relearning is a nice way to remember. So don't be shy, help yourself and others out by raising a hand or going up to someone that has the answer, or asking your teacher.
