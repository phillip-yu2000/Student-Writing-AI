This Facial Action Coding System could be good in a couple ways but its unnecessary. Computers might know what your emotions and help in a couple ways to know if you're confused about something or do not like something you see on the internet. Just because you look at someones face, it doesn't mean that they feel some type of way. Someone could be smiling or laughing but that doesn't mean that they are truely happy. It's the same thing by having a serious face.

A face expression doesn't always show someone's emotions. Other people do not care about other people's emotions. It's better to notice things with your own eyes than a computer or machine to tell you how somebody is "feeling". The article says you can tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. That's true because you know that person very well.

People do want to hide their emotions for their own specific reason. We all have that moment when we would want to keep our feelings to ourselves. We wouldn't like for systems to know our emotions.
