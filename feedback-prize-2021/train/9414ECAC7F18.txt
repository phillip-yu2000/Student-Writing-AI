Driveless cars in my opinion it could be a great experiance but also my biggest concern in safetywise not being the one controling the car and also being to didtracted in case of having to take over of the car it's the biggest concern. As new technology its being made we depend more out of it and making everything easier for us and this cars are just another advantage of newer technology. Having one of this cars could be helpful but it also makes me think a lot about it.

Driveless cars could be a big consern in fact "I don't think not many people could afford such thing also replacing a new part of the car if it's not funcioning as it suppost to could be costly as well. This car are a great idea but I'm not agree to it also I'm not against either because many other people could actually be interested in such thing, but we should still have drivers in cars for more safety. All the concerning of this cars is not being able to control it and how safe are they. Also laws need to be made and also the prices of the cars. Now that many different companies of cars are developing this technology, there for what about if the technology fails. What could we do? it the company of the car going to take care of it what law its going to defend us in case of a technology fail? What would happend to the cars that are already here? Also the smart cars? having to change cars when every new technology its made could be pretty expencive.

Lawmakers say that safety is best achieved with alert drivers, meaning that the driverless cars still need a human but how do people suppost to be alert if not having to do nothing just concentrating could be boring.

All the discution will have answers as automakewrs continue their works and lawmakers aprove the idea and make safety laws about the car and just being alert and know how to control the car and take good advantage of the newer technology.
