Luke Bomberger was living a normal life till his friend Don Reist asked if he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no to that once in a lifetime opportunity! It's World War II in Europe and many countrys are in ruins. They need help taking care of their animals and shiping them over seas. Luke and Don signed up. "We arrived August 14," Luke said. They where traveling over the Pacific ocean and going to Greece with 335 horses and food for them. Luke turned 18 before they got there and wanted to sign up for tthe military service. "By the time be was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips, the most of the Seagoing Cowboys." Luke loved this new life of cattle-boat trips and helping people. On his free time be would explore Europe even more. It took him 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the United States and then a month to get to China. Caring for the animals kept Luke busy and they where fed and watered two or tree times a day, and stalls had to be cleaned. Luke has had some training on Katie's farm as a small boy and helped him where he is now. "Luke also found time to have fun on board." Luke said. There is many things to do on the ship such as baseball, vollyball and table-tennis. Luke did Seagoing Cowboys for many year later and loved every bit of it.
