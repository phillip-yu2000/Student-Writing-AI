Think about when you were just about to turn 16 you were so exited. You would finally be abel to drive and have freedom. Well if we make cars that drive them selfs that could be gone and many other great things. I think this is a bad idea. Having cars that drive them selfs could be dangerous too it says in the passage that they are driver assisted and that a person still has to be in the car just in case they need to take over. Well if i get tried and im not driving and I fall asleep what happens whe the car needs mecto drive ? "Manufactures are also consedering using cameras to watch that the drivers are remaining focused on the road." Well ok but what about my privacy? Think about when you were young and would go to a secret spot with your boyfreind or girlfreind, what if that camrea recored that or someone hacked into the camrea and watched. If a crash happens how would ypu determine if it was the cars fault or yours? There is so many more problems with having cars that drive themselfs. I dont think we should have cars that drive them selfs too much fun is lost and new challenges with laws will occer.
