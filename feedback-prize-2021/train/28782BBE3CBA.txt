Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think this change in policy is unneeded for many reasons and I hope that this letter will help you come to my understanding. Many students at this school participate in sports and some of them are not very good at school work but they at least have a passing grade. Some students have a lot on their hands not only at school, but at home as well. If you make this policy official then it will put more stress on students to keep up with their grades more than ever, and if they have more stress on them they will perform poorly at tournaments and meets. Some may not be able to even compete because they are at home trying to do work to keep a b average.

I can see why you would want to keep students grades up and keep the student body as smart and hard working as possible, but some students can't handle that kind of pressure added on to what they've already got going on. So in conclusion you should just keep the policy that you and so many other schools have kept for years and years to come. In this way maybe we can have a few more students winning medals and district championships than in the schools past years.
