Dear principal,

I think that they should not do that because a lot of a sport players don't get a b average. I think it should a least be a c average. I know people who a great a sports but not in school. if they do that not a lot of people would be on the sport team or it could work and people bring their grade up. so they can play on the team. that is my opinion on the article. In activities people do have good grades and some people don't. i think if the person is trying to do work they should play. you have to think about the students who just ain't good in math, language arts ,social studies ,and science. that could be half the team and almost the whole activities that people do and no body would be there because of you doing that. that is why i say you should not do that.
