Dear, Principal

I think Policy 1 should go. Because if she dose allow us to have phone at school that would be cool. Because we can text at school to our moms and dads when we need stuff we don't have walk all the way to the office when we need to call. We can just text them. We wont waste your time at all. We will get a better graders at school. We will turn in all of our work in on time. You will get more students to go to this school. The teachers will get more money for having a lot of student in their classroom . We only need to use the phones during Free time or lunch but our phones need to be turn off during class. If the teachers catch us texting during class you can take it way from us and give back when you want to give it back.
