In The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. It could help us with future problumes of popultion and or if are planet dies.

The sister planet venus should be looked at more closely to see if we can inhabait this planet orif it was inhabited by other species. NASA says, "On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"(3). Because of the heat it could be the reson why the unmaned spacecrafts don't survive for more then a few hours.

The technology of today might be advenced but more sensetive to venuses conditions. "Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"(7). Older technology can be more improved but not changed by that much. Making spacecrafts from this technology and metals could help peraces into the atmospher and give us a view of what the ground might look like.

By pursuiting to explore this challenge could help us understand if there was ever a bigger spand of life then us. Despite the dangers it presents we could know more and understand what caused it's fall. The resurech of this planet that we know could be enoght to go thorgh a plan to find what is under the 97 percent of carbon dioxide that cover venus.
