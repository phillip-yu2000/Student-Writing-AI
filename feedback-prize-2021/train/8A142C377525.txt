School offer a lot when it comes to learning and now they are offering more than ever with distance learning. Distance learning is a good thing for students because they can finish a class without ever leaving their home. Yes some people make the argument that its a bad thing because the student isnt with the teacher and can't ask questions. Well students and teachers both have emails that they can ask question and answer the questions the student has.

With online classes and virtual school students wont have to wake up at the crack of dawn anymore to get to school. With students being able to sleep the amount their bodies need they will learn better and not falling asleep in the middle of a lesson. Kid's sleeping has always been a thorn in the side of schools backs due to the fact that the student will miss whats being taught to them. Now that online classes are coming more popular kids will be able to stay awake throughout the entire lesson.

Kid's get taken out of the school day all the time for no reason and miss whats going on for the rest of that day. When a student gets sick they miss a couple of days and have no idea whats going on when they get back. Student's don't have to miss a single day of class with virtual school. They are already home and can just log onto their computer and see what they have to do for the class today.

Distance learning is a great thing it's going to help many student's graduate high school and accomplish their dreams in life. Online classes and virtual school are great thing and more schools need to be implementing them into their system. So student's can accomplish what they want to in life.
