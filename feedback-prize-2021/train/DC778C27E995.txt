Most students dislike summer assignments, could that change if they desgined the assignment themselves? Summer assignments can be a chore that students are unhappily forced to complete. I believe that if students could design their own summer projects they would be more willing to complete it because it promotes creativity, gives them control over how they do their project, and gives it an overall feeling that its not just another boring assignment.

Others could say that without direction students wouldn't know what to do. However; without that direction students can have full creativity over what they do. From multiple tests i've seen, when a student is allowed to work how they want their creativity and willingness to work increases tenfold. Given the opportunity to be creative on their own, students can and will be more productive and willing to complete an assignment.

No one likes to be told what to do, this is all the same for students. If students are given control over how they work on projects and assignments they are much more productive. The freedom a student can feel when given control over a project will only encourage them to continue learning throughout the summer.

School can be a boring and repetitive place for students, multiple assignments all feeling the same can wear them down. When summer rolls around its a breathe of relief, until they realize there is still more learning to do. If students designed their own project however, that could all change and very well could be excited to actually continue learning throughout the summer.

In conclusion, students dislike assignments, especially during the summer. But if a student was allowed to design and create it themselves it would not only promote creativity, give them control over the project allowing them to not feel chained to the rules, and give them the mindset that they are not just completing another assignment.
