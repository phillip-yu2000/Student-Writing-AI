Do you need help when it comes too challenging sitituions and problems? Things aren't that easy in the world when sititutions you just don't know what to do, seeking or asking for someone advice is very help in a way. For example picking an new outfit for school you like two choices but don't know which one to pick because the two outfits are both cute so you ask one of your family members or ask a friends for their opinions on which outfit is the best looking.

There are problems in life where you just don't know what direction to go in. Asking a good amount of people for their advice or their options are good so you can see an other person point of view or perspective of what they seem is good or bad for the sitituions. Like looking for a car isn't that easy there are so many brands,colors and other feature on a car you might like and it might be more than one you like but just don't know what to choice.

Advice can be and good, helpful thing or bad, hurting thing some people are gonna give you good advice that can help you in a way and some people are gonna give you horrible advice that can hurt you in a way, say you are dealing with a sitituion with your boyfriend or girlfriend some people advice is gonna be that y'all should talk and work the problems out well on the other hand someone is gonna tell you that you don't need him or her or that person should apologize first when you were wrong and you might listen. It depends are what kind of sititution a person is in on what type of advice too give that person. However ther people advice might not sastifed you or help you so something you just might have to go with your own advice and opinions.
