How can we stop pollution from destroying the Earth and everything that  lives inside of it. If we take a look around us we try to save the Earth by recycling things that reusable. Well its not enough, we have to reduce one of the major cause that is making the greenhouse gas increased. Cars are use in our everyday life, to work, to school,and to buy groceries. We use cars for everything and the toxic gases release by cars are killing the Earth. This toxic gases are being release into the air we breath in. This gases are affecting us and the environment the animals live in, but is also affecting the Earth.

We depend on the Earth everyday, when we wake up we expect the sun to shine on our face and the plants expect the light from the sun to observe carbon dioxide and release oxygen, our major source of surviving. 12 percent  of greenhouse gas is due to passenger in Europe, but in the United States  it takes up to 50 percent in cars intensive. For example in Paris, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city from pollution. Almost 4000 drivers were charge for driving their own vehicle instead of any type of transportation on that day. If we really want to change the world and really help our planet we should follow the example of Bogota, Colombia, they set up a program that lead to a car free day, many Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work the result for this was that the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.

Saving our planet is not difficult all you got to do is reduce pollution by recycling reusable things, use less energy in you home and use less water. Finally reduce using your own transportation use other things that will make you appreciate Earth for everything she has done for us. We can reduce pollution and greenhouse gas if we set our mind to do it.
