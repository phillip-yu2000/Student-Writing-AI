What I believe is that your either trying to get attention or really going through a hard difficult time and the people you already went to and gave you advice didnÃÂ´t really help with what you going through or trying to do. You really just want a person to give you really good advice and see if it help you, if it doesnÃÂ´t help you go talk to another person and see if the advice they give you is more comfortable and helping. The reason some people do this is because they probably get the same advice the other person already told you and already tried doing that and it just doesnÃÂ´t seem to do anything really. What i would to is try to go find a person that has been through the stuff your going through/trying to do and take their advice it really help because that person has already been through those things or tried to do those things and went to someone that has already been through it to and took their advice and it really seem to work.

They might just also go get advice from multiply people to see which advice the person gives them is best. They can also just be going to person to person for advice to see if they are really there and car about you when your going through a really difficult time. They can be doing that because the person they went to first was not really giving them advice about what your going through and just throwing things in that donÃÂ´t even make sense. I would just go to someone that really gets you and is there for you and knows how you feel.

Some people that do this just really want comfort because you never know what their going throw and really just wanna take everything off there mind and just want advice for all the things their going through. It really is hard to find someone with good advice but you never seem to find a person that give you that one good advice. I would do the same and get advice from other people its just better it give you comfort and more things that you can do to help you
