I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is a good idea. Olny because in paragraph 3 it explains how the computer can recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions and he explains really good how the six basic emotions express how we feel. Dr. Paul Eckman explains it in paragraph 3 he says this

"For example you frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised".

Then that's when Dr. Huang comes in at he says "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal".

Dr. Huang uses things like video imagery, the emotion-recognition, it tracks the facial movements. It can track the facial movements in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa. Dr. Huang explain that " by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."

In paragraph 5 it says that "Its a fact that humans perform this same impressive calculation every day". It also says in paragraph 5 that "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face" and 9/10 times that's ture. When your with a friend and he/she is mad your going to know and ask he/she wht's wrong.

Paragraph 6 says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." That's something I never knew or heard about!

Dr. Huang and other DRs. is stating things I never knew about in this artitcle. The artitcle is well explained.

This is why I said it is a good idea becaue they explained it really good. They had facts and had a good reason for it. I think this artitcle will make you think it's a good idea. So that's why I said this was a good idea.
