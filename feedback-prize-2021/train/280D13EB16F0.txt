In my opinion I think students should not have to participate in a extracurricular activity because students might need to get home at a certain time, but if they have to do a extracurricular activity they can't. Another reason is they might have to go somewhere, but if they have to do a extracurricular activity they can't be there. Also students might have health problems and doing a extracurricular activity might affect them.

Reasons why students should have to take a extracurricular activity are it can help students become healthier. Another reason is if a students parents don't get off from work till a certain time they can have there child stay after school and do a extracurricular activity until they get off work and can pick them up. Also students might be behind in there work and if they have to do a extra curricular activity they can stay after school and get all caught up on there work.

Therefore this is why I think students should not have to a extracurricular activity because students might need to get home at a certain time, but if they have do a extracurricular they can't. They might also need to be somewhere at a certain time. Another reason is some students might have health problems so if they have to do a extracurricular activity it might affect them.
