I think they shouldn't because kids won't have any time to play or they won't have any time to do there homework. It will make school even worst. And when you get home you won't feel like doing any homework.

Think they should do the people that want to stay they can stay but the people that want to go home they can. I think the idea would help but not everybody has to stay. They should do the people that are doing bad tell them to stay after so they can get extra help. That way when they get to school they will already know what to do. That way when they have a test those students will be ready to get a good grade.

I also think they shouldn't because of the buses they should be at home not still picking up kids. They should not be working in the afternoon because that when everybody that works come home. They work so hard driving us home every day then they have to wake up the next morning and do it again. I don't think they get paid that much and they drive us every day. And the teachers that stay after school with us I don't even think they get paid that much and they stay after school just to help us so we can graduate.

It would help us in somemany ways but is it good for the staff. I think the janaders work here longer then anybody. And they do there best to clean the school. I think if work here that long I think they should get paid more. They don't leave the school until every thing is clean.

I don't like after school because of the work but I have stay in order to pass but I don't think everybody should praticipate in after school. And the schools need to start paying the teachers that stay after more for staying after.

I wouldn't have to stay if I had got my work done.
