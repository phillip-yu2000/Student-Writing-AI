While i feel like this could help with a few thing i feel as if it would just hurt humans in the long run because people will start to rely on the computers to tell them how other people are feeling, and that jsut makes it harder for the few people that help other people to help them when they are in need. This would be because we wouldnt be able to tell if ther person is scared or worried or just in need of help from anyone.

First of all, my biggest problem with this is that we cant rely on computers to tell us everything they cant feel what we feel when we look in the eyes of someone else. Not to metion that a computer can only do as much as we program it to do so it can only know all that we have discovered so it cant tell the different emotions of any accuratly because it doesnt know their give aways or how well they hide their emtions.

Secondly, you cant just base someone's emotions off of their facial expressions. This is because everyone including me find ways to hide how they are feeling and find ways to make their face look unemtional. To this effect people can control their facial muscles to a different degree of effiecenty. So, there for the computer would possible give inaccurate reports over and over again.

So, in the end I dissagree with that fact that this computer can tell how people are feeling based on their facial expressions. This is because for one they can't know for sure how well the person can control the muscles in their face, secondly they cant see the look in the eyes of the person and feel the emotion that is coming off the person who is looking at the computer. Finally, these are the reasons i can not agree with this article that you can tell someones emotions with just a computer instead of another human being.
