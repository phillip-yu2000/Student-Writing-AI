Dear Principal,

I am a student and I believe that policy 1 will work more than policy 2. I think this because the students will not stop bringing them to school. Some might stop bring their phones to school but most will likely not stop carrying their phones to school.

Policy 1 has some good advantages. One advantage is that you still have your phone with you and you cant use it but during class. Another one is you can use your phone during lunch and free time. You really don't need your phone that bad. If you need it really bad the teachers will let you use their class phone or they can say you can use your own phone to call home or something.

Policy 2 has some good advantages also. One is you can not get caught texting during class if you don't have your phone. No body can steal your phone. no one can look at your phone if you don't have your phone with you.

Policy 1 has disadvantages too. They can be as easy as feeling weird because you are not texting during class. That means now you have to pay more attention to the teacher instead of your phone.

Policy 2 has disadvantages. They can be like you feel like you left your phone somewhere so you worry about that all day and not your class work.

I think policy 1 will work better than policy 2 because for policy 1 you have your phone with you but it is not on so you don't have to worry about it if you left it somewhere or someone took it. That is just a statement for me because I am a student and that's what I feel about that topic.
