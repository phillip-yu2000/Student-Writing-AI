Hi, I would like to show you some cool things about being in the Seagoing Cowboys. The first thing I want to tell you is, that when you are traveling somewhere you get to see all the beautiful sight's! Every cowboy get's to have fun. While you are traveling you get to play games and everything! The Seagoing Cowboys are always having fun. There are animals on the boat too. They are very fun and you even have the chance to get to take care of them.

Luke has particapaed in this progam and these are a few words he said,''I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.'' He also said,'' The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy!'' On Luke's first trip they had 335 horses and all the food they needed to feed them. Luke said he had so much fun.

The experience you will have will last for a lifetime. There is so much to do. Even though there is so much fun there still is hard things you have to do. But, once you get past that it will be fine. If you like sports sometimes they throw a ball around.

Everyone, this is such a fun thing to do so please sighn up for this amazing program. You will love it! I mean, you get to travel everywhere. Luke got to go to china and on the way he got to travel on the Atlantic Ocean! I have never done this before but, it sounds like a lot of fun! Luke was so happy he got to do this. I am sure that he would suggest everyone to particapate. I hope this has incouraged you to sighn up for this program. It is a great program so please sighn up for the Seagoing Cowboys.
