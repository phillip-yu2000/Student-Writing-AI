To begin with, I think we should keep Electoral Colleges because there are many benefits. A Electoral College is a process not a place in wich the founding fathers established to compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and eleciton of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Some of the many benefits are a voiding run-off elections, it helps citizens votes be more meaningfull.

For starters, Electoral Colleges help avoid run-off elections. The benefit of having it avoid run-off elections is, that when there is a run-off election and when no canidates win a majority of the votes cast; the pressure is greatly reduced because of the electoral colleges. As a example, as a example you only have 43 percent majority of the popluarity votes. If more votes in the college is elected to one president than the other the president is alot more likely to win.

In addition, another reason on why we should keep Electoral Colleges are because it helps citizens votes seem more meaningfull. How a Electoral College does this is by, making you vote more powerful. If we didnt have these colleges democrats in Texas, and Republicans in California would know there vote wouldnt mean anything therefore they would not pay much attention to the election than if they knew the president was picked by populat votes. That is why in 2012 only half of the eligable voters voted because they knew that there vote would not make a difference.

In conclusion, that is why i think we should keep our Electoral Colleges, because is helps by avoiding run-off elections, and it helps citizens votes more meaningfull and has more power to know that popularity votes now count because of the Electoral Colleges and more elegible can now vote with confidence.
