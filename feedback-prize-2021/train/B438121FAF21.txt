Do you believe in aliens? If so, what is your evidence? In "Unmasking the Face on Mars", conspiracy theorists believe in 1976 the Viking snapped a photo of an alien face on Mars. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor re-took the photo of the Face with sharper cameras. The Face on Mars is a natural landform that appeared as an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Cydonia, or Red Planet, revealed unusal shawdows which made the Face look like an Egyptian Pharaoah. The MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. After released on the JPL web site, the photo revealed a natural landform. Later in 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took another trip to Cydonia on a cloudless summer day. They snapped an extraordinary photo using the camera's maximum pixel use. The picture later revealed a Martian equivalent of a butte.

After all of the photos being investigated, the photos revealed a landform shaped like a Face. NASA proved to conspriacy theorists that they were not hiding anything about the Face on Mars. The MOC team also proved that the photos did not show any evidence of an alien face on Mars. Finally, the MGS, NASA, and the MOC teams all revealed the photos to the public on the JPL web site for the public to view and leave there opinion on the Face on Mars.
