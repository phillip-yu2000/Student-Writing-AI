I think the students should be able to choose whether they want to do community service or not because not everybody is in shape to do alot of things around the community because they could have had surgery or their bones might be to weak to be walking around all the time, and if they have things wrong with them like that then you should not make them have to do that and be up all the time walking around and doing everything for you that you don't want to do and they should not have to do that as specially if you don't want to do it and say that your not going to do it then why even say that they have to or even try to make it a law that everybody has to do it except for adults and we have enough to worry about like our school work getting chores done at home and taking care of ourselves and our pets, so that don't give us any time to do community service unless we want to and if we have free time to do and if that was to ever happen then it should at least be only twice a week and we should be able to pick the days then we should be able to get a sheet of paper so that way we can write down what we picked up from around the community and then each piece of trash we pick up should be some kind of bonus and the same if we were to help people out like say they needed help loading up the groceries in the car and they couldn't do it all by themselves and that is my opinion. I am pretty sure that alot of other teenagers would think the same exact thing and if the principle tried to make it any longer i think that everybody would go on strike.
