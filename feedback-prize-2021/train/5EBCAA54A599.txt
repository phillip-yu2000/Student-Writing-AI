Dear Principal,

Your first policy sounds a lot more plausible and lenient to me than the second policy. School's shouldn't take phones away from the students. It'll only cause us to be more angry and use them further. If you suggest a less strict rule such as "Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times." I believe it will encourage the kids to only use cell phones during those times, or at least use them less frequently during class hours.

One reason I believe this is I, myself text in the lunchroom. Only because I need something from my mother or to ask a friend something during class free time. If my school let students have their phones out in free times[Or during lunch] they'd probably become less rowdy and are less likely to text during class, for most classes have free time towards the end of class or at the beginning.

Another reason why the first policy would by more appealing is that, if you allow kids to have their phones during free time it might make them feel more at home or relaxed with the environment, so they could open their minds to learning the lessons in the classroom and text when their outside of the classroom.[Or when the lesson is done]

I believe that kids only text in class because they feel like its a normal and rebellious thing to do. They feel bored in class so they text, but if you allow texting to be allowed in classroom free times they won't feel the need to text while the teachers trying to teach, they'll just think "Oh, I'll just text him/her during free time"

Therefore, that is why I believe in your first policy [students should be able to have their phones out during free time and lunch time only] and I hope you are convinced.

Signed,

A Student
