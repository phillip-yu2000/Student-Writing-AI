The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. One reason is that for example if you read one of your friends emotions using this technology your feelings about them might change based on how they feel. People might not want others to know about their feelings or emotions so they show a different feeling or emotion and not be truthful then, you might not feel the same way you did in the beggining if you find out. "To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."

Another reason why this technology is not valuable is that some people don't want their emotions to be known, they want to keep it to themselves. Finding out someones emotions even though if they don't want it to be known is not something that people would want.

Finaly, it might affect many students relationship. For example if someone finds out about thier friends feeling they might not feel the same way they did before; they might not communicate anymore. Dr. Huang says "Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa". Tracking someones emotions even on an image or painting is not fine unless the person on the image or painting is okay with it.

In conclusion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. This technology would not help in any ways, but it will affect relationships and it crosses someones personal space like finding out someones emotions even if they don't want it to be known.
