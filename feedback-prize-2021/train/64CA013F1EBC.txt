Have you ever woderd why the president was selected a certain way? Well i bet you did not know that it is called the electoral college. I am Going To tell you about how our president is choosen and why some people dont like thre way they are choosen.

Did you know that in the Electoral College there has to be a total of 538 Electors. Most of 270 votes are needed to elect a new president. Each canidate running for president has there own group of elector. The peresidential Election happens every four years on the tuesday after  the first monday in november. then we all vote and they do all these tallying on how much electoral votes they got. Not all people agre with the voting system some say its not what we the people really want sometimes. Some People belive that it is the Electors who get to choose.

Some people belive its not fair.

We belive its not far because the electoral are using us for our votes we dont get anything out of it. The state legislature is the one who picks the electors. They are chooseing people they knoe will not be our side. The electoral college is unfair to voters beause of the winner take all rule. The electoral college is unfair,outdated and irrational.

Electoral college method of selecting the presidents messes with potentional voters alot .The Electors Has no hope for who they are eleted  for they just do what they have to do to get there votes. Knowing there vote wll have no affect .

All electoral  college voters vote for a slate of electors who elect the president .The Electors can be anyone not gholding public office.

Now you see our big issue with the electoral college they are unfair and dont acre about our votes. the electoral college just throws our votes in the ditch somewhere we need to stop this nonsense they are not giving us what we want.
