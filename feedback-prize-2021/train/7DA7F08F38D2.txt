Why do people talk to more than one person when they ask for advice. I think people talk to more than one person because they need/want more than one opinion. they just want to make the right choice.

If you donÃÂ´t ask more than one person then more people could not want to hang out with you. I say that because some people are harsh and would not like what you beside to do. Most of the time people ask multiple people because they want more people to like what they do then more people hate what they do.

If you are trying to be the president of the United States then you will want more people to vote for you. the more people you ask and see what they want then you can say ÃÂ¨if I am president then I will do these thingsÃÂ¨. Then you would have a better chance of becoming president of the United States.

If you are going to a really nice restraint then you are going to want to read other peopleÃÂ´s reviews/opinions. If you see that a lot of people liked it there then you are most likely to want to go there. But if a lot of people donÃÂ´t like it there then you probably wont want to go there.

That is why I think people ask more than one person for there opinions.
