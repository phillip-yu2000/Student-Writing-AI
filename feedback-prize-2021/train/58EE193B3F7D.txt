Wanting to try out but cant because of that B average rule. The crying of the kids that cant try out. The coach mad about this new rule because most of the students at the school that are good at sports have about a C average. The sport teams is going to stink this year because of the new rule. This would be terrible to the parents and the people that come because they thought that their child was going to play in the game but their not even on the team because of the grade. Therefore i believe that have a B average for sporting events only is bad for the school, the coaches, and the parents.

Now picture a world were the natural athletes that are good at the sport play good. Then they will make a name for the school. Then and only you can raise up your grade. Then you can become the perfect student and a great athlete. This way you can make the principal happy if she liked sports and a lot more people would come.

In my experience I've had the exact same situation before were when i was in seventh grade. I had bad grades but not so bad that i was failing. I was trying out for the basketball and you need at least a 2.0 grade point average and i was about a 2.2 but as soon as i get on the team i got my grades. That did all the best for me. then i become better at sports and better at school.

All in all i would not go for have a B average to play sports.
