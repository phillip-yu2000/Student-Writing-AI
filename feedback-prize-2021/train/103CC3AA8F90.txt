I think students should be able to participate in sports or activities even if they have a "C" average .

It wouldn't be fair in my opinion that students wouldn't be able to participate just because they don't have a "B" , that means mostly all the students wouldn't be able to play sports or do activities .

I would understand if they had a "D" or and "F" , that would make more sense for them not to be able to participate or be able to do a sport ,

because those grades are bad and they gotta earn it .

Allot of kids like playing soccer and basketball .

Me i like playing soccer and if i wasn't able to play it because of my "C"

id be very upset , yet then again i would try raising my grade up so i could play sports and do activities here at my school .

I think students should have at least a high "C" to be able to play in sports and do activities as well .

In conclusion i don't think the principal should do that because one;

i don't think its fair and two; there would be allot of upset people . We probably wouldn't even have sports or do activities with those C' s.

That's just my opinion .
