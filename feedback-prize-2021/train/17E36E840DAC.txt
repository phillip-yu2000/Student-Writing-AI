NASA recently discovered an unusal landmark, on Mars. According to the text NASA discovered the landmark in 1976, and they weren't sure why the landmark was shaped how it was, a face. This shows that many people had many questions and disbelief of what NASA had been telling the public. This proves that many people where arguing that NASA was not being truthful about what they have discovered. Therefore, people where getting angry with NASA.

NASA was telling the truth, it was just an landmark. Many citizens thought it was a sign of intellignece life, and didn't believe what NASA was telling them. NASA was excited about this discovery, and wanted everyone to know. They didn't hide anything, there still was not any prove of intelligence life on Mars. NASA was saying, that if they found intelligence life, they would tell the whole world. They wouldn't try to hide such a mind blowing discovery.

Even though NASA was telling the truth about everything they have discovered, and told the public that if they found life on Mars, they would tell the whole world, that isn't something they would hide. The public still wasn't convinced. NASA would love to discover life on Mars. They sent more robots over to Mars to get better images, with better pixels, so they could get closer and see if there were huts and any other landmarks. NASA said they would never hide something so big, and important from the public or the world.
