After the war, countries were left in ruins, but not for long. A special organization called UNRRA is helping to recover their food supply, animals, and more. But then, UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys which took care of the horses, young cows, and mules. I, Luke Bomberger, was one of those "cowboys".

I believe that the Seagoing Cowboys is a great program because it will save many animals lives. Not only is it saving the animals, but it will also save the owners because they rely on them as a food source or even as transportation. As it says in the text, you not only participate in a great event, but you also get to go on a tour. Because the animals you need to pick up are so far away across the Atlantic Ocean, you can see many countries as well as Crete and China. I also found time on board to where I could actually play games and have fun besides feeding animals.

Not only doing chores for the other-side of the world is helpful, but I believe it can also be very fun. The only way for you to realize it, is to experiece it. Life is short, take big risks, like lending a helping hand.
