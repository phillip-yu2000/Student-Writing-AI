I think that we should keep the Electoral college rule. This is simply because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have always used this rule in all of our elections for presidents. Also because it is win or take all in this process witch mean if the canidate gets a majority of the votes then he or she gets the votes for that state.

I think we should keep the Electoral college this is because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have been going by this rule for all of our past elections and for all of our winning canidates. we have never changed or strayed off from this rule why should we all of the sudden change it? I do not think we should change it because some people disagree with it. You can have your own opinion about it but i do not think just because of someone's opinion we should change what we have been doing for many years before them.

Also i think we should not change this because it has helped us for so long to help elect the president. As in if he or she gets a majority of the votes for that state the they get all the votes for that state. It is a win or take all position. This also allows the people to have a vote and say of who the president should be and who they want it to be.

I understand why alot of people disagree with the Electoral college rule though. This is because the voters who do not get a majority rule do not have a vote in who will be president. This makes people angry and upset because there vote does not matter and will not mean anything if the other people get the ma
