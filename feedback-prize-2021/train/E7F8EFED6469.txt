When you ask for advice, you always want to get the best opinion. But how can you know for sure it is the best advice? Somebody might tell you one thing, but then somebody else says another. Theres no real way to get the best advice from just one person. Asking multiple people will give you a better outcome then just asking one person.

Lets say you have a problem, and you dont know how to solve it. You ask a friend for advise, and they tell you what they think you should do. Now, there is one opinion from one person. This could be very helpful advise, or it could be awful advise. You would never know without getting another opinion from another person. Getting multiple pieces of advice is a very good thing to do. A real life example would be when it was almost the end of the quarter and I had no service hours. I asked my friend who told me to cheat and make a fake email address. I asked somebody else and they said they were going to do some service hours the next day, and that I could do it with them. If I had not gotten two opinions, I could have risked getting an even worse grade and getting in trouble.

Nowadays, people are so quick to jump off the boat. They get one opinion, and then they go with it. Ive seen some of my friends ask what to do about things, Like not studying for tests, and not doing homework. They usually get bad advise. If they had gotten some more opinions, then they have more of a chance of being better off. This is why asking multiple people for there advice can create a better outcome.

In conclusion, asking more people for there advise is always a better option. You can get more in depth results, and you can get better opinions. You can also make less mistakes, and have better outcomes to situations. Asking other people gives you a wide variety of options and leads to much better advise. This is why asking more then one person for advise is the best option.
