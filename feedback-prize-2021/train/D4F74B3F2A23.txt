The Seagoing Cowboys program. The program where you get to have adventures of visiting amazing places and helping others. Luke particapated in the Seagoing Cowboys program and he had blast in the program. Thats why he wants others to participate in the program so they can have great time with their friends or themselves. In Luke's adventure he visited New Orleans, Greece, Europe, China, Venice, Italy, and even a excavated castle in Crete and marvled at the Panama Canal on his way to china. Also you have to help others by feeding caring animals two or three times a day but it is all worth it. But sometimes you have to be careful in the one of the trips because you might get in a accident. Luke got a injury from slipping down on a slippery ladder and landed on his backside on rainy day. You can also do some fun activities on board. In Luke's adventure the cowboys played baseball, volleyball games, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and even reading. So thats why i think others should participate in the program so they can have an amazing adventure.
