Does the electoral college work? I don't think so, but some people may. I think the United States should not keep the Electoral College and should chose the president by popular vote. I think they should use popular vote for a many of reasons but I'm only going to explain a few of my reasons now.

My first reason is that, under the electoral college, voters do not vote for who they think should be president but for electors who vote for them. I dont think this is right because the electors they chose may not choose the person they wanted. I think it's unfair. Voters should vote for the person they think should be president.

My next reason is that the electoal votes may tie. If this happens, the election will be turned to the House of Represenitives, which would then vote on the president and the Senate would choose the vice-president. I think this is unfair because I also think they should let the public vote. I just don't agree with someone voting on some one to vote for you.

Finally, I think the electoral college is just simply unfair to voters. It's unfair because if candidates don't think they have a chance in a state they don;t spent much time there. They focus more on the places they have more of a chance of winning. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all and voters in 25 of the largest markets in the United states didn't see a single campain ad.

The electoral college is unfair to the public. I think they should abolish the electoral college and vote on the president by popular vote. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much in reality. Just think about it, it would be a lot more fair to people if they did away with the electoral college and just used popular vote.
