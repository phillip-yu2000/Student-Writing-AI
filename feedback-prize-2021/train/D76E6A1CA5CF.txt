Dear Principal,

I believe that policy one (1) is the better policy to consider. I believe this because all though cell phones may be a distraction to us during class, they are also important for us to have. I say that they are important for us to have because many students have to walk home and if something were ever to happen to one of the students and they didn't have their cell phone on them they would not be able to call anyone for help. Our parents also use our cell phones to check up on us to make sure we are okay and to make sure they know where we are.

Say that we participate in one of the after school programs and we are not allowed to have our phones at school at all. Maybe we have to walk home or we have made plans to hang out with our friends after the program. If we have to walk home and need to get a-hold of our parents we wouldn't be able to because of that fact that we don't have our cell phones.

I do think that allowing the student body to use their cell phones during their lunch period and free time is also a good idea because if we know that there is a time where we do get to use our phones without getting in trouble, we are more likely to reply to that text or to send out another one until lunch or that free time. I hope you take my letter to heart and deeply consider.

Thank you for your time.

sincerely,
