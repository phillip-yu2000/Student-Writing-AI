Scientist have clues that can lead up to life on mars, but we have no proof. Recently scientist found water on mars, which is needed for life, but we have no set in stone proof that aliens do exist. They are still searching for the proof that they are out there some where, if there is any proof at all. This could all be a search for nothing.

25 years ago an interesting shape was found on the planet Mars. This shape is the shape of an egyption face. Many thought it was a sign of life outside of Earth. It went viral. Really it was a landform common around the American West. The process of creating this was done over many years, many life times. It was not aliens, it was the work of plate techtonics.

One day scientist may find solid proof that aliens exist. They are getting closer and closer to new evidence to new things, some we didn't know existed. But for now, aliens are still mythological and the face is not an alien artifact.
