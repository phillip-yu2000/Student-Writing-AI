As time progresses and technology advances, ideas that we see as futuristic are becoming our reality. The world around us is changing, and technology has a huge impact on it. Our everyday lives have been simplified from machines that have been designed to do our work for us. Something people use everyday are cars. So, is advancing cars the next step for improvement or will it be best kept as an idea?

Driverless cars has both pros and cons, but overall will do more harm than good. Car wrecks are very common and can happen to anyone. If we drive our cars by ourselves we feel as if we have more power or control over the car and its actions. A car designed to do the driving for you could be helpful in some ways, but would you want to put your all of your trust into a machine that has the power to take your life? Just like our cellphones and other everyday devices, they mess up. Failure in technology will always occur no matter how nice the product or idea might be. Although driverless cars will not fully be completly driverless. You still can have the ability to take over the driving, but then what is the point? People have been driving cars for years and years. It is better to not fix what is broken, than to adapt to a different lifesyle.

In conclusion, the future may be rising, but sometimes it is better to leave things the way they are. As time goes on, more advances will be added to cars to enchance the way we drive. Until then, a car needs its driver.
