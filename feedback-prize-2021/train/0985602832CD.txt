phones i think phones should be allowed in school because if you forgot like a book or something you could call your parents to go get it so you don't get in trouble in class or if your like sick you can call your parents or guardian to bring your medicine because you can't get your medicine in school or if your lost in like a field trip you can call your parents to pick you up and without a phone you'll be lost or get in trouble or and that's why phones in school but i think it should be turned off during class other then that you won't get lose or get busted for not having any supplies but with a phone you won't get lost or miss anything you need for school and that's why i think phones should be allowed in school. and nothing will happen to you but if you have a phone I think you'll good or maybe even if you have tutoring and your mom doesn't show up or forgot you can call her and that's why i think phones should be allowed in school.
