Driverless cars would be a good idea. It would use less fuel, cause less accidents, and there wouldn't be as much traffic. Driverless cars could save many peoples' lives.

Think of it, if a person driving were to get to close to another vehicle the it would stop on its own, preventing the accident. With that preventing the accident, that leads to less traffic. If we had no accidents we wouldn't have as much traffic. The cars would know how to follow all the road signs which would stop all speeding and prevent people from running red lights. Also to all the drunk drivers, that would allow them to not be able to drive drunk. It would be much safer for everyone to have the driverless cars. If you were coming up to a road construction, accident, or traffic the car should let you know atleast five miles ahead of time.

Personally, I think this would be a great way to not use as much fuel, prevent accidents, and traffic. It would make driving so much easier for everyone and not cause as much frustration while driving.
