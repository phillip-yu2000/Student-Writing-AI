I never regretted joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. It was a lifetime oppurtunity, so I accepted. When I was asked, I couldn't say no. It changed my life, and I fully encourage anyone of interest to join.

First of all, we travel all around the world and try so many new things. There is so much more to this world than you think. The Seagoing Cowboys and I got to see all over Europe and China. We even got to spot the Panama Canal on our way to China! We also were able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see the Acropolis in Greece, and tour a castle in Crete! I wouldn't trade anything for those adventures. Anyone can have this experience, after all, I was just a small town boy.

Another reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy is that we have so much fun. During our long voyages, we play lots of games. After unloading the animals, we played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds. To pass the time, we would have table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, whittling, and even reading. We just did so many fun things together, the trips didn't seem to long. Before we knew it, we would arrive at the docks, ready for another journey out to seas.

These journeys were more than adventures, but brand new worlds. If you don't understand what I mean, then you need to. But if you do, You should know exactly what I am trying to tell you. You will experience feelings you have never had before. I love to travel and do new things. This is just my passion, what I was meant for.

In conclusion, I believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy has been a great experience for me, and could be for you too. Mabye this message was for you and inspired you to be a Seagoing Cowboy, mabye it wasn't. It is okay if this didn't convince you to be a Seagoing Cowboy, because I know this job was meant for me, and many of you out there in this world.
