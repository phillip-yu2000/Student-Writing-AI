After school activities are a must, they really are. They can and will change your life in a heartbeat. Instead of sitting at your house eating chips and being lazy, so I think everybody should try to be in some sort of after school activities to get to know people, learn, and most importantly to have fun.

Getting to know your pears is important. If there was an emergency and you needed help it could help your classmates know what to do, to help calm you down possibly. Friendships can help you constantly when your feeling down, left out, and when you think that no one person in the world cares to help you they, your friends,will bring you back up to where they know the real you.

After school activities help you learn sports, tricks, and technology there is always something to learn from them. Down, set, hike this is the sound of a quarterback,that has memorized so many plays to keep track of, it takes so much mental work that it can't just take one day to be good at the position it takes time months, sometimes years to be educated enough. Depending on the after school activity that you choose, it could make a way to be your job someday.

Being good at the activity is only half of it. The other half is having a fun time, if you don't have a fun time whats the point in you doing the activity, maybe you should try a different activity. Find the thing that makes you want to smile and persue that into your activity.

You can have a fun time learning your activity with your friends all at the same time. Once again folks everybody should try to be in some sort of after school activities to get to know people, learn, and most importantly to have fun. That is why I think everybody should be in en extracurricular activity.
