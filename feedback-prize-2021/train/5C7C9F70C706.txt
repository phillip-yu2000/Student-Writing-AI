The Face on Mars were just made from nautral landforms. In my opition I don't really believe in aliens. I will give you reasons to support why and why I think their just nautral landforms.

Some people believe in aliens and that the Face was made by alliens ,because after NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see it caught the attention of people everywhere. The "Face on Mars" became known everywhere. It became featured in Hollywood flims, appeared in books, magazines, and even haunted grocery store check out lines. Who wouldn't believe the Hollywood flims and books? Everyone beliveved and some still believe the films and books. Be carful what you believe. Sometimes it's not true like the aliens.

On April 8, 2001 MGS (Mars Global Surveyor) drew close enough for a second look at the Face and mars. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center of the Face. Malin's team got really good pictures using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. In 2001 each pixel had to be span 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in 1976.

Some people were going over the photos and if there was any kind of objects or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks. You could see it. There is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face.

The Face is a natural landform. I hope you think so now too.
