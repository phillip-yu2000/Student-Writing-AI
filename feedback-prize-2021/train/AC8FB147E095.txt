To Mrs. Principal

I find this idea very smart, but yet unfair. A grade of a C is a average grade. People with a C average should be able to be on the team, but maybe just not play in the games. The students are on the team so they can be able to play in the games. So by not letting them play in the games, they will work hard to bring their average up. Maybe some type of motivation will help them like saying if you get your average up, you will get a week off homework .

Instead of kicking them off the team, give them a little leeway. Just make them sit the bench a couple games and then they will learn to work harder. One reason is because academics come before sports. The students will not have sports when it comes to real life. In order to get a job, you have to be well educated and ready. It doesn't matter how good of an athlete you are, sports won't be there all your life. Another reason is that if the student is trying his very best, you have to consider. The student may not be the brightest kid is the world, but if he is giving the best he can do, second think just kicking him off the team. Doing the best you can in everything is really all that matters. If you can do that, you are in good shape for everyday life.

So my idea to you is that you have to think about what you are doing. I'm not saying that a C average is good, but don't be that hard. Make the student have some more time maybe before practice to get his work done and study a little bit. That will help a lot. Because more than likely, he does not have that much time when he gets home to do homework, depending on the practice time. So that's my advice for you and i hope you use it wisely.

Sincerely,
