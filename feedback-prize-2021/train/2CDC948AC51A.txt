Having a driverless car can have positives and negatives about it. It could help people. It could detect accidents even when the driver isn't paying attention.

Some positives are that there are some drunk drivers out there,but if there was a driverless car they dont have to drive the accident rate would be way down. Another positive is that the disable are able to depend on themselves more. Some negitvies are that the sensors could fail and cause an accident. Some people drive drunk causing accidents but if there was a driverless car then they dont have to drive. Another negitative is that when there is road work and the driver has to take over and he is too drunk to drive. The negitave outlook on the disable driving is that they are not able to drive and then there is and the sensors turn on then the can have an accident and it would be there fault not the manufactors. then there would be a courtcase. There are also cars that can do arrands for disabled Therefore the driverless cars can be a bad thing and a good thing.
