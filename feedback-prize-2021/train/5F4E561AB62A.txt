DEAR PRICIPAL

I feel that it's unfair for you to make that the new policy because some students try their best to get good grads but its just not that easy for most kids to get a A and B because its just not how the get their grades so you say many kids in the school have a C average so maybe you can ask those kids what's so hard about that subject or the work why do you have a C in that class or subject what can i get the teacher to do to get help how is the environment your working in is it to loud, disruptive is it the teacher not paying attenuation or is it you.

Some kids just don't want to do anything in the class so those kids will not get to do sports and activity's or the give the kids with low grades help and then if grades are still bad then yeah its ok to not let them do it but for all of them no its still unfair if they at lest have a C

in the class they can still participate in sports and activity's they just have to try harder but i still think its unfair because as long as their trying there best that's all that matters and then if the kids can bring there grads up so no new policy just new ways to help students bring grades up.
