Have you ever done something alone before, And Just couldn't do it by yourself?

When someone struggles to fix a situation they are in. It's best that they gather information from multiple people

By gaining many opinions you're opening new ideas on how you could do things. You can also make better choices when you gain many perspectives on a situation. When I was younger I had a project to do, And I decided to do it alone cause I was confident I could think of topic and how to write it. Turns out everyone that were in groups were ahead of me while I was still trying to think of a topic. Later when I decided to be with a group they shared ideas on what we will write about and what I will do to benefit the group. Because of their Ideas, And we were able to finish on time.

One time I got myself in a bad situation, And I could not fix the problem, I was struggling to make choice between an event that happened in my life. When I called for help, People gave me opinions why you should do this or not, Later I decided to confront my situation and used the Ideas people gave me.

If I were to stick with what I was thinking previously without any help, The situation would've became more severe, Because of their help though I made a better choice in the actions I should take to fix my own situation.

Doing something alone and sticking with your own Ideas is not as good as getting many ideas from others.

many perspectives of something is more helpful, and you can be more efficient in what you're doing.
