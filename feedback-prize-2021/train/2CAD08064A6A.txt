What would you do if you were forced to participate in an after school activity? I would be really mad because I don't like to stay after school, and I don't want to participate in anything. I'd like to go home and get some rest after using my brain for 7 hours straight. I disagree with this, because I think students shouldn't be forced to participate in an extracurricular activities if they do not want too and some people's families may not even have enough money to pay for thing's they would need for the activities. I think if the principal did this then he would get complaints from the parents of the kids of them not getting the activity they wanted.

One reason I disagree is because, you shouldn't be forced to take anything you don't want to take. Say you chose soccer but they didn't have any room left for you so they moved you into basketball, and you really dislike basketball, How would you feel? Families may not have enough money to buy you equipment for these activities. Finally, I think it should be a choice for students to see if they want to take any of the classes, they shouldn't be forced to take one.
