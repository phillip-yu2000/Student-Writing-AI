I think that we should have more control over the car. like a manual over ride so we could just drive if we dont want to use the automatic mode. the fact that a camera will be watching you kinda bothers me, and they say its for saftey. I dont belive that i think its for people who do drugs, or drink and drive so i guess it would be safer but it would also take away our freedom/choice to drive.

Im still for it cause you would also have more time to pay more attention to others in your car. honestly thats why the camera thing, making sure your watching the road is a bit counter intuitive. You would just be sitting there bacicly looking out a window not to mention people would get board and then you'd definatly get distracted. It even says its on autopilot 90 percent of the time. I hope they redesign the inside of the car, maybe have it to a more liveing room type thing where the driver seat can rotate a 180 degrees to face towards the middle of the car. there would be a adjustable table tv, computer or if you need to face and talk with your kids.

So i think this would help on time crunches and multi-tasking. when you think obout it we spend hours of our day watching signs,roads, and cars. All that time just gone with little progress of anything but now you should be able to get a lot more done in little time, cause time is everything. And we really shouldn't be wasting it on staring at a long lonly road for hours on end.
