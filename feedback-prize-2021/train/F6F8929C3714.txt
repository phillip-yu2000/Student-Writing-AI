Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun, and is earth's neighbor. Venus has a very thick atomosphere, and is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide. This planet can reach tempatures up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists are discussing visits to its surface, but is it safe enough?

No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, its been three decades since a spaceship landed Venus. Conditions on Venus are way worse then here on earth, Venus's environment could crush a submarine, which is capapble of reaching deep into the ocean. Venus's weather is extremely hot, tempatures around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, is still very difficult to survive in, so in Venus there is no chance.

Many scientist observe Venus from a camera that orbits above the planet, but it only provides limited insight, because the atmosphere is very dense. It wil be very expensive to build a machine to land on Venus, just to end up being crushed by this atmosphere. The conditions on Venus makes it uncapable to be studied, and there's no point in studyung it.

The author doesn't support it well.

The author puts in negative ideas into further studying Venus.
