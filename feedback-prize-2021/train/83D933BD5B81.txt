Dear Mr Principal,

I am writing you this letter regarding your decision on making it mandatory for students to perform community service. I myself think that it is sort of a waste of time, depends on what you are going to be doing. If it is something fun then I'll agree on making it mandatory if i have the time, if not then it is a waste of time.

Maybe other students don't think it is but i do because i have many things to do when I get home from school or when i am on break.

If u were to make it mandatory then maybe students might agree if you were too make then do a couple of hours. I don't think that would really bother then that much, but lets say you were to over exaggerate and make then do tons of community service than i would know there reason to be furious. Well bottom of the line is that students should be required to do community service, but to cut them some slack u should mandate them to a whole lot of community service so they wont end up furious. Anyways i hope this letter will aid you with the decision on what you should do. Farwell!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
