community service

STUDENT_NAME

community service is a very good thing to do. it will help you get into colleges, by putting it on your application. however i don't think that people should be forced to do it. people should, but if they don't want to they shouldn't have to. community service involves helping the community with something. for example, it could involve picking up trash, helping raise the flag, or doing natural work. when i say natural work, i mean like helping plant plants. or fixing light post or any thing that is damaged. if there is a tornado and a lot of things are ruined or in critical condition. then you should help. it should feel good when you help people out.

you do not get paid for community service. it is a volunteer job. when you do community service there is usually a policed officer or a fire fighter there with you. they will guide you through what you will need to do. i don't think that principals should make you do it unless it is enforced by the school rules. if you went on a field trip to do community service. you should participate in it. community service could also be a punishment, if you have done some thing wrong. like breaking a law. i don't think that you should be forced to do community service but you definitely should.
