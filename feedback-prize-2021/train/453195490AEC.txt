If my principal was to choose between allowing cell phones or not allowing cell phones at all. I think she should let us have cell phones. I think this policy is better because what if in any case there's an emergency and no ones around that can help, you can use your cell phone. I know teachers and the principal wouldn't want to allow cell phones because it might be a distraction. Well yes maybe sometimes, but there can be a consequence if they are using their cell phone during class. I think it is a good idea to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, because they can entertain themselves and call home just in case your going to stay after school or your going to go to a friends house or something. But if students start abusing the cell phone policy. Then there would have to be no choice but to not allow them at school at all. But first in my personal opinion the principal should give it a try and see what happens. Maybe it will turn out to be a good policy maybe it wont, you wont know if you don't give it a try. Think of it, how come teachers are allowed to have there cell phones during class when they're teaching and sometimes their phone rings and they answer it even during teaching. Or sometimes teachers will be texting during any teaching lessons. How come students aren't allowed, it should be a fair thing too. If teachers bring a cell phone they should have it off during teaching lessons and be able to use it when they aren't teaching or they're on break, us students can have the same policy to let us bring cell phones and use them during lunch or any other free time, because it wont be bothering or disturbing any one if its going to be off during class and we will be using it during our free time. So in my opinion I think the principal should allow students and teachers to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and free times, as long the phones are turned if suring class time.
