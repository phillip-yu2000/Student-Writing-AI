I ,Luke Bomberger, believe that more young men should join the Seagoing Cowboys program beause it is a life changing experiance and because you get to help other nations in need and it also teaches you the true meaning of hardwork. It gives you an amazing oppurtunity to help the world and the people in it.

My first reason hat you should join this program is because it is a true life changing experiance. I got to tour grand castles and see enourmous canals but the most special thing of it all was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. I also got to help a lot of people in need all over Europe and China. Helping these people in need made me more grateful for what I have and it also taught me how to be a better person.

My next reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys progam is because it helps you be more aware of people in other countries and their needs. Im very grateul that I had the opportunity to participate in this program. It relly opened up the world to me. I learned that people in other countries need help during times of war.

My final reason that you should join this program is because you will learn the true meaning of hard work.

I had to clean animal stalls and feed and water all the animals two or three time a day. I also had to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. It may sound miserable bit it kept me very busy during those long days at sea.

I believe more young men this program because it will help you with an amazing oppurtunity.
