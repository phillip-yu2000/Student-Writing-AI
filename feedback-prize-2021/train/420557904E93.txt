Dear State Senitor,

The Electoral College is an ineffeciant way to cast presidential votes.  We the people vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  If we were to change to election by popular vote then the elecions would be truly fair.  After all, it was said by our founding fathers that we the people are who change the government and the face of our nation.  It would lead to more voters and an overall better quality of said electee.

The Electoral college voting system is flawed in many different aspects, such as the chance we take of electing electors that may be biased as much as to betray their pledge and vote for a presidential canidate that you did not vote for them to vote for.  Voters cannot control whom their electors vote for.

The Electoral college is unfair to voters and irration in all.  It is anachronial and non reliable and should be abolished and replaced.
