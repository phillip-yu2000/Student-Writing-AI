To be for or against the delelopment of driverless cars. There are multiple reasons to be for them but also multiple reasons to be against. Myslef i'm against the whole driverless car. In "Driverless Cars Are Coming" it talks about the pros and cons of a driverless car.

Cons of the driverless cars are common sense you will nees a whole lot of sensors which cost a whole lot of money. The driver would still need to be on alert the whole time while driving. Another thing is what if the car just glitchs and there is not enough time for myself to stop. New laws will be coming some will be changing in case of an accident. What if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is a fault the driver or the manufacturer is the question.

In conclusion this is my opinion and my position on "Diverless Cars Are Coming". I just feel like it is a dangerest issue that the world does not need to worry about.
