The picture of what you call "a face" is a rock. It just looks like a face from a birds eye view. The rock just happends to look like a face but if you where there you would just see a rock with some holes. In the text it states "

it's a huge rock which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes , nose , and mouth." In the text it said ILLUSION you know the same thing the do in magic tricks.

They make you think something is happing but its really not. Just like this "face". The shadows make it look like a face with some eyes a mouth and nose. But as you can see that is clearly not hte case.

The text also states that " as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." Which mean that if there where any thing that showed any living organisum living there we would see it.

Since we have not found any proof of living thing on mars yet i would say its safe to say there are no living thing on mars.
