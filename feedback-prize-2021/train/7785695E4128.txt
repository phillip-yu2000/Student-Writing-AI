Dear Principal

I am writing this letter to inform you why requiring all students to perform community service is not a good idea. To start off Community Service according to the constitution is a Responsibility of a citizen not a Requirement, so Therefore Requiring all students to perform community service is unconstitutional, which means you can not do this. Secondly Between Homework Sports and other extracurricular activities some students simply Don't Have The Time to do community service, so if you required all students to do community service it would bring there grades down which would mean our school would drop a grade level. Which would mean less funding which means Less money for the school the staff and you. These Would cause even pourer grades which would cause another grade level drop that would cause us to get less funding and so on. In conclusion Requiring community service will cause our school to drop down from a very good school to a school That no one wants to go to.
