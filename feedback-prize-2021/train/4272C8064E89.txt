Dear , Principal

Well i wanted to touch bases about cell phones in school i know its a problem.

but i was wondering if you could let us use our phones during our free times.

it would reward students of having good grades. Plus i have seen teachers use phones on campus. I mean that is a big issue that teachers use phones.

and we don't. Our school will be really thank that you supported my idea.

Because students must have a responsibility of using there phones or not.

If they use there phones during class will a teacher has a right to take it up. but returning it after class , because some teachers in campus are going threw students privacy.

and that is not good. Students must have the fun on there cell phones in the hallways.

And learn while there in class. it would persuade them to do there work.

I honestly think that it would benefit both you and the students. because students don't have to worried of being caught the time ,teachers don't have to worried of busting a student with a cell phones.

i hope u think about this. cause we think that you are a really nice principal . That should let us use them.

Sincerely ,

Your student
