In this argument I'm going to tell you why the face on Mars, is acually a landform.

On the red planet called Cydonia A.K.A Mars. Twenty five years ago NASA Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars snapping photos of landing sites when they came across a landfrom that looked like a human face. When scientist saw the picture they thought it was just another martian mesa, that is common around in Mars, but it had unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA showed the image for all to see. The caption was "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose, and mouth." They thought it would be a good way to attract attention, but some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization in Mars, although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact. The first image appered on a web site, revealing... a natural landform it was actually a martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landform common around the american west

That was my argument I hope you will take my side that the face was not created by aliens and it was mearly a landform.
