I think it would be a good idea if students cant play any sports or any other activities without having a B grade average. Say if a student had an F or a D how do you expect them to improve there grades if they have practice and things like that. They probably wouldn't have enough time to finish there homework or study for tests or for a pop quiz because they would be to worried about making it to practice or the game that's coming up. So if the students can only play sports with a B grade average more students would probably try to bring there grades up so they can play. I know that boys like to play football and basketball so they would try to bring there grades up the a B average . Girls might not like to play sports so they probably wouldn't care about this so much. But then again some kids might not tryout for the team because they probably don't like to study or do homework so they wont get a B average. The people that really likes to play sports is going to try everything they can so they can play sports. That's why i think students should only be able to play sports with a B grade average.
