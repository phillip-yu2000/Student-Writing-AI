Presidents are leaders that are chosen by the people. Presidents are chosen by the Electoral College. "

The Electoral College is a process not a place" according to the article Does the Electoral College work

?. It consists of 538 electors and a mojority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. So why change it to a popular vote now? I think that we are doing great with the Electoral College.

First of all, I think we should keep the Presidents' election to the Electoral College because the Founding Fathers established it to compromise a vote to elect our leader and we should keep it that way because it has worked for years. In

Source 1: What is the Electoral College it says "

The Electoral College is not a process, not a place. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise

". This is why we shouldn't change process because as soon as we try to change it we would mess up the sequence.

Secondly, wherever there is something good there is something bad. The Electoral College isnt perfect and it has had its flaws so I do think we should use the Popular Vote because of the winner- take-all systems in each state preventing a fair vote. The term " The Bigger they are the Harder they fall" it doesnt work in this part. The bigger the state the bigger the vote. Its unfair because states like Texas the people who they vote for always gets an edge in elections and small states like Mississippi gets small parts in voting.

Lastly, the Electoral College is a better choice because it gives each state a chance to go for who they believe is going to win. Competition is something we all do and we should be able to compete in the sam league no matter how big or how small a state is.
