Dear, Principal

Students should be required to perform community service. A lot of student know that they should but there to lazy and don't feel as if its there responsibility do give back to there community. I for one am one of those lazy students. Students wont give back on there on free time which is why you should make them help the community on a school day. For example, make a field trip to a community center in where student will give back and help. This way students will be more enthusiastic to go because more than half of the school don't want to stay in school. By doing this student will help the community with there friends so they can enjoy themselves better. By giving them the opportunity you will expose them to something they never did before so since its there first time they might like helping out and want to volunteer to come back on the weekend to help the community.

Sincerely Yours,
