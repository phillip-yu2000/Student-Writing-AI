I believe that the author did supprt the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In the story the author talks about many ways we could overcome the risky challenges that Venus has and what could happen if something does go bad. The author also gives good points on how Venus could be a nearest option for a planetary visit. Also how its often referred to as Earth's "Twin", and how Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.

The atuthor talks about how humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus but none of them survived. He also talks about NASA has been working on other approaches to studying Venus, like a silicon carbide has been tested in caber simulating the environment of Venus's surface. It has lasted for three weeks in that type of conditions. If they keep testing and fixing or inproven the project then they maybe one day make a another one that can surive that type of environment and get the researchers the samples they need to learn more about Venus.

The author does support on how Venus is a worthy to study despite the dangers it comes with. The author talks about the cons about Venus but he also talks about how NASA can overcome themn by making and researching machines that can last long enought to understand the type of environment Venus has.
