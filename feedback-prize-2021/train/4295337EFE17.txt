Dear Principal

You should take Policy 1 because we work hard in school and we would love a little free time and put them away when we are in class or in the hall ways. Policy 1 is better for us because we have some thing to do on our lunch. Policy 2 is not good for us because if we are in class we cant focus because all we are thinking about is our phone and how we cant wait to use it. If we have policy 1 we could focus better and class and do our work better then when we have our break we wont be thinking about using our phone. But I kind of disagree because if we have our break and we are done with using our phone some people disobey the teacher and use their phones in class or when they are suppose to put their phones in their locker use them during any time the teacher is not looking so I kind of agree with Policy 2. I think you should pick Policy 2 because I could not stand not using my phone for more than 6 hours.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
