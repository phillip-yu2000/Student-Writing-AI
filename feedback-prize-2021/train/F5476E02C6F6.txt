The Seagoing Cowboys program changed my life. It opened me up to new experiences and opportunities. That is why I believe other people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program too. Here are some reasons why I believe you should also join along.

First of all by joining you get to help those in need. While I was a Seagoing Cowboy we had to care for a country's animals that were shipped overseas. Which was an amazing experience for a small-town boy like me, which surely this would be a great experience for you too. Another example is that you get to visit many different places. Once I was able to see Europe and China, even Acropolis, Greece. Also I got take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. It was an amazing experience that you would feel almost everyday if you joined the program. May I add you will have fun? Once when we took return trips, after the animals been unloaded, we would play baseball and volleyball in the empty holds where the animals were housed. We also would play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and even play games to pass the time. It was a fun time.

These are my examples of why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Surely, if you join you will be open to new experiences and opportunities as I was. I hope you take these reasons in consideration and join, I bet it'll be an opportunity of a lifetime!
