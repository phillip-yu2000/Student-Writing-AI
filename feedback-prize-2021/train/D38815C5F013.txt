Dear Principal,

I think that policy #2 should be set. School is a place where students should go and learn not use phones and be distracted.

Maybe our school says yes to using phones then who are you supposed to text or call? Your mom or dad? That's the thing, you have no reason to use your phone. What if you leave it on a table during lunch and someone steals it? Or maybe your sitting outside with your friends and you loose it. You don't want to have to face the consequences from your parents.

Another reason is your education. Being a student I know what other student would do if you gave them the privilege if having it during the day. Sure you'll tell them to turn it off but think about it, do you honestly think they would? Backing up that is the fact that a student could be texting during class. And once they start, they wont stop. Pretty soon they would have missed the whole lesson, and that wont be fun when a test or their report cards come home. A student could miss the tardy bell because they were too interested in texting their friend.

Setting the first policy, is setting the start for a child's failure in any subject. Say your a principal and also a parent, would you want your child to fail because they wanted to text their friends saying "What's up?" No parent wants their child to fail, and no principal should either.

Sincerely,

A student that doesn't want to fail or her friends to fail.
