Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet and taking pictures. It cam across a picture that looked like a human face. Scientis then studied it for a while and said it was not a sign of life on Mars that it was just the way a landform in Mars was shapped. They then send it out to the people. The people start freaking out because they have the idea on thier minds that Mars might actually have life for us to live in.

On April 5, 1998 the MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. The photos proved that on Mars there was only landforms. Many people were unsatisfied with the new photos. In paragraph 8 it says, "Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. Mission conrollers looked again. On April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day on Cydonia Malin's team captured an extradinaryphoto using the camera's absolut mazimum resolution. On the picture it indetinfied that Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

In conclusion the photos the viking's took are not the face of anything. It is an ordinary photo of Mars landforms. Which were not 100% idenfied untill April 8,2001. Which proves that the photos are just landforms of Mars.
