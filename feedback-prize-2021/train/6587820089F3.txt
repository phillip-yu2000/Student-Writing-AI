Ring! Ring!

Thats the school's bell to tell the students to go to there next class. At school students can learn important life traits but, now there is home school. Students can stay home and learn from online. Students can even attend some classes with video conferencing. Homeschooling is going to benefit students because there isn't as much pressure and if a student can't attend school do to a illness, they can just video conference the school.

Pressure. No matter where someone goes there is still going to be pressure on them. At school, students have to do test and homework. It can get to the point to where the students don't want to go to school anymore. With homeschooling, students stay in their home and can feel more comfortable and can work better. Students can set aside sometime every day and get the work done. It would be more efficient way for students to learn. Students can even have the possibility to graduate early. Students wouldn't have to worry a bout a lot of pressure at home.

Students walk and talk in between classes. But, what if a student couldn't walk or talk. Students like this usually have to go to some special school that cost a lot of money. Homeschooling can let the student stay home and work. They can even have a video conference with a school so that their involved in school. This way they can work and make friends. Also, it can help teach them a bout the real world and how it is. Homeschooling is also a lot less expensive. The parents wouldn't have to pay the school a ridicules amount of money and don't have to pay for food.

Homeschooling. It can help a lot of people everywhere. All a student needs is a laptop or computer and internet. Homeschooling is probably going to be the next generation. It is more efficient at teaching students and it doesn't give but to much pressure on students. With homeschooling, we could benefit all the students in the world!
