To my fellow principal,

Your consideration of changing the school policy so that students may not participate in any sports or in any activities unless they have at least a grade B average, in my point of view I think that all students should be able to participate in any sports/activities once so ever. You changing the school policy could cause many problems with the health of the children that don't have a B average or above. It can cause health problems because the children will become inactive, meaning that they will become lazy and not care for there own health. They might eat more than they usually do, eating more junk food than their fruits and vegetables. That can increase their weight and can increase the chance of a heart attack.

I also think it's unfair to let other students play while the other students watch them and sit inside doing work. But in the other hand the students that do receive a B average or higher should deserve a little price saying "good job" for their hard work and effort. And for the students that don't receive a good average, I think their teachers should try to motivate them to try even harder to boost their grades up, and when they do get to a B average or higher they will receive a prize too like the other students.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that changing the school policy so that students may not participate in any sports or in any activities unless they have at least a grade B average or higher, is unfair and unhealthy to the students. Let all the students of the school participate in sports so that they can be active at all times, motivate the students to get better grades in school, and also by saying "Good Job!" with a smile and a small prize.
