There are many advantages to limiting car usage. For example, to decrease stress, to decrease pollution, to manage your time and communication better, and to avoid traffic. The reason I feel most strongly about limiting car usage is to decrease stress.

First, many people that driving can cause a lot of unneeded stress. In the first article "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Heidrun Walter says "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way." Families or even individuals exercise and get out and communicate a lot more in my opinion when they aren't riding around in a car. Traffic also causes a lot of stress.

Second, pollution is beginning to be a very big deal that can't be fixed, only stopped. The first article states that "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intencive areas in the United States." In the second article "Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog" by Robert Duffer I learned that Paris enfored a patial driving ban to clear the air of the city. The smog went down by 60 percent.

To conclude, I believe that there are many advantages of limiting car usage for reasons like stress, pollution, traffic. There are many reasons that car usage should be managed and in my opinion stopped.
