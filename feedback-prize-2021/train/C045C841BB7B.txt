There are too many problems driveless cars could bring up with the law. There are too many saftey issues that could happen with driveless cars. So, are driveless cars really coming?

As of today there are no completly driveless cars out. There are only cars that can assist with driving. It will be awhile before driveless cars are out on the roads. Even cars that are just assisting are not safe. Assisting cars are very limited in assisting for saftey reasons.

What happens if a driveless car gets into an accident, is it the dirvers fault or the manufacter? This could bring up many legal problems. There would be many lawsuits against the manufacturing companies. Also, the laws would have to change for driveless cars.

A lot of people would assume that their car is in control, so most likley many of them would not pay attention to the road. Many accidents would happen this way. Putting cameras in cars to asssure that people are paying attention to the road would be an invasion of privacy.

Driveless cars may be a thing of the future. Driveless cars are not a thing of today. Too many legal issues would arise. Driveless cars bring too many saftey issues. No, driveless cars will not be coming anytime soon.
