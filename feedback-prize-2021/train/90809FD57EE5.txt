Good afternoon, Mr. or Mrs. state senator.

I am writting this letter to you in regards of trying to persuade you to help change the election of the president of the United States. For many years,

we the people

, have fought our way towards freedom, and your assistence has been with us for a very long time, but if we the people have managed to fight for our freedom, than I beleive that we also have the power to choose our president. We can't just have a president based on congres's opinion, we all have different opinions. That is why we all stand as one and decide who we vote for. Instead of having 270 people vote for our president, why dont we have thousand's of people vote for our president.

We decide what is good and bad for us, not congress

. Many people ,ie Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have all agreed on to abolish the electoral college. As the passage say, in 1960 segregationist nearly succeded in replacing democratic  electors with new ones. that means the they might have despise Kennedy, one of our most succesful presidents. After all, the electoral college is unfair to voters, besides the electoral college is pretty old. We are living in the future, where we learned from our ancestors mistakes not just about life but also about politics.  Most people consider the electoral colege as outdated or as an anchronism. By YOU helping US, we could abolish the electoral college.

Thank you for your time from PROPER_NAME
