Dear, principal

I Know that many students are at a C average but changing the policy to have at least a B average is to high. I think that the fair average is C and can not participate in sports if they have lower than a C average. I think that you are putting it one more grade average higher because there to many people playing activities but the are not doing good in there grades so in order to help them the most is by changing the policy.

If its in that case then i agree because school work should go first than any activity or sport. I can understand where she is coming from . If i was the principal at that school i would probably do the same thing so the students can understand that school is serious that more people need to get there grades up so i agree to the change in the policy the principal is changing.
