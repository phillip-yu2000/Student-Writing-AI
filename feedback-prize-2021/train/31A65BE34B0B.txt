Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Yes I believe that we should have to perform community service. Helping the community is very important. Doing community service can help you understand that your community needs you. It is also a great experience to be able to do community service. As long as you choose something that is important to you, you will enjoy it. Lastly, having the opportunity to do community service can really help you figure out what you may want to do with your future.

To begin with, community service is a good lesson to learn that your community needs you. Having the opportunity to do community service I have learned many things. I have learned that my community needs me. Maybe if its only picking up trash once a week at the park. It still helps and then hopefully you will learn that you shouldn't litter because eventually someone has to pick it up.

Another reason why community service is important is that it is also a great experience. Without being able to do community service you don't know how your community is. For example if you tutor kids you will maybe learn that some kids need more help than others and you have to be patient.

Lastly, doing community service can really help you find out what you might want to do in your near future. Maybe if you teach kids how to read you might find out that you will like to be a teacher. You also get to learn little skills like patience. To teach little kids how to read you have to be patient with them.

In conclusion, having the opportunity of doing community service can help you a lot. It can help you understand that maybe when you get older your community needs you. It also is a great experience to be able to do community service. Finally community service may let you know what you might want to do when you get older. This is why I feel like community is a very important part of a students education .
