Limiting car usage would be great for people in a big city, not so much the country. It would be good for people in the city because everything is right beside each other and if it wasn't you can have taxis so it saves gas. Its also good to cut down on car usage because it will make us healthier. If we don't drive all the time its better for the environment.

The first reason for cutting back on car usage is because everything is right beside each other in a city. There is no reason to waste the gas to drive right down the road. In the country its different because it may be a small town yes, but everything may be 15 to 20 miles away. And we don't have taxi's or buses.

Have you ever thought about walking everyday to school or work? Everybody would be in great shape! We would walk everywhere and if you're running late then you will most likely fast walk which is even better. People would start eating better because they would get cramps walking to work, they would start exercising more. Even if they didn't like walking to school or work they would have to so they wouldn't have a choice but to exercise.

We harm the environment everyday with the cars we drive. Why not just stop using cars so we can help our planet and maybe make it a better place to live? All it would take is you walking a couple blocks to school, work, or the store and that would already be helping us.

The thing is people today are so selfish and take everything for garnet. The things we could accomplish if we only cut back a little bit. Just save gas, if you are going to the store that is two blocks away, don't call a taxi, don't crank your car up, just walk there. People would be so much healthier if they walked everyday, and we would help the environment. I'm not telling you to start being a tree huger or anything, just think about it. Would you rather live in a polluted environment or a healthy one? The choice is yours.
