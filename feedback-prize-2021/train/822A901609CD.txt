Dear principal

I believe that policy one is the better chose.

Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.

the main reason why is because some people play sports or after school activity's as tutors or something like that.

So lets say that your playing foot ball and forgot to let your mom or dad someone like that know you had to stay after school. you need to call your parents and let them know about that or if not and you where not on the bus your parents will get worried and all that. so to prevent something like that happening you would instead go with policy one. this will probably prevent any thing like this to ever happen.

Now i will also give one more freak example of why i think number one is the best. So you are in gym and someone trips you and you fall and break your leg. So now the school has to call the parents and tell them but wait the number got changed so you cant and don't have any way to contact the parent. billy bob phone has mommy's number. So if you when with policy two mom would never know but with policy one just cheek his book bag and get the phone and call.

This is why i think and know policy one is the best.
