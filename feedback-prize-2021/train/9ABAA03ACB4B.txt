Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I personally feel rethinking the policy of having cell phones in school is a great idea. In my opinion, having cell phones at school would be a privilege. I have came up with two reasons why having cell phones at appropriate times should be a school policy.

First of all, in this generation having a cell phone with you is a must. You always see teens with cell phones. Teens and cell phones are like alcoholics and alcohol.

You can't keep them apart, or they become a mess. Teens are addicted to cell phones. Even when they're not suppose to use their cell phones, they do it anyways. Giving them the privilege to use their phones at school at appropriate times could increase the number of students that get in trouble because of their cell phones.

Secondly, cell phones could help in case of emergencies. During an emergency you can't always reach a telephone. If teens could have cell phones at school getting in touch with a family member wouldn't be a problem. Announcing on the intercom the appropriate time when to get in touch with a family member could help out a lot.

In conclusion, you changing the policy to, "yes students can use their cell phones at appropriate times" could make an impact on the school. You can always make more exceptions to the policy for those who don't abide by it. I hope you take my letter into consideration, and that my reasons why we should have cell phones in school makes an impact. Thank you for your time and patience.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
