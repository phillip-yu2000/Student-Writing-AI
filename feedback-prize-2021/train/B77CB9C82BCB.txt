I think Policy Two, the policy stating that students are not allowed to use phones at school at all, is a safer and better policy than Policy One. Cell phones are used to communicate with friends. Why is there a need to communicate with your friends over the phone if you are already with them at school? If students were allowed to use phones during their free time, they might use the phones for ways other than communication with their friends. Some negative ways students could use their phones are: communicating with friends about the answers to tests without a teacher hearing them, or calling their parents to come pick them up from school. If cell phone usage was banned completely, principals and teachers would not have those problems.

If cell phones were allowed during free time, students would have more of an urge to use phones at inappropriate times like during class. Banning cell phones from school would disable students from having cell phones in class. Though as a student, I believe having my phone at school would be fun, I still think that phones at school could cause many problems. In conclusion, Policy Two is a better policy because it prevents many issues in school.
