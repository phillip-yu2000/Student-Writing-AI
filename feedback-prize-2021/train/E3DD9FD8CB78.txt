Have you ever participated an extracurricular activity? Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it could help with improving sport skills, getting your homework or any other assigned work from school done early, or having tutor for an upcoming test or quiz.

Playing sports is not something we all like. However, it is something that most of us would like to learn how to play. For example, my favorite sport is soccer but lets say I'm not that good at it. Therefore, I would need to participate in an extracurricular activity that focuses on how to get better at soccer. You can also try new sports that may look interesting to you.

Another thing that extracurricular activities help with is doing your assigned homework. Since most of us don't like doing homework, mostly because they take up our free time, most of us would like some more time and help with homework. The same goes with pretty much any other school work like projects .As a result, you will get your school work done early and won't have to worry about it at home.

Tutoring can help us for an upcoming test or quiz. It can also help us with understanding things we were struggling to understand before. For example, I'm struggling to learn how to multiply polynomials. Therefore, I would participate in an extracurricular activity with tutoring for algebra. As a result, I would be able to pass my test on the multiplying polynomials.

78.75% of students would like to participate in extracurricular activities. Do you agree with participating in an extracurricular activity?

I agree to participate in extracurricular activities because it can help me with things I have a hard time understanding, help me improve with things I already know, and help me save time from doing school work at home or any other place.
