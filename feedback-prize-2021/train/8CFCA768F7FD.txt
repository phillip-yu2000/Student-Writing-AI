Dear State Senator

People should make a better choice on who they pick as president. Some people choose wrong, and the electoral collage needs to vote for us so that they make the right choice. The only reason I think this is because the electoral collage has never let us down.

I like that we have some one to vote for us.

Senator take this to heart we need this process for the people and the government. The only reason I like the process is because I would choose somebody over what they say not over what they do. I belive that some one should be picked as of their history and manners and honesty not over popular vote.

This process is the only process that they need to help us make the right choice. The right choice would be Obama or Kinnedy or some one like that. The wrong choice is that charlie chris who wants to be a governor, well for now he wants to be a governor next he will want to be a president. The process of electoral collage needs to be here.

The only reason we need not to vote on the popular voting thing is because people vote wrong vote right for once huh. Come on the voting thing where we vote and the popular vote wins isn't right out of however many presidents we've had we've only got under a half of them right. We need this process for the same reason we need new presidents lately.

Do you see why we need not to vote by popular vote now? We need to stick to the electoral collage process or we won't be in good hands with presidents that is. Don't make us go back to popular vote thing please. We don't need popular voting at all so thats all i have to say.
