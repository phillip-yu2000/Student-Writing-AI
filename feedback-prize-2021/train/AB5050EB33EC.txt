Dear state senator i would like to argue the Electoral college, wheather to keep it or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Honestley i would like to get rid of it because there are so many things wrong with it, even the best-liad defenses are wrong because our vote does not really count the popular vote could be voting for one of the president while the representative that represents us could choose to vote for the other president if he wanted. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a straight up election to the kind we have now. For example take in consideration what happened the year 2000 when Al Gore was going against George. W Bush, Al Gore had won the popular vote which means that everybody wanted Al Gore to be president. But George. W Bush won the whole election because of the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College system the voters are not voting for the president, but for a slate elctors,they decide who the president is. Which if you think about it its un american because this is a free country and a democracy and if we are not realy picking but just mearley helping decide who is president in a democracythen yeah my opinion is that its un american. What most worries the people is the prospect of the tie in the elctoral college which in that case the votes will be sent to the House of Representatives where they choose the president which if you think about its bad because lets say that the HR is being governed by Republicans and you the voter is a Democrat, which way do you think the HR is going to go, Republicans right, and how would that make you feel, not very pleassent i assume. The Electoral College is a prcess not a place which means we can demolish it without getting people hurtthats why i propose that we crush the Electoral College hopefully all the information i've put in this letter has pursuaded you to help out your country.
