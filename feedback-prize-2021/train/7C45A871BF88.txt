No matter how safe you are you csn always make a mistake. If you take your eyes off of the road ever for a split second ypu csn cause a major car accident. My position on driverless cars is that they are affective and needed.

If you go on a road trip through several states your legs tend to start cramping or start to hurt, if we had autopilot cars then you could give our legs a break from driving and relax while the car does all of the work. In the Google's modified Toyota Prius it has a video camera mounted nea the rearview window, thisway if a little kids ball rolls behind your car while you are backing up you can see the child and not injury them or possibly kill them. In the BMW "Trafic Jam Assistant" the car is designed to sterr, accelerate, and brake itself but it still needs a driver to have their hands on the sterring wheel. This means that the human driver must remain alert especially around work zones and around accidents. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver, meaning that the driver still has to be alert while driver but if something happens the car could stop itself keeping everyone in the car safe.

Driverless cars are going to happen soon. Automakers including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are planning on having cars that can drive themselves within the next 4 years. If we have autopilot cars then it would give us a whole new feel on driving. Sometimes change is a good thing.
