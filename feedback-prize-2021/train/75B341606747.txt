I believe that you should only have your phones out while you are at lunch and they should be off while teachers are talking. i think this because kids do need something fun to do for lunch and also it could stop them from being bad in the class room. i think it will stop them from being bad in the class room because they would have had something to do and pay attention because they had so much fun at lunch. also i do not think they should have there phone out in class because that means that people will get distracted and the person with the phone out will not learn anything.

But i do think that it is a good idea to have the phones out at lunch because they are not learning anything at lunch time they are only eating. so i do not see the big deal of eating and texting but i do see the big deal with texting in the classroom because that stops you from learning. Also about phones off in the class room i think you should be able to keep them on but the sound all the way off so it does not beep or anything. but i think you should be able to have it on because if there was a fire and you needed to call your mom right away to pick you up then that is pretty important.

so i do agree with the first one because how much harm can a kid do with texting and eating lunch. so you might think that it is a bad idea and go with what you want but i really do think that there will be no harm done if you allowed them to get there phones out for lunch. also if you let them come to lunch with phones they will be more willing to not take there phones out during class
