Phones and Driving

People shouldn't use their phones while driving because now people are getting killed by people driving while using their phones. Over the years drivers haven,t been paying attention to the road ever since social media have been created.

So now Gwinnett County made a law so that drives can't use their phone to prevent death rate from increasing in the county. With today's technology cars will now allow you to call people through the car's bluetooth settings. And if we need a gps we can also input on the cars gps. Even though you can do all of this stuff now you still need to watch where you're going and the speed limit so you don't risk other people's lives because of how fast your driving.

Even today neighborhoods are have kids getting hit on the side of the road just because your not watch the road, but instead texting while your driving. I even watch people look at their phones even if nobody's around you can still injure you and the passengers in the vehicle. Done the street on my way to my uncle's house there's a sign with gifts all because someone was texting on their cell phones. And hit the car she was in and caused a wrecked leaving one dead and two injured all because that person was texting while he was driving.
