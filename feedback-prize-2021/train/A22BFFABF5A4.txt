Cars polut the environment so a couple governments banned them. the bennifits of banning cars are actually better than some one would think. An advantage to banning cars is less polution, less clutter in the street and a happier life.

Less polution is great especially with all of the machines running now adays. polution causes holes to from in the atmosphere, the atmosphere is what hoilds in the air we breath. The atmosphere also plays a much larger role in our way of life. Ever heard of the word global warmming? Well itws because the earths outside temerature is hotter then what it should be, because there are holes in the ozone layer. The ozone layer is like insulation in your house it keep cold air in on hot summer days. most polution comes from cars alone just because they are used so much byt everyone.

Having less clutter in the streets is always a good thing. Having less cars will lead to less accidentrs and less fatalities. People will not worry as much and it'll cause less stress. with having less cluttered streets that means more people will be walking by stores and resteruants, which leads to more buisness for store owners.

living a happy life in very important. I believe that if your not happy then your not living right. Banning cars reducess stress and stress mAKES PEOPLE UN HAPPY AND NOT LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST.
