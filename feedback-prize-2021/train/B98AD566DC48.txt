Everyone has their opinion about the Electoral College, but does everyone look into it and get all the information they need about it before jumping to conclusions? Truth is, there are some who just assume they know everything about the Electoral College to make a decision. Then there are those who do research and look into the facts.

Under the electoral college system, voters don't even vote for the president they actuallyÂ  vote for a slate of electors that elected that president. In source 2, it states that the single best arguement against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The statement is that American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system we have now is said to allow for something much worse than that.

Although many people despise the Electoral College, there are also some good reasons to keep this method of choosing the President stated in Source 3. Some of the reasons are certainty of outcome, no trans-regional appeal, and avoiding run-off elections. These are just three reasons despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.

The Electoral College is looked at as a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The most worrying thing that could possibly happen is a tie in the electoral votes. If this was to occur, the election would be taken over by the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the President.
