Is the Face on Mars real? In my opinion the Face on Mars is real. Here are my reasons why.

The Face on Mars is real because it can be a natural landform on Mars just like we have natural landforms on Earth. Now may I ask a question? How can ailens make a face on Mars? In the picture provided, it seems the face pops out and there is no evidence that a creature could have made a face with no flaws. In the article, a webiste states " thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform."

I understand that people may have a theory about the face, but hence the word theory. Theory is just a guess with evidence supporting the claim, but is there enough evidence to support the Face? People from NASA have studied the Face since it first appeared in 1976. Since then, people have found claims and have had facts about the face proving it is just a natural landscape.

How did the face appear? There can be many reasons on how the face appeared on Mars. There could have been a storm on Mars that caused the ground to move upright and form the Face. The face could have been on Mars since Mars was created and NASA just never payed enough attention until 1976. I do not believe an ailen created the Face on mars.

Is the face on Mars real? Keep that question in your head. I believe this essay has provided enough evidence proving the Fac on Mars is just a natural landform. That's just my opinion. What's your opinion?
