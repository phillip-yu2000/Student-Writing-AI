Is the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom valuable? I think it is valuable becuase in paragraph six line six it states that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." In that case the lesson could be modified to be more intresting.

Computers that can read human emotions just from their faces can apeal to humans more. If you see something you like and smile it will show you more of that. Students could have a more emotional conection with computers. In paragraph six line ten it says "Most human communtication is nonverbal, including emotional communtication...So computers need to understand that, too."

To students it would almost be like having a teacher in the room instead of a computer. Having technology read emotional expressions is valuable because it would be able to read facial featchers better than a human. It would be able to know if you happy if you raise your lips at the corners of your mouth or squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes. The technology can even see more than more emotion like in the Mona Lisa. Paragraph one line one states "Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."

Overall I believe technology to read the emtionsl expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It can help students be more intrested in their lesson.
