Dear Principal,

I think policy 1 will be the best one because what if one of their relatives were in a accident such as a car accident. They need to know about important things like that. If They need to call there parents for something I think they should be allowed to do that. Students should be allowed to use there phones at lunch periods and at other free times. Some people might think it should not be allowed because phones are a distraction. On the other hand the phones are turned off so they cant get any calls or text. If the school is closing early because of a tornado, or hurricane, or earthquake. Students should be able to call there parents so they can come and pick them up from school if its during lunch or at free times. Students should not get their phones out during class and disrupt class. Students are getting lucky to bring their phones to school. You should not be allowed to have your phone in study hall if you have homework or need to study for a test because it will distract you. So that's why I think policy one is the best just because there might be a emergency.

Sincerely,

Student
