Dear, school principal

I've heard that you are considering a new policy for students to use cell phones. I think that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school. since you are the principal I think that you should try it out first and see how every student behaves when they have their cell phones.

In my opinion students should be allowed to bring in their cell phones to school. If they bring them in to the school then i think that they would be getting into less trouble .You may be wondering that how would they get into less troble, well the answer is simple. If you allow the students in our school than they wouldn't have to sneak in their phones. Sneaking their phones into the school would get kids into trouble easily.

Have you ever got worried because a person that is always calling you is not calling you no more? Maybe its because that person had an emergency and did not call you because she was in a place where no cell phones were allowed.

If students get to use their cell phones during their lunch period or in any other free time than they would be able to check their lost calls and their messages. They would contact their parents whenever they don't feel well. They would also be less worried knowing that everybody in the family is in good health conditions.

I think that students should really have their cell phones at all times. they should use them only in free periods and not while being in class. You should really think about it and see how it all works out.

Yours truly,
