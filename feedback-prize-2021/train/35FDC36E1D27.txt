When you ask for advise, what do you do? You don't just ask a single person, you ask multiple. This can be helpful when needing a answer you understand, an answer without bias and an answer that is correct.

When you ask for help, you need an answer that you understand. If you don't understand the answer to a problem, you don't have an actual answer. If you talk to multiple people, they will answer you in different ways, giving you more angles to look at the problem and understand it. You have a better chance at solving the problem, if you know the answer to it.

If you ask one person on a topic, most of the time, they will give you a biased answer. Biases can have misleading information and only share their side of the story. To avoid bias, you can talk to many people about it to get multiple opinions. That way, you get both sides of the story and can form your own opinion about the subject.

Lastly, if you were to ask someone a question, the person could give you the wrong answer. No one knows everything, so when you ask someone a question, you aren't always given the correct answer. To solve this, you ask different people on the same topic. This way, when you need a answer, you are most likely to get the correct one.

When asking multiple people on a topic, question, opinion, etc. you will get better results than with just one person. You understand the solution more, avoid bias and get the correct answer more often. This is why you should ask for multiple people's help.
