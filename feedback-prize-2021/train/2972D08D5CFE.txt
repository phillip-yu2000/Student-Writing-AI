In the classroom you get bored of one subject and your teacher just doesnt be quite and your tired of that subject. If you were on your computer you wouldnt have that problem because with the new advanced software it would be able to recognize your bored so it would change the subject. This could be a very effective equipment for a person that cant go to school or someone that does online school. It could really change or make a diffrence how people learn and what to do to make people learn better.

This could help someone out a lot when they are in home schooled and they get bored or are getting tired of that subject the software could read his facial expression and change what subject they are on. In the text it says " they can tell when somone is happy, surprised, angry,disgusted, scared, or sad." This could help a lot because sometimes people wont be ahving the best of days and then you could tell what was wrong with just a picture of there face during that time.

This is why I think the software that reads your expresion would be good in the classroom. Instead of wondering what is wrong with a kid when he or she is doing his or hers work just read there facial expertion and understand maybe they arent having the best of days. Also when your online and your taking a course online it can tell when you get bored so the technology can change the course your on so it wont be as boring because you would switch it up every now and then. This tool could help out a lot in the classroom expeience but aslong as its not always looking through your camarea because that could be going through our privacy.
