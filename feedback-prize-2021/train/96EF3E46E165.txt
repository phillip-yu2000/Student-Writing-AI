our school is made up of many school averages. When i heard that my principal was considering that b averages was the only way you could play a sport i was very surprised at the news. There are many reason why the principal shouldn't do this because many kids that's all they look forward to in school, they make get averment's with there sports, and they have great talents in there sport. Have you ever thought about it that way before?

first, many students think about getting out of school so they think about what they will do after, some students will text, watch tv,or what they would do a sport they love that makes them feel open and free and not have to worry about any of the small things that get to them like school,drama,and problems at home. i think ever students should be able to have the opportunely to be free and open in ever little thing they do wirthery they have a B average to.

many kids that i see make great averment's in there sports. they sportsman ship awards,fca awards they can get chiocoin to be the team captain those things change people in many ways so they could be like i am not doing so hot in school maybe i should care more about my school work and my sports. Their coach's influences them in many ways to the try for there goals in life and they want them to be a good player and a good academies student as well.

many students that i seee have get talnet in vereything they do i dot think that she school should be able in anyway to do that because if that was the case most all the students at my school wouldn't be in the sport. alot of talnet was natural and comes naturely so the school admester will never evre have the otherity to take that away from anyone.

so i hope next time the principal ever thinks about doing thid i hope they sit and think abiut the out come of there time and school.
