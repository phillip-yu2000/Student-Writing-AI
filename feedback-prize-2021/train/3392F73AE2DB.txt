Don't you think students would be happier if they participated in a extracurricular activity? Playing a sport or serve on the student council or even working on the year book are some of the extracurricular activities a student can participate in. Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it would take students minds off of school work and its healthier for them.

My first reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it would take students minds off of school work. School can be very stressful and sometimes students just need to get away from all the test and homework. Participating in a extracurricular activity can help a student feel more relaxed and not worry about school that much. Students might even focus more in school and do better on there test.

My second reason why I think students should at least participate in one extracurricular activity is because it's healthy for students. Students won't be as moody or stressed out. Being stressed out might affect the student and they might feel overwhelmed and not want to try in school. By participating in a activity like a sport or other activities it can help students not feel so stressed out or overwhelmed.

To wrap it all up, students should participate in extracurricular activities because it can help them take there mind off school work and its healthy for them. School can be stressful and students might feel overwhelmed by it.

This is why I think students should participate in a extracurricular activity.
