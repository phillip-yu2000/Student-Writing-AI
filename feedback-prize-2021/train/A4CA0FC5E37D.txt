Driving to some people is time consuming and boring. Imagine if you had a personal assistant or even your own private taxi service. That service could take you where ever you want and you dont even have to drive.

You could take a nap or catch up with friends, even enjoy a nice meal before you start work. Some people who work late shifts and even start early in the morning would prefer sleeping then driving to get to thier job in the morning. Well maybe one day, but that day could come sooner than you know it.

Movies, Television, Art and much more have inspired the creation of new tech. This includes self driving cars; ever sence 2009 the trails of making a self driving car comes to life. With test from google and BMW working with new tech to advance cars to be self driven. Some say that this is a great idea but others would disagree. With new tech comes a lot of software and coding one wrong thing could lead to injury and even death. This is why people would rather not have a self driving car out on the road.

Driving out on the road is not a toy or game when going at 60 miles an hour,

any thing could happen. This is why cars that can drive them selfs are not available to the public. Many test are still being done and even though there isn't a self driving car out on the streets yet; there are still cars with new tech intalled from the test. Cameras, motion sensors and alerting systems are beginning to be more comin. Dangerous enough when you don't see something out in front of the street and possibly hit it; a sensor could prevent that or a alert that lets you see it before any thing happens.

So even though we don't have self driving cars out on the road we do have some sort of tech that comes close to it. Sooner then later could you see a car that drives it slef but for the mean while its always better to be safe then sorry.
