Luke said he grew up on an farm with his aunt so he wanted to help the animals. After World War 2 Luke wanted to help the countries recover by bringing food supplies and animals. Luke loved animals because when he was younger he had lived on a farm. So when he heard UNRRA is hirring Seagoing Cowboys to take care of Horses,Cows,and Mules he and his friend Don signed up. This to Luke this was an opportunity of a life time.

Luke got on an boat called SS Charles W. Wooster and there were 335 Horses plus hay and oats to feed the Horses. When Luke was 18 he could be drafted to be in the military but when they heard he was on a cattle boat trip they told Luke to stay. In 1947 Luke made nine trips the most out of any Seagoing Cowboy. Luke said "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special,"he says.

If you get to go on this trip you would be busy but you would have so much fun. Also if you like caring for people and animals you would be perfect for this journey. Another reason is if you like travling on a boat and don't get sea sick you should try being a Seagoing Cowboy or girl. Not only that but you could become famous just for helping people. Then again you should always help people. Luke went would you?
