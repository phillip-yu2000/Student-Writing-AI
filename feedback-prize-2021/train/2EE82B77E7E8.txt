I believe that the electoral college should be taken away because presidents that have won the popular vote have lost the election due to the electoral college and to me that just does not seem right "Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"(source 2 Plumer 9). If it was not for the electoral college Gore would have won the election. If this country really is a government by the people and for the people then the government would get rid of the electoral college.

The electoral college is very outdated it has been in use sense the founding fathers made it "The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise" (source 1 OFR paragraph 1). it might have worked well back then but now it is outdated it has been three hundred years since it has been changed and it simply does not work that well anymore.

If there was no winner take all system it might just be a little more fair "the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all-system" (source 2 Plumer paragraph 13). Candidates do not even give every state a chance they usually just skip the state that they know they will not win over "candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"(source 2 Plumer paragraph 13).

That is why iI think the electoral college should be taken out it is outdated, and it is unfair. If this country was really run by the people than the people would really get to pick the president. Those are my only really big issues with the electoral college, but that does not mean that I do not want to see it go.
