In my opinion I think the Seagoing Cowboys was a wonderful experience. I was asked by my good friend Don to join and I thought why not. This would be a great opportunity to interact with people in need and travel around the world. I automatically signed up.

We started our expedition in August of 1945. I got to see many places during the program. That included a gondola ride in Venice, an Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and much much more. This program is excellent if you aren't a very worldly person, but even if you are it's great to see more!

This program is also good to be more involved in excercise. You have to feed and water the animals two are three times a day. Also, stalls have to be cleaned. When you spend so much time with the animals it sort of creates a bond between the two of you. However it just wasn't work and work, sometimes you have to take a break. Whenever the animals were unloaded we got to do fun activities like baseball, volleyball, fierce table-tennis tournaments, you get the idea. So that's how to get an easy workout!

This program makes you realize how much we take for granted. People are constantly starving or dehydrated, whenever we think that food and liquid is something easy to come by. Also countries are suffering under constant warfare and are very vurnerable. This program allows you to understand what it's actually like to really suffer.

These are the reasons that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. It really opens you up, by helping people all over the world. This is why I believe more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
