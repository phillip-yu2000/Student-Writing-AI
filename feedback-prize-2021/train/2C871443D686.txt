Dear Principal,

Students should perform community service as for it goes a long way. Helping YOUR COMMUNITY makes a humongous difference in so many cases. many people have done community service and they still didn't miss their favorite television show, concert, or a party. Those things will come and go most definitely but what good you do in your life now can take you a long way. I have done community service a couple of times and it was great. I went around and threw away litter trash in near by neighborhoods and mine. Off course it was time consuming but it help me realize to take pride in where I live and make it look better. Not many people do that now a days. This possibly get you into a career by help others and go far enough to a point where you could invent a car that doesn't run of anything but your own thoughts. A lot of college graduates have given time to help communities not even their own! Athletes have their own organizations from the NFL to the Barclay Premier League. You may not know it but you may go to a pro organization and have something like the NFL's Play 60 program. I really hope you consider taking community service a least for four hours. Don't worry youi can take breaks (Depending on the weather: Hot or Cold) lay back for thirty minutes an get back on the job again. Its never late to give back to your community
