Driverless are something you think about in the futrue but no driverless cars are coming. Google's cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a future wth driverless public transportation. The driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis use. They would have more flexibility then a bus. Sergey Brin believes driverless cars would change the world.

Google has been working on these kinds of cars since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Google cars arent not driverless ; the car alerts the driver when dealling with complicated traffic. Different companies are making computer driven cars. In 1950s , General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable to a receiver on the car. The problem with smart-roads is that it would be to expensive to upgrade the roads. The problem with driverless car is that if the car got into an accedent who is at fault the operater of the car or the manufacture.

Driverless cars are soon to be part of our world. The cars would be extremely use full in big communitys and replace taxis. The problem is the cars are not 100% driverless and if the car get in to trouble and the driver is not paying attention there will be an accident.
