Advice is needed a lot in life, and when it is needed seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful. Seeking multiple people for advice is very helpful for making a better choice because it gives more overall information and more points of view. when you ask only one person you only receive one point of view and much less information overall, which in the end may be faster but it is less helpful when you need advice.

When you get advice from multiple people it gives you multiple points of views. This is very helpful because it gives different ways to think, and it can also change your mind about what advice you are looking for. When you speak to multiple people it puts you in other peoples shoes and hearing advice from multiple people can make you feel different about the advice your looking for. you could be researching and be stuck to one point of view, but after hearing multiple people, your opinion could completely change.

Another reason to ask more people when looking for advice is there will be more overall information gathered. When you talk with multiple people it helps you understand what you are looking for because you hear more information which helps greatly when you need advice. Looking to multiple people for advice is also helpful just because it will let you know more about what you are looking for, or it will just let you understand what your looking to find better.

talking to multiple people is very helpful when you are looking for advice, because you get more points of view and you get more overall information for advice. There is very little reason to only look to one person for advice when you can look to a few, because with one person you get less information and only one point of view, but with multiple you learn what multiple people believe and you get much more information which will help you much more in the long term. advice is something needed lots in life, but this is why you should ask multiple people when looking for advice.
