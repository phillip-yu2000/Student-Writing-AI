Could you ever imagine being in class and actually being genuinely interested or entertained? I know I couldn't. However, it might just be possible for the teacher to read you emotions and adjust the lesson for you. I am going to give you two reasons why I believe that using technology to read emotional expression of students in a classroom is highly valuable.

One reason this is valuable is so students do not get bored. One of the things that makes school not so fun for kinds is how uniteresting the lesson is. In paragraph 6 of an article tited "Making Mona Lisa Smile," Dr, Huangs says " A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor." With this technology you would never have to worry about another super boring lesson.

Another reason why this is valueable technology for classroom use is because teachers can see how the student is feeling about the lesson. In paragraph 6, it also states " Imagine a computer knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different." This could also be applied to a teacher. If the teacher sees that the lesson is making the students happy they can go on teaching the way they are teaching.

Now, I have given you two reasons why using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This technology will definetly bring up the grades of students if they are throuroughly intertained, interested, and happy with what they are learning.
