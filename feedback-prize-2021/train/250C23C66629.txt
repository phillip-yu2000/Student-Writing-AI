In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author explains both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The author talks about from what the driverless cars have in store from the areas the driverless cars need help on. In the end, I am more than sure I am against driverless cars.

One reason why I am against the making of these cars are that the word "driverless" in the word driverless car, isn't true. The car is not one hundred percent driverless. The car will alert the driver when needed assistance. Such as heavy traffic, construction zones, and accident scenes. The narrator states, "In fact, none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless." As you can see, the car doesn't live up to it's name.

Another reason why I wouldn't approve driverless cars are that they aren't as safe to a human being in control of wheel. Technolgy is not that advanced to where it doesn't have glitches and issues. It still do. Not saying us humans don't, but wouldn't you rather be in control insteading of trusting a certain thing that is not one hundred percent accurate? Even traffic laws stated that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not what the claim to be. Their not guarnteed driverless and they aren't safe. From not even being real to their name to having issues. I hope I won't see a driverless car on the road anytime to see.
