The "Face" on mars(the red planet) been there since 1976 which is when it was discovered and was not fully formated yet and still is not formed. So,it shows that it was not created millions of year's ago by some extra-terrestrial bieng(s).Also,when the Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) took the photo in 1976 it looked as if it was just a common landform created by some-type of desert storm,and now that other photos have came in from May 24,2001 from Viking 2 we are shown that it is not a face but a few mesa's(mesa-landforms common around the American west) with shadows on it showing features of a human bieng but are really just hills of sand with weirdly shaped landforms and shadows. Also,on many planets we have seen craters,mountain,and canyons that look like something they're not,and when the shadows are not there you can tell that they are just naturally formed sand hills. Finally,In 1998 the Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) took 10 photos much sharper photos(5 times sharper)than the original Viking 1 did in 1976 and the photos on the (MOC) showed and revealed to be that there was no alien monument or alien worshipping monument just natural landforms.
