The Face is actually a natural landform. It's a huge rock formation which is also common in the American West. It's proven by Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbit Camera because it's ten time sharper than the orginal. All this mostly proves that it's not an alien monument.

When NASA reveal the image for everyone to see, the authors thought it's a good way to engage attention on Mars. According to the text, it stated, " huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadoes giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This caption have brought attraction on Mars and books, magazines, radio talk shows, and Hollywood film has starred.

Most of the people thought of an alien comparacy but when Malin and his MOC team snapped a better view of it, it proves it wasn't an alien monument. According to the text, it stated, " And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a oicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

If it's not an alien monument, what is it? Garvin said it was a landform which reminds him of mostly Middle Butte. According to the text it stated," What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."

The picture is a landform after all. Most might be disappointed that it's not an alien monument. It's also been proven by the pictures over the year they had taken of which mostly is not an alien monument. Again, it's a picture of a butte or mesa, which are common around the American West.
