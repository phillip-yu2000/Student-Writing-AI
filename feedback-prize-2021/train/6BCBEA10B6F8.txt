The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program. It pervides once in a life time chances and you get to help others as they are struggling. The Seagoing Cowboys takes about 335 horses plus enough hay hay and oats to feed them, so you will need some experience with large cattle.

While our main goal is to help others in need we also have fun while doing it. We have some time for sight seeing, and on the way back to the United States when the cattles is gone, we like to play games like basball and volleyball in the empty holds. We also like playing games like table tennis, fencing, and boxing.

I for one am very grateful that I got the opportunity, it made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs, and that awareness has stayed with me all my life. It is an excellent experience. But its not for everyone like i said earlier you should have some experience with cattle, and there is a lot of hard work involved.( Especially when your the night watchman.)

Over all its a thrilling and exiting eperience that really gets you to realize others needs. So if your a Cowboy that love adventures, and doesnt mind getting dirty and working hard, the Seagoing Cowboys program is definently for you. Come on what are you waiting for sign up today.
