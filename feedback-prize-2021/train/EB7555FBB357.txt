Driverless cars both have good and bad aspects. I have reasons on why we should not have driverless cars. With driverless cars it makes people more lazy, accidents are more likely to happen, and a lot of people are not going to know the rules of the road as they should with driverless cars.

It is lazy to have driverless cars because people would feel since they don't have to drive they don't have to pay attention to the road. Also, most people will just sit there on their phones and chat and think that it's okay. No one will actually pay attention because of the fact that it is a driverless car, but they do still need to be driven by a human when it comes to specific complications. Such as, when there is traffic or certain road conditions. If people are not paying attention then how exactly will they know.

Accidents are more likely to happen with driverless cars. All drivers should be aware of the rules of the road. If the driver is not paying attention and the car is in need for a human to drive it is likely that the car will lose control and an accident can happen. That would make the roads more dangerous than they already are. That's why if there were driverless cars the driver still needs to have all eyes on the road.

For new drivers with driverless cars they will not know the rules of the road like they should. If they are driving a driverless car they most likely are not paying attention to the road and knowing exactly when to go, when to stop, and what the signs on the road mean. Without knowing the rules of the road it is hazardous for you and other people driving. If driverless cars are to happen everyone should still practice they rules, especially if the car is in need for a human to drive. That will make the roads safer.

In conclusion, driverless cars shouldn't be taken into consideration. It is hazardous and more likely to cause accidents. People should be very careful and know exactly what they are doing if there will be driverless cars.
