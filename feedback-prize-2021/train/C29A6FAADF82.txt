I disagree but at the same time i agree with it, because that i feel like the students should get to choose if they want to participate in an activity involving school, its not really the principle job to make the students participate in an school activity. The principle shouldn't have that rule because he don't know whats going on at home, students might have a funeral to go to, they might have to visit a relative and that is some of the reasons why he shouldnt have the rule.

another reason he shouldn't have the rule is because some people might have to go to work, kids might have to go to work is to help pay the bills around the house and some people with a single parent often tend to getting a job so they won't get evicted from there house, and people try to keep the bills payed so they can have warm water and cool air in the house so they can survive and if the school try to make the rule official it will cut off time for work and the bills won't get paid in time.

a second reason he shouldn't have the rule is family plans, sometimes family plan things to get to gather in there free time like a family cook out, going to a restaurant,and just going out and having fun with relatives, since the rule is you have to join a school program it will give you less time to spend time with your family especially if you choose sports because sports are after school.

but i agree with it because the principle just want students to get involved with school and after school programs so everyone has something fun to do in there free time and help the kids stay out of trouble and do something productive with thereselfs and get to meet new people and make friends around the school and thats how i aggre withe the rule.
