Dear state senator,

The way that we vote our next president has to change. Election by popular vote is more reasonable and smarter than using the Electoral College. As stated in The Indefensible Electoral College it is stated that "The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor." The Electoral College  is not a smart way to vote the president because voters are not voting for him, they are voting for the electors of his or her state who could turn around and elect the opposite candinate than what the voter wanted.

Although I think that the Electoral College is useless others think it is. One of these people is Richard A. Posner who states in his article that it is entirely possible that the  winner of the national popular vote will not win the election but this happens rarely. He also states that "The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president,not the people." This is proof that even thouh people defend the Electoral College, the popular vote system is the more democratic and right way to elect the president.

Electing the president by popular vote is the best way to solve the problems in the presidential voting process. With this the people who are the voters will be the ones who elect the president. Unlike the Electoral College there will be no slate of electors who choose the president based off of the people's vote. Popular vote makes every voters choice matter with the elction of the president.
