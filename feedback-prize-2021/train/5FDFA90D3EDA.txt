would prefer having more people because you would get more point of views. You Also don't know the things a person as been through, like for instant. Say a person went through a bad time in life and you wanna learn how to get through it. You wouldn't talk to someone who's trying to tell you how hard jobs are, you would want to talk to someone who's been in your shoes before. It's just better that way, and you will have more then just one person to help you make a good Choice.

whether it's sports, work or school even just life its self. That's my honest opinion. Also To be honest.

what is the worst that couldÂ happen. All you would get is Extra Point of views on how to take on the Situation and extra opinions. You might love or hate thats why you have to ask more then one person. Thats why you need to indulge yourself in more people so they can give you more opportunities.
