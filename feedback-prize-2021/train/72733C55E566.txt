Dear senator

I would change to election by popular vote because electrol college we can not vote for the presidents  we would have to vote for  how many number a of slate pledge for the person you decided to vote for and the electors can be anybody not holding public office. the person that picks the electors it depends on the state sometimes its state convention,sometimes the party's central committee,sometimes the presidental candidates themselves. the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century in the text it stated "the system allows for much worse consider that states legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thet those electors could always defy the will of the people". but perhaps the most worrying is the prospect od a tie in the electrol vote.

The electrol college isw unfair to voters. during the 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all and the aguments in favor of it most assertions without  much basis. it hard to say this but bob dole was right: Abolish the electral college.
