In "The challenge of Exploring Venus" I say the author makes good points for both sides. I would say he is going with it would not be a very good idea to try an explore Venus.

He says " A thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus". This is one reason it would be very hard to explore Veuns. Also becuase on the surface of Venuse the temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit."the pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet". This is saying that this enviroment would crush a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans on earth. Also venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our sorlar system. With it being that hot it would liquify the metals we have on earth. This is why I think that the mission or challenges needed done to get to Venus are not worth the risks of loseing money or more importantly the lives of good people on this earth.

In conclusion the fight to see whats on Venus is not worth it. They have no way to even set foot on this planet. They would imeditaly be either crushed by the 90 time greater pressure than we exsperince. Or die to the 800 degrees fahrenheit that the planet has to offer.
