Many places around the world are limiting the usage of cars. If more places created regulations like these, it may drastically change the environment, for the better.

Vauban, a suburb in Germany, made conditions in the neighborhood almost impossible to own a car. While it may seem like an annoyance, many of the residents are happier this way. According to Heidrun Walter, a resident of Vauban, "When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way." While many people may see having to give up or not use their can an annoyance, if they get used to it they might find that not using their cars may be a good thing.

Instead of having to hear car engines and honking horns, they can take a relaxing walk or even a bike ride somewhere.

Limiting car usage would also be very helpful in cleaning up the environment. In "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" the author states, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States." Limiting the amount people can drive their cars could reduce a hefty amount of pollution in our air. In France, they limitied the amount of people who were allowed to drive for two days. Paris has more pollution in their air then most European cities, but putting regulations on who could drive significantly reduced the amount of smog in just a few days, according to Robert Duffer.

Putting regulations on car usage can also make the area you live in a much nicer place. In Colombia, a few cities have an annual "Day Without Cars", where citizens are fined for using their cars. As a result, things like restaurants and malls have been being built. They are repairing more sidewalks and building new bicycle paths. Parks are being used more often. The communities would be much nicer places with out the frequent use of cars.

Limiting the use of cars is a very good thing. It helps the environment, and it helps make the world a nicer place.
