Why would people use this type of technology to read students emotions and why is it valuable. I'll tell you why it's valuable. I'll also tell you if it's wrong to do this. I'll tell you if it's right to do this.

I think this type of technology is great to read students facial expressions. Because if a student is feeling sad and the school didn't know the school can help that kid if there is something wrong. They could figure out weather that kid is always bored in a certain class so maybe the teacher can make the class funner. They can use this technology to see if a kid is angry in a certain class and that the school can ask why the student gets so angry in that class like is he getting bullied or he just hates the class. Im all for this technology i think it's really cool.

But there are also the negatives to this technology. Lets say a student dosent want anyone to watch him when he's trying to do work or when he's at home doing stuff. Students don't want their privacy invaded. If students don't want people to know what feelings they are going thorugh then maybe they should'nt do this.

That is my opinion on this new technology. I don't know if it's wrong to do this or if it's the right thing to do. I think they should take a vote if students want this or not.
