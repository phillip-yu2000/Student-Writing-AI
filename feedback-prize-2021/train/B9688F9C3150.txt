Hello, I'm Luke Bomberger and I work for the "Seagoing Cowboys". We are a group of people who bring animals in boats to countries who are in need and have suffered from the war called "World War 2". We work for a group called the U.N.R.R.A. (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). They are a society that gives to those who have suffered from the war.

You should join me and the other Seagoing Cowboys so we can do an even better job of helping people! On return trips, we play games in empty animal holds such as baseball,volleyball,fencing,table tennis, and more! We have so much fun all the way home!

We have gone all over the world, we have gone to Greece, Venice,Europe, China, and other places around the globe! We even see things that countries are known for, such as the Acropolis in Greece, and the Panama Canal in China! Even though we work hard to help people, we get to see the amazings sites that just wow us! We even get to do things in the countries besides our job, like the time we took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy!

We bring the animals to countries all over the world so people can live better and healthier lives. The animals give them food, and a way to get around (on horses). The people can even get money if they sell the animals. The animals help people in need every day! The animals help the countries prosper and regain wealth from the loss of the war! You can help people around the world if you become a Seagoing Cowboy!
