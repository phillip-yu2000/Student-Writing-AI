If you had an opertunity to become a Seagoing Cowboy take it.

You should take it for two reasons, first it could be fun, second you could learn about the places you travel to. You could be one of the few who can say that the have fun for a living. Imagin this your at a famaly reunion and evey one there had no enteresting storys to tell you can tell them about your travels.

It would be fun to go to japan maby go shoping or go to a salon. You could go to disney world and met your favorit disney prinsess. Your frinds could even come along and have fun with you. Also get paid to have fun that is even better. So that is one reason why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

You could get a better education. You could learn facts about japan it's history and it's traditions. You can learn about different wars or different animals. You can spread your knoglage to the world. That is just some of the purkes of being smart.

There are lots of reasons to be a Seagoing Cow boy but I listed just a few. You can be like Luke and have fun and learn. You could also wast a opertunity like that and regret it. If you get that opertunity do with it what you will but you can't have your cake and eat it to.
