Come join the Seagoing Cowboys. This essay will give many reasons as to why you should join, the Seagoing Cowboys.

If you like taking care of livestock then this is a job you will want. While you are on the boat you will have to,clean stalls,feed the livestock,clean livestock,and possiblly do night watch. While you are coming back from the place you dropped off the animals at,you could paticipat in table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games.

If you like traveling then this is the perfect job for you. You are traveling all the time with the Seagoing Cowboys program. Going place to place is something something we Seagoing Cowboys do all the time. Trips as long as a month have happened or some as long as one day. I have taken nine trips now.

Also us Seagoing Cowboys love to see tourist atractions. So far I have seen The Acropolis in Greece, the City of Venice,Italy a city of streets of water, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal my way to China.

The danger and risks you will take are huge! Once I was on night watch and I had to go down and check on the animals every hour. I was coming up a ladder,and slipped. That night I had almost fallen into the Atlantic ocean. I was lucky to escape with my life,but I broke a couple of ribs. That next day I couldn't do my job, so my captin let me take a day off.

I hope you join me and my crew. Become a Seagoing Cowboy. Seagoing Cowboys have to be tough,both pysical and mentally. I took the risks, will you?
