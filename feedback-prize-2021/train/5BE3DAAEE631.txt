Rows, upon rows, upon rows of students glued to a computer screen while a facial recognition technology scrambles to fix the plague of boredom that has overtaken the students. The new facial recognition technology could be valuble, but not nearly as valuble as teachers. Sure, the technology is cool and new but it cannot connect on the personal and emotionel level that a living, human techer can.

Furthuring the development of facial recognition technology for the purpose of education is unnecessary. Teachers are one of the most important jobs there is, we can't just replace a teacher with a computer program. Some of the best and most memorable people is have ever met have been teachers. Humans are complex creatures and in the text the author states that the program can dectect just 6 basic emotion "Eckman has classified six basic emotions", how could it teach us better than a fellow human. Teachers also teach us not just lessons on school subjects but life lessons as well which a computer program cannot do.

Although having a computer program teach might be cheaper in the long run as you don't have to pay them after you buy them, but think of what is really more valuable; education.
