I think that it is not a very good idea because you may be sick one day and miss a test or assignment and it may drop your grade from a B average to a C average which would not be very fair to that person. What would you think if you were already in sports and then the principal changed the policy and you were kicked out of that sport which may be your favorite or and you may have waited all year for that sport.

what would you do if you were kicked out of sports they usually keep you out of trouble and are good influences on your life. They also help you make friends and enhance your concentration. That would be like saying i' m going to take away your coffee because you didn't do your job right. I believe that it would help a little because it would help make your grades better and give you a better understanding of what you have to do but if I could decide to do this or not I probably say no because it would give people excuses to sit at home and do absolutely nothing and play video games all day.

If my principal did this I would ask my parents if I could switch schools though they would probably say no it would kind of prove a point and show them that I don't accept it then maybe they will try to do something.
