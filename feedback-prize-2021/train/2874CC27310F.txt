If you get opinions and are getting advice from multiple people,would it be better or worse. It would be better because you would not only have one persons opinion to go off of but more.

You may not agree with this person that gives you advice. They could give you advice that you may not really like.

That's why you want to go to multiple people to get advice from. When given advice, you want to at least agree with the person that is giving you the advice. If you don't you might not want to follow their advice anymore. If not just go to other people and see if they have any better advice.

One person could give you better advice than someone else. If you only go to one person than you could of missed so much advice that you could of got from someone else. You always have a chance to get better advice. That's why you don't only take advice from one person. Somene can give you good advice but there is always someone with better advice to give you.

Its always good to get different opinions and different advice from multiple people. You may not agree with them or not get the best advice ,when you could have got better. You should not go off of one person's advice. You should go off of a lot of different people's advice. It's better for you in the long run.Â
