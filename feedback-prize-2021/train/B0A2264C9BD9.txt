Cars that can drive themselves,the concept is interesting. i mean no more driving no more stress from that as in roadrage and foot cramps. It will also cut down many, Many accidents on the road no more human error but i dont like this smartercars. For one i dont have my licsence yet but i think im going to love driving. I really dont see anything wrong with it i think im going to love evereything about the experience. Like it says in the prompt movies and tv has shown carsoff since forever who doesnt like car movies. Fast and the furious series , disneys cars, almost every action movie and a whole lot more. So whats gonna happen no more of those are we going to see every action movie with a car be like knight rider know. Also cars are just great its big part of the culture.

also what happens to the workers, one of the first waves of drivers to go out is semi truckers. What are they going to do. Its already hard enough to get jobs why give some to a robot or program. Even more jobs will go out taxi drivers. I guess we just wont be pickedup by those either or a bus or a uber. Why take the jobs away, for what. Also where does it stop with so many things doing it themselves no a days where do we draw the line. self driving car from google, robotic vaccum cleaners, and more and more. I get that these things can make the road safer. I get that the toyota pruis uses many new features as the position estimating sensors on the leftrear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof and so on. Also that the lidar uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-d model of the cras surroundings. I get all that but do we really want that is it worth it. i mean we mes up were human thats what happens. Also if we dont go threw with these cars we can save the jobs keepcool movies and let people likeme and generations to come enjoy driving. So can i imagine a world where no one needs cars or buys them... i dont.
