You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. I became one when I was 18, and it can open up many opportunities, and adventures.

There are a lot of benfits that come with it as well.

I was a Seagoing Cowboy for two years, and made 9 different trips.

One of my first trips was to Greece.

We delivered 335 horses and brought along enough hay and oats to feed them.

We also got to go to places like Coastal Europe, China, Italy, and the Panama Canal.

Being a small town boy I didn't get to experience many things.

I worked on a farm most of the time.

Now being a cowboy I get to do the same thing with more opportunity involved.

Getting to help people in so many different places is amazing.

When we aren't doing our job we can go visit the community and experience there cultural antiquities.

We don't always work.

When we're done unloading the cattle we sometimes use the animal holds to play games.

We play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and boared games. We also read, and whittle to help pass time.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was an incredible experience, and I would love to do it again.

I got to meet a lot of amazing people and experience different cultures.

If you wish to do the same you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.
