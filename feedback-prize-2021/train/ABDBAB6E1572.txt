Hello, with this prompt im going to be explaining how and why I agree with my prompt question. Hope you guys take some good advice from this prompt.

The first idea I had in mind with is making new friends. If you agree and you like making new friends, then would be really qualifiedÂ for these kind of activities that your principal has listed.

Now, im going to break it down for you guys. My second idea is when you are bored at home everyday after school, and you go complain to your parents that your bored because you have nothing to do, then sighning up with one of those activities shouldnt be so hard for you. So now you wouldnt have to go home bored everyday.

Also,you start communicating with more people. And once you meet someone nice, you guys might have a few things in common with each other. Thats why it is so important to start trying new things , because you'll never know the good things that'll happen.

Ohh yeah, one more good thing, is you can also create new things or think of somemore cool ideas for your principal to add to that activities list for your school games or something that'll make people smile. People would love to get in the spirit fun games and activities. But I hope when someone reads theis prompt. You guys would wanna go try new and fun activities or some new things. The End.
