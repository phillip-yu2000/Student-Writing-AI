Phones & Driving

Do you use your phone while you're driving? Or do you be in the car with people who use their phone while they're driving? I believe we should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.

Emergencies always happen on the road. It ranges from wrecks to flat tires. People always need road side assistance. Without a phone how would you call 911 if someone have a wreck and need assistance right away? Things always happen when you're on the road, you can only control the way you drive. Not the way others drive.

Most people don't know there way round the whole entire world. It's not fun to be lost. So directions is the key to stay on track. We don't want to stop people on the road to keep asking them questions. You may say "Why not just use a map"? Maps are confusing for some people. Not everyone is like that though some people rather go old fashion. Also some people might not have extra money to buy a car GPS. If you have an app on your phone for free, why pay money out your pocket?

Weather is important while you're driving. Some weather be to savior to drive in. So checking it frequently is important. Weather can cause accidents and everything. How else you're going to check it while traveling? The radio may tell you but what if you miss, what you are going to do then?

Seeing all should of changed your mind. If not changed your mind it made you rethink things. Just remember using phones while driving is okay. We should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.
