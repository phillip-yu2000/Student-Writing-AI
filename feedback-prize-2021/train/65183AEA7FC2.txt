To my principal:

I think that the rule your wanting to do is a great rule!

It shows and tells students that to do a sport you have to keep grades up. And also that grades come before playing a sport, there are actually a lot of students at my school that have a C average and are in sports. I just think in my opinion that it's a great idea!

When the students sign up for the sport or sports I think that at that point they should also think would I be willing to keep my grades up and have late night games with having to still do homework. I play volleyball and when the season comes around to play I stress a lot with homework and late night games but, it's all worth it to me!

We'll I so agree with you about having to have a B average and above to still be able to play.

I also believe that you should start the policy at the beginning of a semester or the beginning of the year, just so if someone is failing and is in a sport you could start it at the beginning of something and not in the middle of something to were they have no time to get the grade up.
