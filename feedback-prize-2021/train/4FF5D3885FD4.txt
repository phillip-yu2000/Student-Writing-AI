When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. They may think that just one opinion isnt enough and want variety rather than one or two opinions for advice. The person may also be open to suggestions if they dont know what to pick and need more options.

As they say, "variety is the spice of life" and that could very well be helpful when making decisions. Having variety in decisions usually helps to narrow down choices. Variety also sometimes is a lifesaver when making a decision. Variety is normally a very common resource that is found quite often.

Multiple viewpoints from other people or their suggestions usually help for when someone wants to know another persons' point of view.

Negative and positive viewpoints also help construct criticism that is usually important for a person when they need feedback on a viewpoint or an idea to help decide something.

Influence from peers or friends almost always influences someone whether it's realized or not. Making decisions is also affected by influence whether good or bad it still helps someone to make a decision. Influence is usually vital to making a decision.
