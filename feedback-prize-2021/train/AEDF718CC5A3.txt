Driverless cars are one of the best ideas there could ever be for our future.

It would be a easier, more safe, and more reasonable for traveling in a car.

It has always been a want in sociaty. In paragraph two, "Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves." People have been imagining this for years and have been pursuring the topic since the year 2009. Driverless cars may be a bit more to make and sell but they would save lots of money on gas, taxis, buses, ect. In paragraph three the passage talks about how people have been trying to do this for years, since the 1950's even!

Not only would it be what people want but it will eventually be what sociaty needs. For safer roads as the article says, we dont need safer drivers or safer cars but safer roads. With this being said, roads with only driverless cars would have very minium problems, accidents and what not.

This wouldn't be a so callled easy or quick prosses with getting these cars out on the road as soon as possile either, minor problems/faults with still occur. Monitoring these vehicles as they drives where ever is a smart thing because they can see how and why these errors happen, to be fixed.

In the article it talks about how people would still be able to drive these cars like normal if it is a desire. Here is where the idea wouldn't turn away people that like driving.

Driverless cars is again, one of the best ideas for our future. It is smart, safe, engery sufficiant, and logical way of transportation in the time ahead of us. Car manufactors have been and are pursuing this as it is, making it safer, smarter and better all around everyday.
