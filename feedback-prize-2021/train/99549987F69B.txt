The prorcees that the president is chosen might be a flawed one, but all systems have flaws. There is no such thing as a flawless system, so if we were to change the way of somthing as important as the way we elect who leads our country, we would have to know it was an amazing system. The process of electing our leader by the electoral collage has it's perks and downfalls, it's supporters and it's opposers, but this has been the way of chosing our leader for many, many years now, and I see no reason of changing it now.

To start off, the electoral collage is a good way of electing a leader because although the popular vote may not win once in a blue moon, the system still is able consistantly be able to chose the rightful winning president the the country has elected. Also in the case of tie, which is possible due to the even number of the electoral votes, the dision is handed to the house of representives, though it has never happened before.

Now, this method works because no one region has enough votes to elect a president. So if a region with ahigh population wants on president, they might get them if it was down to poplar vote, thought with the electoral collage, the chocie has to be a fovorite regionwide. not one region such as the south or the northeast can be an absolute deciding facor, like the popualr vote method. The presidents who know they will will win a state or even a region will not bother campaging in that stae if they alreay know they will win it.

With these reason in play, I belive that the electoral collage should stay before we put an even more flawed system in play to elcet our leader. The way we elect our leader is fine the way it is and you know what they say, if it's not broken then don't fix it.
