Dear Principal ,

I think that all students should to community service , because it'll help us be more responsible , caring , and it'll make the place we help a better place to be . Some people may think it takes out to much time but really it doesn't , the community service can be during school hours , or on your weekend while doing the things you normally do , lets say your going out with your friends to the park , you can clean up some litter on the floor , maybe help the kids around you , take pictures for proof and that's all that needs to be done . Its not something hard to do and in the end it benefits you and the area around you , so technically its a win , win situation . Maybe to get more kids to do it is by for all the community service they do it will give them extra credit in some of there classes and maybe a little prize for them in the end of the year , now i bet all the kids will be willing to do community service . If some of the kids are still a little more stubborn they can still do community service but just not so much time , just a couple hours , hey it better then nothing right ?

Anyways community service can be a fun experience think about it helping out at your old elementry school visiting your old teachers , remebering when you were there just younger , seeing old pictures of you there , making new friends even if they may be younger . I think that it would be a great experience for all the students , so that is my opinion , good luck deciding !
