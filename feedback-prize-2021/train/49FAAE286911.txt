do i think the computers should be able to scan a kids face to tell if he/she is mad? no I dont because that means the cia/fbi know has your face on everyone of there computers and knows where you are and if someone was to hack into that camra they could see everythong they are doing witch is an invation of my and your rights. I think thats why there are so many stakers and weird people cause they know how to hack into peoples computers and they smartphones and track them down or ever spy on them in there owen home with out them knowing. So there for I dont think a computer should be able to scan a teacher, or a students face If it was me i would covor the camra up and not let anyone see it or if they did hack it they wold see a peace of paper shaded in with a black tint from a marker. do i think they should stop trying to make stuff that scans your face yes i dont think they should be aloud to do that because its my right rathor i want some computer to scan my face. If it could scan my thumb or finger or ever my hand i would be ok with that but it dont it scans your face and in that case i say no that that.
