Dear Principal,

Please do not enforce the policy to not allow students to participate in extracurricular activities without a grade B average. Students should be allowed to participate with at least a passing grade. Also, not all students that like to play sports and participate in other activities are able to keep a B average. It would be unfair to not allow them to play because they don't have a B average.

Students should be allowed to participate with at least a passing grade. Some students that enjoy participating are not capable of maintaining a B average. Students want to go and have fun without having to worry about keeping a high grade. They might not be able to keep that high of a grade, but still have the skills, and behavior to participate.

Not all students will be able to maintain a grade B average. Even if they have a B, some students can not maintain it. Maybe they don't fully understand a subject, or miss a few days and there grade drops because of it. Are you just going to say they cant participate?

It would be unfair to not allow them to participate. Grades are one thing, but if they have the skills and behavior to do what they want to, grades shouldn't keep them from doing that. They should have passing grade, but not be required to have a grade B average.

Students should be allowed to play sports and participate in other extracurricular activities with a passing grade alone.
