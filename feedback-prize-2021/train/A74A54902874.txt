Dear Principal,

I think that if the policy change would be okay, Because it would be like a good idea.

Some students in sport or activities with a below a 50 or something shouldn't be participating in sports or activities.

So they can get a chance to finish or make the grade higher then the bad one so they can play or participate in any sports or events. When they get a higher grade they can play or participate in the events that the team is having. So students can make higher grades in class and be a smart kid. So they can have good collages and a good futures waiting for them.

But they can at least make a B on there test or semester or whatever. So they can play or be able to participate in any school events. They can make there life's a little bit happier. If they grow up they can get a lot of money and they will probably become famous because of this.

But it would be a good idea to this possible policy to change. and the students that have sports or that kind of nature in that particular are will probably hate that idea. As much as the other student body. Well as you can know thanks for reading my letter, and you can make a difference out of this. I hope you do what I said.

Thanks,

Student
