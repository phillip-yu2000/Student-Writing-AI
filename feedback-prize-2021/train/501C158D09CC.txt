Yes, I belive that we should use technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It seems like a good result to add to schools. Even more other than just schools people jobs and different areas.

My reason for saying why we should use technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because in the text it says in pragher 6 '' A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored,''.'' Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. By saying in other worlds when u get confused or bored the computer can try different things like make the lesson a little better and fun and slow it down for you and try different ways to keep u on track and in gagens.

Other reason why we should have technology to read the emoitional expressions of students in a classroom is because it even helps when students come to school upset and in a bad mood it qoutes in the texts about that saying ''By weightiong the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions(as in da Vinci's masterpiece).'' also it says in the text ''Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).'' Saying it can help you in all type of different ways far as when u are in your moods.

To finsh it up about why we should use this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is because it wont to keep people up and understand whats going on and not confused or bored. Trying to keep people montived and trying to teach different ways of teaching when en the lesson get hard or not fun and the teacher do not know everything so this technology can even help the teacher out with the students.
