i dont relly see a use for that i mean what whoul you use it for if kids are mad its not thats hard to see if there mad or not why would we need an computer to do it for us when we can do it ourselfs and i dont know how much money it would cost but i imagan it would be a lot and for what telling us if a kid is mad i understand for reserch pouposis but not for really anything diffrent. now that i read the passage even further now i see some more use of the computer for kids that do not want to ask for help and they just sit there all confused and dont do anything about it the teacher can go up to them and ask if they need help maby in like a big collage becuse i dont think school computors could handle it like they say in the passage our computors at home could not handle the complex agrithomes and i dont think a lot of schools have the money to do that
