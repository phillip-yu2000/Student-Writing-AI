I am against driverless cars. Driverless cars do not seem very safe for a couple reasons. For years, we have been driving cars all on our own, and we have been just fine.

Driverless cars may seem new and exciting and it is, but they can also cause us harm. The driverless cars have tons of technology to it. It can help us break, notify us, drive us ,and it can take over the car. Which seems great but the quote, "If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?", is a huge issue. If the technology fails and we are injured, it can be our fault or the cars. No one will really know, and that can cause an issue. The person who is injured could sue the manufacturer, but it could not be done because no one really knows who's fault it was. It will be two times more likely to be in an accident if we had driverless cars, because we could cause our injury and a technology misfunction could cause it too. The technology would take over so much that we would just sit there. Some states even make computer driven cars illegal, and many states limit the use of semi-autonomous cars. They will need every state to make driverless cars legal and limitless in order to have driverless cars. Also, the driverless cars would cost too much money for everyone to have either.

It will be much safer to stick with us driving the cars, and not the driverless cars. Driverless cars can injure us and many others, and we have been doing just fine driving on our own. The driverless cars would cost way too much too. Also, every state will need to make driverless cars legal and limitless, if we developed driverless cars. This is why I disagree on having driverless cars.
