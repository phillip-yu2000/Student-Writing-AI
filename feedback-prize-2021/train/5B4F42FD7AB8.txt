Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think the idea of students performing community service is a grate idea. In fact I'd love to help with that and take time out of my life to help with this. It may seem silly, but to me the environment is really important to me. It's where i can have my fun and skate and hang out with friends. If nobody did such a task, the world would look like one huge trash can, garbage can, dump, Etc.

To help with this important matter when we're done with our trash, we should put it in the right despoils can so that it is actually thrown away properly.

But this all should be an option. Nobody should have to do this if they want. Let them go play have fun while other kids work their butts off to make our planet a better place. When they see how their world is being treated, they'll do anything to help 'cause I know for a fact they won't want there "playground" to be all dirty.

Let's just say you required community service. Do you actually know how many people would do that like for real? Maybe about 9% of the school. Some kids are always complain about everything. Hey, I'm one of those kids too. But there's always times when I know I HAVE to be serious. And when it's something like this, I'm totally serious.

To me I would back up you [TEACHER_NAME] for community service. I want to see who actually cares about our planet.

Thank you for your time.

Yours truly,

STUDENT_NAME
