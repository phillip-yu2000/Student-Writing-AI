Dear Principal

I don't agree with the police that u have to have a B average to play a sport. Many people have a C average. If you change the policy to you have to have a B average to play a sport you will have very little people playing sports. There will not be enuff people to play sport. It needs to stay you have to have a C average to play a sport. If u wont to change the policy then u need to change it to u have to have a high C average to play a sport.

The policy is not a good policy to have. I doesn't need to be such a challenge to play a sport you just need a little challenge to keep your grades up.

Students a motivated when they play sports. Students need to be stay active. Students will not be happy if you change the policy. If they don't play sport there will start doing less work and skipping school. Sport always need to be a kids life so please do not change the policy every one here will bee happy. Students will be healthy and stay alert when your have sport and activity's.

The police doesn't need to be changed it is good the way it is. Students will be happy and teachers will be happy if u leave it the way it is. There will always be school pride in the school if you don't change the police. I hope you under stand my thinking off the new police.
