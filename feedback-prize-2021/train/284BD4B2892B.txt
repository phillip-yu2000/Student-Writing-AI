Dear

State Senator

,

I think the Electoral College would make voting harder. The Electoral College is unfair and votes on its own favor rather than what the people of America think. The reason is because Americans (

voters

) are not voting for their president, but for a slate of electors, who then turn and elect their president. Its a bit overruled that by declaring candidate with most popluar votes winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in the modern sense...it is electors who elect the president,not the people. The Electoral College does not let the majority of candidates votes cast making a difference in voting. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the prsident turned off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The Electoral College Method is from the past its not made for the modern day voting system, it makes voters not want to vote for there freedom or president its not made for present day voting
