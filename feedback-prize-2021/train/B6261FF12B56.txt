By reading this article I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a great way to choose our next president or Vice president. The way the process works is by how many people have voted for that on person. Each canidate has to travel to each and every state and talk about  why you the people should vote for him/her. Now some citizens think that there should not be a Electoral College because they think that they are not being accounted for but when really they are. As you can see Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of Electors,who is in turn elect the president. The five main reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. These are the reason why i think that we should keep the Electoral college its a great system and its been in the United Staes for a ery long time.
