Driverless cars are coming. Now imagine a future where everyone has a driverless car. In some movies driverless cars are shown. In 2009, Google created a car that drove more than half a million miles without a crash. However, Google, BMW, and GM cars aren't truly driverless. The cars still need a human controling them. Their cars need features like a vibrating seat, flashing lights, or a camera that alerts the drivers when to take control of the vehicle.

One of the features that some driverless cars have is a vibrating seat. GM developed a seat that vibrates when the hevicle is in danger and it needs a human to take control of it. For example, When the car is backing into an object the drivers seat vibrates and a human has take control of it to prevent a crash.

Another feature that driverless cars have is flashing lights. Some cars have this feature. The lights start flashing when the car needs someone to take control of it. For example, In a workzone the car can't pass, so it needs someone to control it. The lights start flashing to alert the driver that it needs to control it in oder to pass.

The third feature that driverless cars will have is a camera. Manufactures are considering using cameras. Manufatures wants to use cameras to see if drivers are focused on the road. For example, While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.

I acknowledge that some people don't want driverless cars. However, those who don't like the idea should stay away from driverl. ess cars and leave the concept to people that want it. Driverless cars are not for everyone. Driver less cars are for people that can aford it.

In the future manufacturers will create a car that will be fully driverless. Like Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to release driverless cars by 2020 Researches will go on and new techologies will be created in the future.
