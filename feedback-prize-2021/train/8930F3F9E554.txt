policy 1:

I actually like policy one because we should at these be aloud to use them sometime a day instead of being bored the whole day. and I think it is fair as long as we have them off when its not free time or lunch or during class time i think it is a fair decision i also think every school do that so they would have more money and business by the more students wanting to come to the school. and because they will have something to look forward to when getting ready in the morning. and they would want to be prepared by keeping there cell phones off will doing other things.

they would think there school is the funniest school in the district . and there school will get voted top school. student would not have to take advantage of it because they would be aloud to use there cell phones during the day . they would be more active and involved in school because it wouldn't be boring like all they other school .
