Principal,

I would choose policy 1. Because if students weren't allowed to have phones at school it could also cause possible problems. If their parent was trying to get a hold of them before school was out to ask them to pick up their younger sibling or tell them where they were going and where the spare house key would be. They could call the school, but the phone could be busy. Or the office could forget to tell them. The student could also find out that they had a meeting after school that they would have to attend. If they were in sports they could have switched a home game to an away game, that their parents had planned going to and watching.

Policy 2, would help with students texting in class. It could also help with students texting during a test and telling each other answers. But the teacher could have a basket for test days that the student would have to put their cell phones in. After they have completed the test and turned it in the could have their phone back. If the student didn't want to follow the rules and turn their phone in then maybe, they could take the test in a room where a teacher, or staff were to watch and make sure they wouldn't text and cheat on the test.

For Policy 1, during lunch or free times if the student is using the phone to where it is bothering other students, or teachers then the cell phone should be taken away. After the school day is over they may be able to have it back, but the school would have to inform the student` s parents first. That is why I would choose Policy 1.
