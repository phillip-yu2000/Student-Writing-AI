Everytime you take a look at your phone you are putting not only your life but everybody in the car with you in danger. If it is an emergency i feel as if you need to pull over to the side of the road and text or call who ever it is back. Even if the device is hands free it is still dangerous cause you wont be focused on the road you will be focused on if the device is working or not.
