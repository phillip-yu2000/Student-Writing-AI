Dear Principal

I am writing to you about the policy you are planning to change. My concern is the grades that you require is a little to high for sports. The reason why it would be difficult for students to put all the hard work in themselves to improve there skills what sport they choose to do and then go to school and study and be fully awake during school. Its hard work to that but, there are those who can both work hard attend to practice be great athletes and study really late at night go to school get good grades. Some students may be able to do it average a B but most students I

don't think wouldn't be able to handle the work. In my case I would prefer to average a C+ that's a lot of work me to average I work out three times a week, I have practice 2 times a week and the other days I go to the community recreational center to practice on my basket skills. The reason why i do all this work is because i have the desire! I want to be a winner and I half to put in the work to become a winner. That's one of the things my grandfather taught me no one just hands you trophies, gold medals, captain on the basketball team most valuable player you earn it! That's why I'm going to succeed and be a winner.
