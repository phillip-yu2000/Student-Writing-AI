BENEFITS OF SEEKING MULTIPLE OPINIONS

It is shown in recent studies that not seeking multiple opinions can lead to stress, depression, and most times suicide, which occurs mostly in teenagers, but seekingÂ multiple opinions is more beneficial because it gives us more options to choose from, shows us others point of view to the problem at hand, and it makes us feel better about ourselves.

Seeking others point of view could be overwhelming, but beneficial because listening to what others have to say about the problem could open your eyes and mind to the answer you were looking for, therefore leading you to making a wiser and better decision, overcoming the obstacle that was placed in your way.

Having only one answer could be difficult in solving a problem because the answer you have could be wrong and might not be the answer you were looking for, but having multiple answers would be more beneficial because you could cross out the answers you think are wrong and will still have more answers to choose from. You do not have to do it all by yourself because you have people around you who would give you good advises and help you find the solution to the problem you are facing.

The opinions given to you by others might help solve your problem and might not, but it makes you feel better knowing that you have talked to someone about that problem, which would have released the stress and burden you carry and would bring comfort to yourself and bring peace to your mind and heart, which causes you to have a better mindset and make a better decision.
