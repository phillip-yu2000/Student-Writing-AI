You may think that the Face was created by little green men who fly around in space ships, but all that is just conspiricy. As science tells us, and from what professional scientist have researched and studied at NASA, there is no life on Mars. Whether that life form be intellegent and macroscopic (visible to the naked eye) or bactireal and microscopic (only seen with a microscope). It is obvious to tell that the Face is merely an act of nature. For example, God's Thumb, a rock formation in the desert of New Mexico. The rock formation looks the way it does from centuries of erosion from wind, water, and sand. It is likely the Face has expirienced the a congruent form of events. It is also likely that the Face is a work of volcanic activity. Mars has a rich history of volcanic activiy. Mars just happens to be the home of the largest volcano in the entire solar system. From that information, it would be of no surprise to find the Face to explode in a giant fury of smoke, ash, and lava. Although, it would be an extraordinary happening to see. Going back to the previous point made erosion, apon closer inspection, you can clearly see trenches across the Face. These may very well be from liquid water flowing on the surface, wcich recent discoveries confirms. Also, around the foot of the Face, is a large gathering of rock, dust, and other debris from probabal erosion, evidence for such thing can most likely be found right in your own back yard. Say there is a small pile of dirt or a sand box your children plays in and builds a "mountain" as they would call it. Then after your children come inside, it rains. when the rain stops, you go out and check to see if the area is safe to play in for your children. As you inspect the area of play, you notice small trenches and wash-out around the base of the pile of sand. With all things considered, this scientific reasoning should sway your thoughts of little green men with space ships and laser blasters.
