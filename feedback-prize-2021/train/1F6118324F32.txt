The Seagoing Cowboys is mostly about helping other countries. We help them take care of the horses. They give us hay, and seeds to feed the horses.

We had to feed the horses, and cleaned there stables. If you like helping people, and animals than join. You have night watches each night, and you get to check on the horse each hour. We helped other countries such as China, Greece, Crete, and Europe. You also get to ride a boat called the SS Charles W.

You would get some spare time to go sightseeing. You would get to cross the Atlantic Ocean. On the return trips you get to play games. The games are baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. You get to meet new people. You could make some friends from different countries.

You still have to be careful on the boat. Makes sure you don't slip. If you want to go over seas to help other countries this is the thing to do.
