I think that a Facial Action Coding System would be helpful in a classroom setting. I think this because it could show the teacher what students needed help by the ones looking confused or frusturated. This definitly could be a helpful tool when it is more available.

To go more in depth of how this could be beneficial to a classroom would be it helping confused students who are maybe more shy than others and dont ask the teacher for help when they need it. This program could be in their computer and then it could tell the teacher who looked confused about the work and they could go over and help them easier. Also like it says in the article "Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor." Which is another great idea!

This may not even just help the students, but it could help the teachers become better teachers. This could be done because lets say the students go home and 90% of them look confused or frusturated well the teacher could see that and could either explain it again the next day or make the assignment easier to do. Which from my experience of being a student that would be super nice to have.

Finally if the teacher was really dedicated to their job they could see if students were bored in their class, if so they could try to make it more fun. This could make students pay more attention in class and could increase the graduation rate and even the grade point average of students since they will be having more fun in class and would be more likley to participate.

In conclusion yes I do think we should get this when it becomes more available to public. I think that there is just so many more positives to having these Facial Action Coding Systems than negatives. It could really be a beneficial thing for schools to have in the classroom.
