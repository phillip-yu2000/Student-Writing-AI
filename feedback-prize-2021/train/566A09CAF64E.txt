You will like to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you will take care of the animals that are on the boat. You will get to sightsee and go to different countries that you have never been before. After the animals leave the boat you get to do things on the boat like reading, Table-tennis tournaments, boxing, and more fun activites. Everyday you maybe need to go to deliver the animals to a new country and you will get to feed them and take care of them. This boy named Luke graduatied and his life changed after he said yes to go on a cattle boat.

First, Luke graduated high school and he had two part-time jobs one at the grocery store and one at the bank his friend Don invited him on a cattle boat to go to Europe he said yes and he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. When it was nineteen fourty-five World War two was over in Europe and the UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the animals that were shipped over sea. Luke and Don singed up to be Seagoing Cowboys and in August nineteen fourty-five they received their orders to report to New Orleans and Luke says, "We arrived August fourteen the day the pacific war ended." so they both got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, that was headed for Greece. Luke turned eightteen which meant he could be drafted for the military service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke made nine trips which was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion Luke was a good Seagoing Cowboy but, he was not working for a couple of days because he cracked his ribs on a rainy night. Luke was knowed for making the most trips that a Seagoing Cowboy has ever made. Luke had a total of sixteen times that he croosed the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War two. Luke was a nice caring man who help on the ship and the people. Luke opened up the world to him and had a grateful opportunity that made him more awareof the people of the other countries and their needs.
