Dear Principal,

I think the idea of allowing students to have at least a B average is a good idea because many students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and wont qualify to pass the grade their in.

If we allow students to have a B average, students would focus more on their school work, because they would want to play their sports.

In order for them to play, they would have to focus more, thus giving better grades.

Secondly, students would tend to have bad grades because of sports.

If we set it for a B average, more kids would have to work harder for their grades because they want to play. Therefore students wont have bad grades.

Making it a B average can be an encourager towards students.

Lastly, if students are only making a C average, there's a small chance that the students will pass. If we make it where the grades must be a B average, students will improve their school work, making them have better grades.

Well thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you tend to see why changing the grading average for sports is necessary.

Remember though, students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and wont qualify to pass the grade their in.

Sincerely,
