I think you should allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as they are turned off during class time.

My suggestions are because, students have freedom when they leave their home and sometime parents need to know the condition their child is in especially if their alone after school or before. Phones should also be permitted on school grounds to the due of, when there's an emergency he/she could contact their legal guardian at any free given time they could. For some students after school have activities and need to bring their cell phone to school if their going to nee it in the after noon to call to be picked up, or what ever the situation is.

Cell phones now days, have trackers to keep up with your child if he/she is in some sort of danger if he/she isn't in school. Also some parents even work late or early and sometimes need to let their child know if they'll be home or not, such as my parents do with me. To myself and others in this school we ask very understandably if you could take a second thought on reconsidering the school cell phone policy. I believe policy 1 is better.

Thank you,
