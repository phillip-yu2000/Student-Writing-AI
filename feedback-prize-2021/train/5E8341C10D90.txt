Every day, people make decisions that will affect their life, and they usually consult others before this decision is made. People need more than just one opinion on a topic to provide clarity, and to help them be more mindful about their choice. If most people are telling you to do one thing, they are most likely correct.

So how can getting more than just one opinion provide you with more clarity? Asking people who you trust will have your best interest in mind, and will take that into account when telling you their opinion. They will also have reason(s) as to why they chose what they chose. If you ask several people on their view of the subject, and they all say something completely different as to what you're thinking, and they all agree on one thing, you are most likely incorrect. But, if they all agree with you, you could probably make your choice.

If you are someone who isn't usually very careful when it comes to decision making, asking others will help you. Before you jump into whatever choice you make, ask a friend or someone impartial about the topic. If they don't say what you thought was best, it'll make you stop and think, and maybe even consult others. If your friend or impartial person agrees with you, then you are probably correct. Overall, asking others ensures you won't make your decision too quickly and mess up.

When you get more opinions, it'll slow you down and ensure you'll be more careful. Plus, it'll make the right choice apparent. It is clear you should get multiple opinions to provide you with clarity, and mindfulness.
