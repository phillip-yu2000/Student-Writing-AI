Dear Senator, I am writing to you to speak about the Electoral College versus the popular vote in choosing the president of the united states. I am in favor with the electoral college for many reasons. I am with the electoral college because of certainty of outcome, swing states, and big states.

First, With an electoral college vote there is gonna be arguments but it isn't as likely to happen as the popular votes. Electoral votes exceed popular votes. It is possible to tie because 538 is an even number but it is however very unlikely to happen.

Secondly, Swing states usally vote more cause they pay more attention to the campaign. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters. Swing states like to listen tothe competing candidates. Swing states also known as ''toss-up'' states are problably the most honest but thoughtful voter because of how much attention they give to the campaigns.

Lastly, The electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign then a small state does.

Even though popular voting helps I believe that we should keep the electoral college voting versus popular voting because of these 3 things that i specified above.

Sincerly, PROPER_NAME
