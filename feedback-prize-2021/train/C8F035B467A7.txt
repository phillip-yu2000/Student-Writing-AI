This generation is influenced by technology and they are used to it. They would be more comfortable with it as they are used to it . It's beneficial for students to do distant learning more than to go to school and do it.

Distant learning is already being used through online and video conferencing, This days colleges and universities allows students to choose online courses of their own choices . Students are used to online stuff like, web browsing, gaming, and etc. which gives them an extra advantage already. They would be more successful using online browsing. Video conferencing is another way of distant learning; this would let the teachers talk to students in case they need help. People has been using video conferencing to even take tests at home.

Distant learning would also help them have success in education socially. If students are to stay at home to learn, they would feel more comfortable around somewhere they been for a long time. They could ask people, family members who they are comfortable with, for help if they wanted to. They would be more fit and ready than going to school considering that you have to wake up early in the morning, get ready and walk to school. They wouldn't have to do any of this, and have enough sleep to have a fresh mind to work with.

It is beneficial for students to use distant learning to attend classes such as, video conferencing and online browsing. I personally think that its better for me and lots of other students to use distant learning as it can help in a social and educational way.
