I feel like this would be very useful technology for helping many people in the near future. By having the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) we could tell and understand so much more about the human body that we don't already know about.

The FACS would help us in learning about how exactly how someone is feeling about something or someone. Say, if they could exactly explain how they are feeling we could use the FACS to figure out their emotions. We could also use it in classroom as paragraph 6 says. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." We would finally have the technology to help people who don't understand or are to shy to ask how to do something in the class. The computer would recognize that facial action and go more in depth to help the people who don't understand. Yes, it would make people lose their jobs and bore the other students who already understand the topic but we're still in the beginning faze of the FACS. By using the system we would become way more advanced and learn how to fix these problems. It just takes time to go over and fix. Imagine if we didn't have facial expressions. We wouldn't understand each other and the world would be bland but we do in face have facial expressions and we use them. We've grown adapted to having such a skill but some people don't know how to tell or just can't tell very well. We now put it into technology to help those people and ourselves!

In conclusion, I feel like we would benefit from having and using this technology. As I said above, it would help people understand in schooling, emotions, and in life in general. It would be an even better invention if it became more advanced but we have to use the product for that to happen. I fully support the Facial Action Coding System as it would help us in learning many great things about technology and about ourselves.
