Dear Principal,

I agree with you on the first policy, the student would like to use their phone during lunch, but the student are going to see each other at lunch anyways, and that not going to stop them from having their cell phones on in class. If I were principal I would let the students use their cell phone at the last 5 minutes of class. If they use there phone before the 5 minutes they should be sent to detention. Another think you can do is take all the phone at the beginning of class, then you don't have to worry about anybody having their cell phones, and if they get caught with there cell phones the teacher get to keep it for a month.

Policy one is fair, but the students don't think it's fair. When my friends tell me the teacher took their phone, I tell them you shouldn't have took it out. It not the teacher fault she had to take the phone, she was just following the rules, it the students fault. If the student don't like the rules, they should do something about it, like a petition. The school enforce the rules so when the student gets a job, they won't get fired for using their phone, or talking when his boss is talking. Student just have to get use to the rule and they will be thankful for rule one day.

In conclusion student should have some time to use their cell, but not when your in class. Maybe when you are done with all your work, or during lunch, but not during class, your wasting your time and the teacher's time.
