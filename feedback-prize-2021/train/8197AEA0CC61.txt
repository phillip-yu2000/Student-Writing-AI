This debate about self-operating cars has been in the new for years now. Google say it that they have made one of the first ones. But as our technology has progressed farther, so has our ideas about things. There are many pros and cons on this situation but here are just a few pros and cons,the car keeps you alert, its can cause accidents and it may cause lots of money.

I will start off with the pro of keeping you on task and alert. This is a major pro in this world. Why do I say that? Well, the car has sensors that make you put your hands on the wheel so it knows you are focused. In other words you will not be able to text and drive at the same time. This is the answer to this tradgedy.

On we go with this debate but now on the cons of a self-operating car. There a just as much cons than there is pros. A major con is the accidents. There hasn't been any accident according to the passage but there will be some in the near future. If this happens, who is the blame going to be put on. On the manufacturer? Or what if the person gets injured? The real quesion that it brings up is,"Who to Balme?"

I shall now talk about another con in this peice of machinary. This self-driving car can be very helpful in many ways but the next problem we face is the money. Money is allways a problem when it comes to technology. This car will have to be covered insensor which allow the car to react but it will be very expensive. It also says in the story that the roads will have to be rebulit because of it.

At the end of the day this self-driving car can be both a good thing and a bad thing. But it can keep your eyes on the road, it can cause accidents and it will cost alot of money.
