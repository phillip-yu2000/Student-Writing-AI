I certinly believe that the "face" was created by natural landform. I believe that because earth was created by natural landforms. There is no way that aliens could of created the face. Besides the point aliens do no excist!

There is proof that it was a landform and not aliens. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform". Landforms can cause, alot of things like, holes, cracks. I know that the landform did in fact, creat the face on the planet mars, no one will tell me diffrent.

They have gathered up information and said "there were no alien monuments after all". If there was aliens on the planet dont you think we would of sean them by now? We have took pictures of that planet 3 diffrent times maybe more, we still have not found proof of life on that planet much more the aliens.

That is why I believe that the landform made the face on mars. The face was indeed not created by aliens.
