Dear Principal,

I believe that you should allow the students to have their cell phones during lunch and any free periods. I agree that the phones should be off during class time because they have had time to use it at lunch and free periods. Although there are some kids that still use their phone during class, most of the time the teachers catch them. Many studenst would accept having their phones off during

I disagree with the second policy because I think it is unfair not use our cell phones at all. Even if we have to turn it into the teacher before every class and get it at the end, I think that is better then not having our phones at all. I think that it is unfair because the students here at SCHOOL_NAME try their best to made the best grades they can and even when they aren't doing that well tutoring is enforced. On that note, I believe that having our phones for less the thirty minutes is our little "getaway." Then we are back to class.

I think that the first policy is better because I don't understand why during lunch and free periods you cannot have your cell phone. They are both pretty much a time to allow is to enjoy ourselves and socialize so having your cell phone is not really affecting any of the classes because they will be off while we are learning.

Having our phones off during class will only help. Even if some students don't understand they will still be thankful when they have to do homework and actually remember the lesson instead of little pieces because they were using their cell phones.

All in all, I just ask you to please consider this letter and understand that i believe that the first policy would be better. I respect your decision otherwise though.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
