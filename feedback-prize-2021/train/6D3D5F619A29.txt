To keep students learning, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. Students are very busy over the summer, so school work is not their first thought. Summer projects should be student-designed so the students can have fun while they're learning and not feel pressured to complete the projects.

When students have fun learning, they are able to learn more. This makes information easier to understand. Comprehension also becomes less difficult. Therefore, if learning is exciting, it won't feel like such a task. Students will be more willing to be educated and learn.

Also, pressuring students to complete projects can cause them to become overwhelmed. If projects are designed by the students, they won't feel forced to complete them. Students are more likely to do the assignment this way. Since students don't feel rushed to complete assignments, it won't feel like homework and students will be more willing to finish.

There's so many ways students can have fun while learning and not feel pressured to complete work, however, making projects student-designed is just one of them. Students are young adults wanting to be educated. Once students are able to fully understand the task at hand, completing it is not a problem. With student-designed projects students are able to grasp the concept like no one else.
