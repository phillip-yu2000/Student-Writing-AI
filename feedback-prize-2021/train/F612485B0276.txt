Way back when the only way you could get around is by walking or riding a horse. They didn't have cars back then, they never even thought about getting around by driving. Back then you didn't have to worry about gas prices or anything like that. In this generation everyone think's the only way they can get where they want to go is by driving a car,when that really isn't the case.

Driving in this generation can be fun, but can also cause a lot of disadvantages. Cars can be very dangerous and cause a lot of damage in this world. Right when you get in your car and start driving around you are poluting the air. There's so pollution in this world and cars are making it worse. The world use to be clean before cars came around cars are taking over people and their lives.

Cars cause a lot of accidents. Every second of everyday there is an accident and people are loosing their lives because of it. People don't take driving seriously at all. If we didn't have cars there would be no accidents happening. No one would be driving under the influnce and having to worry about getting in the car and driving home. If we all walked we would be getting our excercise and not have to worry about loosing a life.

I think we should go a week without driving a car and see how everyone likes it. Yes, the sidewalks will be packed but when you drive you have to deal with traffic. Another thing is that you don't have to worry about wasting your money on gas. I think this world would be a better place with less cars and more walking.
