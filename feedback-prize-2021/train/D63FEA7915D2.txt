Firs of all I'd like to state that there has been no scientific proof of life on Mars yet. Im sure if there was life on Mars NASA would have made a big deal about it already. If you look closely enough at the rock in the picture you'll see that it is just a rock. It could of been a lucky rock formation that looks like a face. Just because it does look like a face doesn't mean it has to be from aliens. We have many cool looking rock formations here on earth. Does that mean their made from aliens too? If this particular rock was created by aliens wouldn't the other close to it be made by them too? However the rocks right next to it are just rocks and nobody makes a big deal about them.

If there is ever life on Mars im sure the public would know by now. We all know once something weird or mythical happens the public is quick to find out. There are about 1 in 1,000,000 chances that this is made by aliens. Were not even sure if aliens are real yet. We dont have any real proof they exist, so why do we quickly think its from them? I think people are just jumping to conclusions here. There is a really good chance that this is just a rock. Trust me though, if it was made by aliens NASA would of freaked out by now. For now lets just say its a really cool looking rock until further notice.
