I think that we should keep the Electoral College, because we have certainty of the outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and we can avoid run-off elections. So i will explain a little bit about each one of them to you.

Certainty of Outcome, winning candidate's share the Electoral College invaribly exceeds of their share on the popular vote. Most states award the electoral votes on a winner-take-all-basis. Its possible to have a tie in the national electoral vote becaus the number of votes is an even number but its a very high chance to be unlikey.

Everyone's president, the electoral college requires a presdential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president already. So for a solid region, has no incentive campaign. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised. (To feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, isn't their presdient).

Swing States, or called the Winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes. Voters that are in the toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign. They listen to the competing candidates. Knownig that they will decide the election. But they are most likely to be most thoughtful voters. Thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the elcetion.

Big states, A larger state gets more of the attention from the presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state would have. The electoral college restores some of the wieght in the political balance that larges states would lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.

Avoid run-off elections, there is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the voters cast. Which greatly complicates the presdients elections process. Yes it can be argued the the electoral college method of selecting the president.

So I argue that we should keep the Electoral College.
