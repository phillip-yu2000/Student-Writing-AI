Dear Principal,

Students should not be required to do community service work. Community service is often referred to as "volunteer work", key word being volunteer, meaning that it is voluntary, and people can choose whether to do so or not. I think that community service should be strongly encouraged, but not required.

Students have quite a lot of work, and are very busy. Not only with school but also that many have after school activities that also take up much time. Some may not have time to do anything else. Community service is very important, but cannot be done if one does not have the time to do it. Students may become overwhelmed with all their activities and not do as well in some areas. You do not want to commit to too many things, more than you handle, because it can negatively affect things such as schoolwork. Students can be very busy, and having one more thing to worry about in their schedule can be overwhelming, which is why although community service should strongly be encouraged, it should not be mandatory.

Although students should not be required to do community service, it should be very strongly encouraged. Most students will likely decide to do community service even if not mandatory, because they would want to give back to the community and help others. So even if community service is not made a requirement, most will likely still do something to give back to their community.

In summary, students should not be required to do community service because of conflicting, and busy schedules. Although it should not be required, community service should strongly be encouraged because it not only helps the community, but can be a very helpful experience in life. Community service is very important, although should not be mandatory.
