Imagine yourself in your room and your mom comes in and says, " Find an activity to do outside." You just moan and roll your eyes. Don't do that. Find a friend that will join you in your journey of an activity and make it fun. You can find so many activities to do. You can do a sport, an outdoor activity, anything.

What you choose can be a helpful thing for your friend. They may enjoy the activity and want to do it more often. Including, getting stronger and faster during it. Also, they may be determined to go outside more often, instead of being stuck inside all day on technology. It can be a great exercise to do, and it may be really fun to do.

Although your parents bug you about it, think about all the things your parents have done for you. They clean the house, do the laundry, and make you meals. So, in appreciation of your parents, go and have fun outside. Now, your parents can read their book they've been waiting to read. They can take more naps so they're not so cranky.

Also, they can have less stress and not yell as much. And also, less messes for them to clean up.

All of this can also be really helpful for you. You may work more harder than you have in the past. You may find more activities that seem fun and try them for yourself. You'll also be outside more and make your parents happy. These activities can help with your exercise. It may even be really fun, that it doesn't even feel like a workout.

In conclusion, doing something your not comfortable doing, can help everyone in some way. You may help a friend get outside more and have a great time. Your parents can have more free time to do what they want to do. Instead of having to pick up after you and your messes.

You can help yourself by being more active in activities and have fun. Lastley, everyone can help someone in any way that may not include an outdoor activity.Â
