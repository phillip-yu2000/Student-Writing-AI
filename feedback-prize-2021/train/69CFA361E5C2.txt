For many years, people have been debating whether or not Mars has life forms living on it. In 1976, NASA came across a strange image. On the side of Mars, there seemed to be a landform that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Many people believed this to be a sign of life on Mars, but it really is not.

If the image from Mars did infact prove that there is life on Mars, NASA would benefit greatly. "Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars---evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." Why would NASA lie about this if telling the truth meant more funding?

NASA has tried over and over again to prove that the Face is just a landform; we just won't listen. "We felt this was important to taxpayers,' explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. 'We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."

The image is showing us that there is a butte on Mars, of which scientists have made many comparisons to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Of course there might be life on Mars, but there's no way to know for sure. Blaming NASA for lying about the discovery of "aliens" is just simply illogical. NASA is an organization that explores space and everything in it, hoping to find something they can share with the world. The Face may be a neat discovery to show your kids one day, but it is definately not a sure sign of life on Mars.

People need to stop thinking that they know more than the professionals. NASA is an organized group of scientists who know more about space and science than the common person. They have classified the Face as nothing more than a butte, and it's time that we except that. In the future alien lifeforms may be discovered on Mars; that day is just not in 1976.
