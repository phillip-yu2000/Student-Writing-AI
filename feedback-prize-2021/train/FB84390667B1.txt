As a NASA scientist, i believe that there is no possible way for aliens to be living on Mars. I do, however believe that the "Face on Mars" is just a natural landform. Earth's landforms are being created each day. If Earth has the ability to create landforms, surely enough Mars can too.

There have been many conspiracies about the Face, some more convincing than others. Some are about alien lifeforms creating the Face and that some are still living on Mars. We have been searching on Mars since 1975 and there is no known proof that there is any type of living civilization on Mars. We have, however came to the conclusion that the Face is just a recently discovered landform that has kept forming over time.

After many years of study, no alien civilizations have been found living in our solar system. Therefore, it is not possible for aliens to have created such a massive landform. The people who have created these conspiracies have not did any studies and certainly did not knowledge themselves enough to create any logical thoughts or opinions to put out into the world
