I think the idea of Driverless cars isn't the best thing. I do not agree with these at all. I feel like there could many things that could go wrong with these. Here are a few that I believe that are the biggest probloms.

It says that the driver may have to start driving if a work area is up ahead. People may take advantages of them and they will be either asleep or they will be busy on their phone. It would be very difficult to pay attention and have to drive some if your sleeping. People are on their phones now when they actually driving. They are going to be on their phones even more and not paying attention.

Another thing that i think of is wrecks. If the cars do wreck how do you know whos fault it is with a car that has no driver. There would be many people that can be blamed for the accident. Like it said in the passage you dont know either to blame the car company or the driver that isnt driving.

It would be extremely difficult to have all these cars on a grid. they would all have to be on a grid so other driverless cars would know when to stop and turn. all of the cars would have to be programed to the same grid. That could be extremly difficult to have all of them in order and no glitches happen.

Then on top of everything the people that cannot afford the car will still have the cars we have today. If there is still cars on the road we have today then they would also have to programed to the grid with the driverless cars. That could be very expensive and not all people have the money to afford this.

This is why i strongly agree that this idea would not be a good idea unless the government hands them out. Which that would cause a whole nother agurment.
