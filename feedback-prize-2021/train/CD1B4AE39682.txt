Dear principal,

If a student wants to play sports he or she needs to work for it. When a student wants to join a team he or she must know that the main reason that they are in school is to learn not play sports so, grades should be a priority. Also I think that it can help the student create a sense of responsibility therefore I think that any student that truly wants to be in a sports team will work for what they want. A grade B average can be scary to some kids, in my opinion I think that you should lower it down to a high Cc with no missing assignments because if you do that high C will eventually become an B or even an A. I also believe that a student that has time to play sports has time to do homework. It will take dedication from the students part but it is all worth it.

As to other school activities I think it depends on the activity, how much of the students time it will take. If this activity could potentially lead to the student flailing any of his or her classes, but if it could also help the student raise his or her learning standards.
