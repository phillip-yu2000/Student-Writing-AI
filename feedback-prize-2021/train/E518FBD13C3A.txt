According to the article the Facial Action Code System i think is valuable to student in classroom's. I am for it because aacording to the text its tells you how great it can predict how your feeling. The article gives us a little information on how accurate it works numbers showing she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry it shows that the Facial Action Code System is an new way to figure out people's emotions. Also it says the Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Also this new software can show a lot about your emotions for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Also i think its a good idea for students in classroom because the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and your teacher could help you or could try to do something more to keep you from getting bored. I think from the articlke this would be a great thing to get and to start using because according to the text its a great tool to use in the future.
