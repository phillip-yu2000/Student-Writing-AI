this new computer system if it does come out for school it might be help for some of the kids. so when they are getting confused about a mth problem then dont have to raise there hand becuase some kids i know dont like to raise there hand when they are confused about the math problem, so if this comes out it will be able to help the student explame or show them differently so they can understand what is going on. this could also work if the students is at home doing homework and need help well it can help maybe showing them how to do it or taking them to a webister or video showing them what id happening because they cant assk the teacher for when they are home unless they email thee teacher which they might not email them right away. so this could be a good thing to try one some school across the country testing out how this works with students and see how the students react to this computers system.
