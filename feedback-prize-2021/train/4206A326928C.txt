I believe that when you participate in one or two extracurricular activities,you should be set for a good college in the near future. Activities such as sports,student counseling ,and working on the year book. any of that can give you a better G.P.A,and will also give you extra things to do right after school.

When colleges see your records from the past years,from middle school,through high school,they want to see one of your biggest achievements,good grades and to see if you have any other hobbies outside of school as a daily routine or to see if you are working really hard as the student.

Colleges love to see a person working hard for something important,like an education. They like to see kids who give off effort for what they are doing,they also see and look into kids that can go pro in any sport in the future and people who are advanced in academics and learning.

Doing other activities can set a healthier mind set,a healthierÂ body,and can help you set personal goals in life that you wish to achieve, along with a good planner you need when going to college. Also by doing all this you can set a good prime example for a younger sibling of yours.

So out of this i'm saying,by doing the extra activities given to you can really help set aside a goal in your life and me reading this i think that the principle should make kids in middle school do extra activities after school to get in the habit of for high school cause its really going to help them with a better future when going for a university.
