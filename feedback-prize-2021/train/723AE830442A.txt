Have you ever thought about joining in a Extracurricular activity. I have thought about joining in an activity, but I can't because i'm in a soccer team. Also, activity can help you a lot of things. It can help with with getting yourself in fit that means like doing exercise, getting to learn new things that you haven't done, and making new friends. I agree that students should join in a extracurricular activity because it will help them succeed in life.

Extracurricular activity can get you in shape by exercising. First, if you want to get in shape got to eat healthy. Then, Find any outside activity that you like to play. last, have fun with your friends and enjoy it.

Extracurricular activity can help you learn so much things. For Ex, if you don't know how to build sum thing then you can ask the teacher and they will help you understand. So understanding things can help you because when you grow older the things you have done in the past won't benefit you only when u grow older so thats why its good to learn in a young age.

Making new friends is good because you won't be shy when they call you to do something. Also, It's good to have friends because if one friend don't want to do sum thing then the other friend will gladly do it with you. Last, you can't do everything by your self that will be hard in life you will need team work, and communication to help you in life.
