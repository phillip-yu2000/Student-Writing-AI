My Position on driveless cars,I am all for it. In my opinion I think driveless cars would be a great idea. Just imagine a world where no one needs to spend there money on cars. Also imagine a world were there would be barley any car crashes,less acciedent deaths,and aslo more relaxation when driving. That sound like a pretty good world to me.

Driveless cars would be a good idea beacuse it will give the future a terrifc public transportataion system. Also the dirveles cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer alot more reliability than a bus. Driveless cars would drop the killing rate in the world. I say that because there are alot of car accidents that happen where some people dont make it. Inside a driveless car there would be special touch sensors to make sure the driver keeps hold of the weel,GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vechicle is an danger to keep the driver alert,aslo the driveless car would announce when the driver should be prepared to take over the wheel.

The driveless car would be a great, and safe improvement to the future. Automakers are still continunig their work to make the driveless cars to reach all limitations for them to be apporved. In my opinion driveless car would be excilent!
