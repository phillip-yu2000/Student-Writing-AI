Dear Principal,

I am a student of your school, and i am against the rules of the grade requirement.

Most of the students in the school have a C grade average, so it takes away from them, and C is passing, so I believe they should be allowed to participate still as long as they have a C average.

Many kids are very good at sports and activities and all of them aren't always smart, and they might not be able to live life out how they could be so successful. School is a big part of life, but it is not always everything, grades should not be centered around sports, I believe. Pro athletes do not have to have a B average, so why would kids have to do school things to be able to do sports?

Some kids with disabilities, they might be really good at sports or other activities after school, and they might not get the B average, are we going say no to people that can really be successful in life at those skills, just because they didn't have the best grades in school? That would be ruining a kid's life, as he grows up, and he could of really been something in those activities, but his grade messed him up, and maybe he really tried his best.

I think we should change the rule, and give people the right to do the activities. Grades are supposed to be up, but not everyone is smart enough, and they try, but maybe they just can't get it. So I believe that the grade requirement should not be that high, or have one at all.

Your student,
