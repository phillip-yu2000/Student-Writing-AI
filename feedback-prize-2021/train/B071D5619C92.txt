Who likes driving? Everyone has once though of cars that drive themselves. Although it sounds good, Im against the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars can be risky, expensive, and its against the law. Its not worth fighting for.

First, driverless cars are too risky. It is dangerous to be in a vehicle that you can't control. If you were to be in a driverless car and something goes wrong do you even know what to do? Its like any other electronic that may need to be charged and things that charge have the possibility of blowing up. It's not like a motorized car with common mistakes it'll be something most mechanics haven't seen before, and would have to refer you to someone else who may be far and expensive.

Second, it would be very expensive. Smart cars are expensive and these are even smarter cars. In the article, it said "Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020." which are expensive branded vehicles and that makes driverless cars cost even more. The newer the more expensive. Also, if your driverless car needs repaired then it will be very expensive because not many mechanics will have the parts and the experience for these cars.

Last, because it's a law. It's a law for a reason and there must have been problems with this before for this law to have been put in place. In the article, it said, " In most states it is illegal to even test drive computer-driven cars" so why would they be safe to put on the road?

Although driverless cars sound fun, it is not worth it. I'm against driverless cars. Driverless cars can be risky, expensive, and they are against the law. These vehicles will cause havoc on the roads. Do not support driverless cars.
