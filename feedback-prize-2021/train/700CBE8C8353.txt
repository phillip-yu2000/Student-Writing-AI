Dear Principle,

The question - Should all students be required to perform community service? - has arisen. Although these acts of service strengthen our community, their demand should be illegitimate. Requesting community service would take needed time for studying away from those who find their courses more challenging, and denounce the notability of these acts.

Because certain students need a considerable amount of time to be devoted to their school work in able to understand the information they are taught, community service should not be required of the students. Imagine yourself in the position of a young student who has little time to spend with their friends or participate in out-of-school activities, because the majority of their time is devoted to schoolwork. In turn, in order to meet the amount of community service due in the allotted time, they are forced to spend less time in other subjects, consequentially lowering their grade in the class. The resulting situation is that the services aimed to better the community have degraded the student's regime.

Requiring students to perform acts of community service would take away the notability of these selfless acts and decrease their meaning. Participating in community service is a charitable act, that is meant to bring happy and fulfilling feelings to its participants. Requiring these acts would require students to do something they should already do from the goodness of their hearts. If they did this just for a letter grade, it would take away the much appreciated meaning.

As you can see, it would be to the benefit of few to request hours of community service from the students at this school. Doing so would decrease their meaning, as well as cause the grades and free time of more needful students to suffer. I hope you will take my words to mind and make the better decision: not requesting community service from my peers and myself, but, rather, encouraging it.

Sincerely,

Student
