"Hey, do you want to take cattle to Europe with me?" Don Reist asked Luke. Luke went with Don and loved it. Luke decided to make this his living so after WWII Luke traveled the seas as a Seagoing Cowboy. Would you like to do the same?

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy! There is so much to do. For instance for all those people that enjoy sightseeing will like this job. One reason is because in my time being a Seagoing Cowboy I have already seen Venice Italy with streets of water. I saw an excavated castle in Crete. The best sight though was the Acropolis in Greece. Like I said there is so much to do.

If you like animals this will persuade you. In this job I get to spend all my time with animals! And there are animals you don't typically watch like horses and just different kinds of cattle. Also you can wacth them at any time because the animals are indoors. You can't beat this job.

This will persuade you if nothing else has. All you do in this job is travel. You get to travel totally free too. The only thing stopping people from traveling nonstop is the cost but here it is covered. You go all over the world as well. I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 18 times and the Pacific twice! This is my favorite part of the job I hope it is yours too.

You can't refuse being a Sea going Cowboy now. Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is the finance. You get paid to travel to all these amazing places. Boat travel is something a lot of people want to do but can't because of the price, however if you are a Seagoing cowboy you get paid to travel by boat. Lastly you save money because you don't need lots of accesories at home since you'll be traveling the world. This job has no flaws.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a blessing. My friend persuaded me to do this job years back. Now I am passing on the tradition and I hope you do too. Again help me in the Seagoing Cowboy program you won't regret it a bit.
