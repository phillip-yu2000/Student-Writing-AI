Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think all students should be required to do community service, because it's a good way to start learning now how to help the community. Also, it will allow students to be more active. it's also a way of making students and other student's the help feel better about themselves.

Learning how to help the community at a younger age is better for the student because as they get older they will know how important community service is and also how helpful it can be to the community. Most adults today don't help out the community because they weren't taught at a younger age that it's good to help out. A popular reason why many student's don't want to do community service is because it's not something they want to do. they think it takes too much work and too much time out of their day. what they don't know is community service doesn't always have to be something big that takes a lot of time out of there day. They can pick up trash around their neighborhood for 10 or 15 minutes a day.

It's a good way of helping kids be active and stay healthy and in good shape, and reduce the risk of health problems as they get older. maybe they can go for a productive jog with their dog while picking up trash. there are many way's you can help and have fun doing community service. it can also make students feel better about themselves.
