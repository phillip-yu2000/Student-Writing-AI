Some people ask multiple people for advice.

Maybe they just want to know other peoples' opinion's.

Also, they just wanted to here someone say what they said.

It could be that they wanted to talk to someone that has more experience.

Some people ask multiple people for help this strategy helps people decide because they want to know other people s' opinions, or they just wanted to here it from someone else, and maybe they wanted to talk to someone that has more experience.

Some people want to know other peoples opinion about the topic.

This helps by giving the person more options.

It also helps by seeing if they are even close to being correct.

This can also help by giving me another point of view to look at.

Thats one way to look at it but maybe i wanted to see a different way.

Maybe someone wanted to ask someone that is experienced.

Talking to someone experienced can help by showing someone how it went for them.

It could also help by letting me know what to do and what not to do not to do in a situation.

Finally, it could help by just showing me what i'm doing wrong.

There is another way i could get advice.

Also it could ne that i just want to hear my answer from someone else. This works because it gives me confidence. It also helps me stay with one thing instead of being off topic. It doesn't just give me confidence for now it gives me confidence for in the future. Finally time for the conclusion.

All of this things give good advice which helps us make better choices. Knowing peoples opinions helps a lot.

Having people that have experience to talk to is good. Plus just having someone say the same answer you have can give you a lot of confidence. Just having anyone at all to talk to and to get advice from is really good.
