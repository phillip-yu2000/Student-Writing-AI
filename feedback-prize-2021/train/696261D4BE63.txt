Should students be taught from home through a online device?

Some schools are now trying out online video for school communication. Online communication is video chatting through a device while learning school content.

This strategy would be really helpful and could extremely benefit students. Some students may deal with depression or anxiety, staying at home or a place they feel comfortable around less people can really help the students learn and understand school content.

Students may feel this situation beneficial and helpful to their learning because the student will not be face to face with peers, making It easier to understand the content because they wont be communicating with friends making it easier for students to stay focused to finish work on time. The students can communicate through a tablet, computer, or even a phone of choice.

Taking classes from home is the most efficient way of learning, you can be more comfortable and learn more efficient.

in conclusion online communication classes will encourage more students to achieve more without distractions.
