I think that they should develop these driverless cars. If they did, first of all, it would be cool to have cars that drive themsleves and second because if you needed to get somewhere and couldn't drive then you could. There are a few reasons why I think that they should be developed.

The first reason is because it would cost people a lot less to fill up their cars. They are also not fully driverless. They will alert you when you are pulling in or out of somewhere, or dealing with traffic issues such as construction or accidents. It feel that it could benefit a lot of people and would also make people more interested in driving.

They have been wanting to invent something like this one day. I knew that when they had the opportunity to create a vehicle or anything can can go on its own they would. This driverless car can apply brakes on individual wheels when needed too. It can also reduce power from the engine to help in the need of an emergency. This can help make driving safer because if someone isn't paying attention and a car or something is coming at you, your car can sense that and apply the brakes for you. It is nice that they are also considering using cameras in the cars to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. The car watches the driver and the driver watches the road.

Because of all the reasons I mentioned above, I think that they should develop the driverless car. It will be weird at first having these cars around because you wouldn't expect to see something like that but after a while it can benefit people in the long run that either can't drive like they used too and need to get somewhere, and also most will buy it just because it sounds super cool and to see what it can do.
