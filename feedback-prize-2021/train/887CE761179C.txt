Driverless cars really fasinates me. In the near we will be able to have cars that drive by themselves. In my opinoin this is a really good idea. There are some good reasons why this is a good idea. One reason why is it would make driving safe.

There are some examples that driverless cars would make driving safe. In the article states that it can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Also in the article it said it has special touch sensors to make sure the driver keeps hold on the wheel. Lastly these cars will have in-car entertainment and information systems to keep the driver having alittle fun time. Thought these systems will turn off automaticlly when the driver will have to take over and drive.

One reason why driverless cars is a good idea is that this will make driving safe. Reckless driving happens all the time everyday. For that reason driverless cars can use these special features to improve safer driving. For this it can decrease car accidents. In my opinion driverless cars is benifcal for everyone.
