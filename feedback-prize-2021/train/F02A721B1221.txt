Why do we ask many people for advice ? We ask so we can hear and learn new things . when you ask fora advice, you want to hear peoples opinions and thoughts on the situation.

When you hear people opinions, you start yo rethink your actions and answers. Different opinions might change your mind about the situation. Like for example, you could start a fight with your friend for no reason and think its right but other people might think its wrong, Hearing that people disagree might make you feel bad. The situation is done now but youÃÂ´ll make better choices next time.

When your asking for advice, you want to hear people thoughts o the situation. Hearing things that people can relate to is even better. Hearing things that people say will probably make you feel crazy or at your worse. Somethings you cant change but you make it better

In conclusion, we get advice from people so we can hear statements and relate to other people problems .
