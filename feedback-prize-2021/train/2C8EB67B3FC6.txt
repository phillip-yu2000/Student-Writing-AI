Have you ever wanted to just go out and explore? Being able to see diiferent life would be an amazaing thing to see. Many people want to explore many things, whether it comes with risk or not. The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," believes we should study Venus despite the dangers, snd I feel like we should, even though you don't know what is going to happen I feel like you should still take risk and explore, but there could also be more problems that come along.

In the article the author believes we should still go and explore Venus despite the risk that we could encounter. In the article it says, "These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth." Astronomers know what the conditions are like on Venus but still continue to want to go and explore it. Also in the article it says, "NASA's possible solution to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." They are making solutions to where scientists can go visit and explore Venus without having to deal with the extreme conditions.

The scientists are coming across more challenges than dealing with Venus' atmospere. In the article it says, "However, peering at Venus for a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere." With making up a solution to Venus' extreme conditions, there are now more problems that come across because of the solution that protects them from the major conditions.

In conclusion, scientist should go and study Venus disregaurding the major conditions. These scientist are very careful and aware of the risk of being on Venus, so they came up with a solution so they don't have to encounter the many harads. You should always go explore things you want to, but you should be aware of risk so you know what to do during the challenge of trying to explore somthing new.
