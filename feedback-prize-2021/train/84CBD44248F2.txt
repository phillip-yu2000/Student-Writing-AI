I think that policy 2 which is to not to allow cell phones at all is the best policy because the students would probably get a little carried away with policy 1 which is to allow students to use cell phones at lunch but not during class. Most students would think since the principal allows them to use there phones during lunch it would be okay to use them anytime they would like. Which is taking advantage of the privileges that they were allowed to do. In a school you must have strict rules or else the students will think that they can do whatever it is that they want to do. For example the students are glad they can use there cell phones at lunch but RELATIVE_NAME [example] decides since she can use here cell phone during lunch that she can use here phone in math class. The teacher catches her and then confiscates her phone. RELATIVE_NAME gets an attitude and then possibly the teacher goes to talk to the principle about the policy 1 because he has seen so many students that think its okay to us there phones whenever, and wherever. So policy 2 is the more responsible sensible policy[even though policy 2 sounds like a lot of fun].
