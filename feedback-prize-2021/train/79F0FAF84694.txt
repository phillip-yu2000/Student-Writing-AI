Driving or any moter transpertaion is a bad source to the enviroment. some people around the world help the planet by using car pools or bikes, and others ways to travel useing less gass and polloution to get around. And even countrys are helping out.

The data shown in the passage is that many poeple chose to sell there cars and chose to use other reasoures to get around. in the text it says , " when i had a car i  was always tense. im much happier this way". this qoute showes that having a car isnt as fun as people say. it can leave to stress and make people feel very tense. some people cant live without their cars , but others travel on bike and busses to not just do to do it, but to make a difference and help the earth. Data has been shown that the driving in America has decreased over the years and study shows that the driving by young people has decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. My response to this would be that all of this, is that people are trying to help and make for something better

Getting around without cars isnt just happening with small time people, Countrys are even getting involed. for example Paris, after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a patial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. motorists in paris with numbered license are told to leave there cars at home, if not they would have to suffer a 22-euro fine. this is a great way to allow less pollution go into the atomshere, this also helps everyone even if they dont know it. And not just paris has a car-free day, but Bogota , Colmbia use this as well. many colombians hiked , biked, skated or took busss to work during a car-free day. this helps our planet so much even if its a small thing it help little by little.

Many countrys do a great thing by doing this and it helps and even if the trip from A to B might take a little longer, its worth it. usage of cars being less used is a very important thing people do .
