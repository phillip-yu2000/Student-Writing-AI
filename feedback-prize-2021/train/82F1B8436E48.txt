Have you ever gave a person advice to make good choices?

when you give people adivce they think more about the situation.

3 good opinions to tell people that is make bad choices is make your mom proud, play sports, and stay away from negative energy.

The first good opinion is making your mom proud. and what I

mean by that is focusing on your school work and not getting in trouble inside and outside of school. There are a alot of people that is smart but just hang with the wrong crowd and that crowd get them in trouble.

The second good opinion is playing sport. When playing sports it keep you out the streets and the wrong. It also keep keep you out of trouble and it leads you up a good path in life. When you are good at the sport you play you can get a scolarship but you can not mess it up for your self because you want to hang with your friends.

The last good opinions staying away from negative energy.

When you do not stay away from negative energy it can get you killed or in jail. When you stay away from the negativity you do not have to worry about people trying to harm you. Focous on school and get As and Bs but even if the negativity is in your school just walk away or say " I dont feel like being bothered". Then you will not be around that negative energy no more.

Just listen to your family and friends when they are trying to help you be great in life. What they are telling you is good things that can keep you safe.
