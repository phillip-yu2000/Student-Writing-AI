I do think that having cell phones at school will be good because students have a hard time having fun when all they can do is work and that's it. when students can text there friends during school hours school will be less harsh and less boring because they will be able to text and call there friends during school and it will also relive some stress on them. also they will concentrate in class instead of just trying to text there friend during the class because they can do that after the class is over and wile there texting there friends there not interrupting the class in any way. were as if they text there friends in class they will most likely get caught and that will interrupt there and all of the classes work time. also when we are at lunch and we are board we don't have to sneak around texting and hiding from security guards and there will be less people having there parent come to school and pick it up and kids wont bring stuff there not aloud to bring because they have everything thing there aloud to have and what they want to have at school already. so there wouldn't be much of a problem having a cell phone at school. so please allow cell phones at our school during free time like before after school during passing periods and lunch
