The reason why I agree because I see a lot of people that do nothing all day. My three topics are kids need to learn more, kids need to be more athletic, and kids need to be more interactive.

I agree because if kids got to do extracurricular activites they can learn about what extracurricular activies does for you. Extracurricular activies helps kids work out and get exersize. Getting exersize is good for kids health. If kids got to work on extracurricular activies they would understaand a little bit more then what they did before.

I do not disagree because if kids got to be more athletic then kids would wanna play some sports like basketball or football. Kids would be able to do athletic things and still learn. Kids need to be more athletic because if kids are not athletic they would not wanna come to school and do the extracurricular activies. Kids come to school to have a social life and not work so if there is an extracurricular activies that give them a chance to be social and be athletic.

I agree because having extracurricular activies would be fun. havind extracurricular activies is going to be fun because everybody is going to be running around having a good time. If kids are having a good time that means that they would not mind if everybody had to do a extracurricular activies. Kids being more interactive is good because there are more willing to the extracurricular activies.

My three topics are kids need to learn more, kids need to be more athletic, and kids need to be more interactive. The reason why I put those down as my topic is because I see people all the time wishing they could have done something with their life.Â
