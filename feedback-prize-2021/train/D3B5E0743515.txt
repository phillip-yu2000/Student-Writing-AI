I am usually a bit skeptical about new technologies like the Facial Action Coding System, but I am opened to the idea of new technology. In this case I support the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. It is pretty interesting how the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can determine the emotion someone is feeling by examining the muscle movements in the face. The FACS could be a very usefull tool in many ways in the near future.

The FACS uses facial movents to determine whether a person is feeling happy, sad, surpised, angry, disgusted, fearful, or sad. The interesting thing about the FACS is that it can determine whether the person is faking an emotion. For example, the article stated," But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius". So by examining muscle movements in the face, the FACS can determine whether the person is faking an emotion or actually feeling it. In the future I think therapist could use the FACS to help determine how his/her patent is actually feeling. Dr. Huang stated," A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts."Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". I think that this would be an effective way to futher advance eduction in our society.

In conclusion, I agree with the use of the Facial Action Coding System. I believe it will help us advance as a society and make things less dificult. I feel as if the technology could be used in many ways besides schools. Many professions, such as pyscologist could use this technology.
