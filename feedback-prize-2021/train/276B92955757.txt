Dear School Administration:

Teenagers can not resist the "forbidden fruit". Teenagers want whatever they can't have. By allowing them to bring phones during lunch periods and free times, they are less likely to use their phones during class. If a student is caught using a cell phone in class, the school could ban all phones for one week. This is a privilege everyone wants, and no one would bring phones in class in order to keep that privilege. I think you should allow students to bring phones to school.

This privilege could also be used as a punishment. If a student does not do there homework they can't use there phones, or if the student is failing a class they can't use there phones. This method would encourage students to try in school and work harder. Phones could also be used as a reward. If a student finishes homework or class work early, they can use there phones for the last few minutes of class.

There are many ways to ensure students do not bring phones to class as well.

everyday teachers could have pocket checks in the beginning of class. Any student who had there phone with them can't use it during lunch and free times. This method would diminish the amount of phones during class. There could also be long term punishments. If a student has failed to complete a project, they can't use there phone until that project is turned in.

By admitting this policy, the school would have a friendlier environment. students would be looking forward to going to school. it would higher standard grades for the school, this could indirectly increase the schools annual fund. this policy would be greatly beneficial to the school. it would help not only students, but it would help teachers as well. That's why i think they should allow phones during lunch and free times.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
