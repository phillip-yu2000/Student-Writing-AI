I agree that people need to talk to more than one person for advise. People, like, adults know what they are talking about. Kids often think they can help but infact can make matters worse. People should ask multiple people for advise beacause some peole are much wiser than others, other people might have gine through some same situations as the person in need of help, some people might even know where to get more and helpful advise.

People should ask multiple people for advise because some people are much more wiser. They know what they are doing and know hoe to help out. They can help with making tuff choices for tuff situations. They can also help you on living a fun and safe life. Dont be scared to ask for help.

People might have gone through the same situations as the person in need of help. They can teach them how to prevent bad things happening. How to make life more fun and opened. How to make life interesting and successful and even. How to feel free.

Often people give us advise , but some people know where to get even more, helpful advise. We can learn many different things about our lifes and our world. Life is not easy so it's better to get help than to struggle. You can make life easy all you need is a little more help and someone to guide you. There is never too much help in this world.
