The U.S. should change to popular vote instead of Electoral Collage to elect a president. Some reasons why are a persident can win even if he/she is not popular with the people and the electors of the Electoral collage can go against the will of the people.

The first reason we should change this is the persident could win even if he/she is not popular with the people. The president could win the popular vote but lose the Electoral Collage vote. A good example of this is the 2000 election between Gore And Bush Where gore won the popular vote but bush won the electoral collage vote. This means that in order to win presidency you must win the biggest states or the most states not the most people.

Another reason is that the Electoral Collage can go against the will of the people. The electors can vote for the oposite canidate than the people voted for. this is because the electors have free will when it comes to voting. Instead of who the people want for president the electors could vote for who they want.

These are only some of the many reasons that the electoral collage sould be Abolished. The whole system is just unreliable and makes it easier for politicians to sway the vote.Â
