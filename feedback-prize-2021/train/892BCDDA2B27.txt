Dear State Senator

As it may have come to yourn notice I would like to foucus your attention to the debate about the Electoral Collage. The Electoral Collage is a unfair process the fathers of the Constintution established. As you know it is a "Compromise between electon of the President by a vote in Congress and eletion of the President by popular vote." (Source 1) In other words the Electorial Collage is where we elect represintives to vote for the president. That then makes their vote more important then everyone elses. And let me tell you, you wouldnt want that.

The Electoral Collage was a structure our founding fathers set up to help formally elect the president. But if this process goes aginst the wishes of the people, the ones the Constitution was writen for, then what purpose does it serve? " Its official: The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational." (Source 2) Once the Electoral Collage has be  abolished the president can then be elected by popular vote and every one will be satisfided.

"The Electoral College is widely regarded as a anashronism" (Sourse 3) This means that the Electoral Collage is a thing that seems to belong in the past and does not fit in the present. Im sure that our founding fathers had good intions when they installed this system into our goverment. But times has changed since then,and we need to abolish the Electoral Collage so we can have a simpler system that almost every one agrees with. I relize that you have a tight schedule so its alright if i dont Resive a Resbonding letter. Insteed I ask that you use that time to consider what I have presented to you today.

Sinserly
