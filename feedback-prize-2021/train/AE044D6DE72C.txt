So scientist's have researched and discovered that when someone is making a hard choice, people often ask others about their opinions. Therefore scientist's have also found that when the person gets other peoples opinions, that the person normally chooses the better opinion and makes the better choice. Also when you get other people's opinions you get more and more knowledge about the choice that you are about to make. Another thing is when the person gives you their opinion don't deny their opinion, you need to listen to what they have to say and don't just ignore them.

Secondly, you should never let someone encourage you to make a choice, but you should let someone tell you their opinion that away you know what you might like and want you don't like. For example say that your going out and looking for a job you might ask your friends that worked at one of the jobs that you are looking at, and they might tell you their opinion about the job. So then you can go and research about the job and see if you like it or not, then now you are ready for the job and you now know what to kinda expect.

Furthermore, sometimes it might be good to ask your friends for their opinion on things, but other times it might not be the best time. Like say that you want to go to a football game with one of your friends, but your friend doesnt like the football teams that you are going to watch so that might not be a good time to ask for your friends opinion. So some of the time you might have to make your own choice and you might not be able to ask for your friends opinion.

Lastly, honestly when your making like a major decision in your life, I would honestly use your gut to make the choice instead of asking for your friends opinion. Then other times when it's not such a major decison then I would maybe ask your friends. So just remeber the next time your making a big or small decision maybe ask your friends for their opinions first then make the decision.
