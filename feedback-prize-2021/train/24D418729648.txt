I think that is a great idea because we all should have good grades. Certain people deserve to be on any kind of sport because of the way they act and they think that, they are not going to get in trouble for it. People should at least have a b average because those people might have a c and they still act a fool in class . So i agree with the principal because my opinion is true to me because i know and i have seen. People just know what they doing sometimes because they just want to see how far they can take it to the teacher and sometimes they won't get in trouble. It's ok to be in a sport but if you don't want to show your fans the way you act instead of the way that you do on purpose. This my opinion so the principle should really read this because this happens in our school sometimes.
