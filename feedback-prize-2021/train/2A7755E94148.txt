The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" writes about about the many problems us humans have with exploring venus. But he also throws in there reasons why we should support the studying of Venus, and I agree with them on it and here's why.

First we need to out what claims the author made that support the idea of exploring and studying Venus. Firstly, the author points out that long ago Venus was most likely like Earth in the fact that it probably had water and lifeforms on it's surface. And they also point out that Venus is the closet option for a planetary visit. Here's my problem with the authors claims, and that is that they have no hard proof or that they don't go into detail. For example, the author theorizes that there were lifeforms and water on venus, but we have no proof for either of those statements. The author also claims that the value of returning to venus is indisputable even though the problems with returning outnumber the benefits.

I believe that we should look into returning to Venus, however I don't believe that it's a high priority mission or goal that we need to accomplish, because of the problems we are currently facing on our own planet.
