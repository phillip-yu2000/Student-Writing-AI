Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I feel that we the students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. Some students need cell phones because their parents need to know when they get out of school. Parents pick up their children from school when they leave. Suppose that a student has to suddenly stay late for basketball practice. If the student doesn't have a cell phone, when the parent comes when they usually do, the student won't be there to be picked up. Thus, resulting in the student not having a ride home.

Students should be able to use their phones during free time. Now with all the social network sites like Facebook and Twitter, students want to be able to be updated on what's going on. Also students like to surf the web and go on Youtube and do other enjoyable things. The students would get a chance to text or email other friends that may not be at the same school. I feel that it will give the students, like myself , a sense of independence being able to use phones.

Now I know why you may want students to not use phones. Students can cheat on tests by looking online or texting. Also you don't want students to text during class and other times when they shouldn't. That's why after lunch and free times you should do a cell phone check to see if the students turn off their phones. If you were to find at least 50 phones on, then you can take cell phone days away for a week. To me that sounds like a fair exchange.

All in all I hope you decide to go with policy 1. It is a better and more fair choice for the student body. Please take this letter in consideration. Thank you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
