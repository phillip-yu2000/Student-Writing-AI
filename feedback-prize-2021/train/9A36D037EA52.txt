In todays world students often get board in a classroom. Therefor students dont pay atention when the teather is teaching. The result of them not paying atention leads to them getting bad grades. It would make a great diffrence if schools would use the FACS. There are many reasons why schools should be useing FACS but here are some of the main reason.

One of the reasons schools should be using FACS is because it would be able to tell if someone was getting frusterated and were to imbarest to ask for help. If teacher knew that one of their students were getting upset with something they would be able to help them to complet there assiment and not just sit there and not do it. If they did not use this they could not tell if the student was getting upset and didnt know how to do somthing and didnt fell comfortable asking for help in front of the class.

Another reason is they could tell if the students were liking the subjust that they were on. The teacher would be able to see if the students were likeing the way that the teacher was teaching thing so the teacher would know for the next years. This would improve the students grades by the teacher knowing how the students like to be tought.

Last but not least the teacher could tell if something was going on either outside of schools or in school. The teacher would be able to tell if they were upset and they could ask them what was wrong and they could try to help solve the problem. This could improve grades as well by helping the student foces more and help them not be upset.

If the schools were to use FCAS they should would become a better place for students to learn. The schools would become higher in rank because the studente would get better grades. there for FACS should be used in schools.
