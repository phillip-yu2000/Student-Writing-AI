Have you ever asked more than one person for help on what product to buy in a situation? Interviews are a perfect example of seeking more than one opinion. Interviews are seen on the news, in professional sports, and other places as well. There are a lot of people that can help you buy the right product as well. They can all open you up to new ideas. I think talking to more than one person on an opinion is a better choice because it shows you more than one option, it can change your perspective of a topic, and it informs you about what other people enjoy.

First, I think it shows you more than one option. One opinion of a person might destroy your choice on an option rather than opening it up. The whole point of asking what is the better choice, is to make it better, not worse. You could already have the better opinion, and that person might ruin it, but more people would give you a good balance of what you need to know. Multiple opinions can stride you toward different answers. Different answers will most of the time make things go in the right direction. Its good to show variety in what you're going to pick in order to get the best choice. One opinion could be someone who isn't informed on the idea. They might not know anything about the topic and might just state a random answer. That can really throw you off if you don't get more ideas than just that one person. That can have the same effect as what I said before. That one person could mess it all up for you. All of the people you ask shows you more than what you thought was the best choice.

Next, it can change your perspective on the topic. One person can change your option, but it may not lead you in the right direction. That direction could make you unhappy with your choice if you are comparing a product to see which one to get. You could take that one persons advice and follow it, but it might not be the best advice you could get. Multiple people have a better chance of leading you to the right opinion. When you get the opinion of multiple people, it balances out what might be the favorite option, or what might be the better option. A lot of times, changing your opinion is for the better. You could be looking at the wrong choice, and multiple opinions might lead you to the right path. It gives new ideas and ways to look at a situation and make the right choice. It can make you change your opinion.

Finally, it informs you about what other people enjoy. Having more than one person's opinion might lead to an agreement with those people. You could be really stuck on a certain product you are trying to buy, and someone could save that entire situation by finding a good version of that product. You could also learn more about culture and peoples opinions in a certain area, or a certain time. Many people are different and sometimes that is based off of the environment around them, and where they grow up that could affect what a person likes. If you ask multiple people in the same area you grew up in, you should be leading yourself to the right choice. It can also lead to meeting new people, and making new friends. You could agree on an opinion and start a bond there. It all helps you on knowing not only what you like, but what a lot of other people like.

In conclusion, finding more than one persons view is better because it shows more than one opinion, it can change your own opinion, and it can inform you on what other people enjoy. If you are ever interviewing people, or looking for advice from other people to make the right decision, make sure you ask multiple people andÂ not just one person for that advice! I always ask friends, family, or other people for help and advice if I should do something or not. You've probably asked multiple people for advice as well!
