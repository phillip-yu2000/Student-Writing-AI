Dear TEACHER_NAME

i strongly disagree with your policy of not having students participate in school physical activities unless they have a B average. Because most of the participants who would like to participate have a C average and this would hurt your population of athletes at the school. The school sports teams would have to forfeit. And a C average is not that bad if u said than no F average students that would be acceptable because most schools do have that policy .but not C average because that just hurts your chances of winning any competitions or even competing in any sports at all .I have talked with C average students and they are very disgruntled and angry about not being able to be on the team. RELATIVE_NAME in seventh grade said "I love playing soccer at school but i cant because i have straight C I mean I am trying but they wont let me on the team." so TEACHER_NAME please from the whole school lower the grade requirement?

sincerely the whole school.
