Don't some things sound too good to be true? Well, this is one of many. NASA scientists have found a "face" on Mars. This has been solved to be just a landform, but some people still believe that the "face", was created by aliens. Here are some facts to prove that this is a natural landform.

First of, in 1976, pictures were not the best back then. We were still working on them to make the outcome look better. With the digital images being 3 times bigger than the pixals, you are bound to find something that is not what it seems to be. Also, the "face" is located 41 degrees north martian laditude. This is a more foggy area of the planet. This could explain why the picture looks like a "face". Also, there were other objects around the "face" that casted shadows on the landform, making it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. This landform is very similer to landforms in the West of the U.S. This would be called a mesa. Finally, the scans of the "face" can only go so far. Plus, the camera doesn't go over the face often either.

Even since cameras have been upgraded for a better picture, NASA can prove that this is not an alien made "face", but a natural landform on Mars.
