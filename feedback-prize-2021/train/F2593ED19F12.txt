I believe that students should not have the privilege to use cell phones at school because if the students were able to have there cell phones at free periods they would become to much of a distraction for the students to be able to concentrate, and they would just have that urge to check there phone or they would even check there cell phone for that matter. And that is not fair to the student because he or she should have an equal amount of education. It also wouldn't be fair to the students in the surrounding area or the teacher who has spent he or she's time making the lesson plans.

My second reason why

I believe students should not have cell phones out at all is because cell phones are also a way drama can very easily get started , because you can just start texting and rumors can get spread faster.

Theses are my main two reasons why I believe students shouldn't have a cell phone privilege on school grounds.

Hope theses reasons are taken into consideration
