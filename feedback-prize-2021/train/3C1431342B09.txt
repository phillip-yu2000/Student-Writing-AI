Dear principal,

I don't think you should do that because sports is what drives us to make good grades. and if u take that away we wont have anything else. Yes i understand you want to see better grades but for some kids its not that easy. They are either dxlicic or don't understand. i personally think if you give them a little tutoring that will make a great improvement. For examples staying after school and go in the morning. All they need is a little push. but hopefully you understand that we need sports. Without sports we don't have anything. Who knows we might take off and have excellent sports careers. Yes i know grades are important to but having problems about schoolwork is hard too. All we have to do is work hared and sports pushes us to do that. Like they say "no pass no play". Have you ever had something taking away from you and you felt like there's nothing else to work for? Well that's how we will feel if u take away sports. i promise you we will do better in our grades. Heck if they go to tutorials i will go to help them out. There is another thing teachers might teach their lessons in way a student might not understand but if another student helps out he might understand. And a c average is not that bad. when it becomes an f that's where can talk about it. But for now a c average is good. Its not great but it sure is good. And i know if we work even harder and come to tutorials we will do better. Hope you had a great time reading this letter and hope you have a great day!

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
