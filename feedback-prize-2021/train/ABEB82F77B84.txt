Dear Principle,

By not letting students without a B average not play sports will cause many problems. Some kids just are not that smart, but are very good at a sport. It will decrease the amount of kids playing in sports as well. I could understand if they were about failing, not letting them play, but a B average is outrageous.

Some kids are very athletic in our community. They are not very smart but they meet the requirements to play. If you changed this , there would not be as many kids playing in sports.

We may not even have a sports team because we don't have kids playing. this may not just be in sports either.

It may also affect kids in band and other extra curricular activities. Kids will be devastated at this fact. The thing they love is gone because of their grade. Although it will help the kids strive to do better in school, but it may cause them to not care anymore and give up.

We already have problems with the C average, if you change it to a B, it will cause even more problems.
