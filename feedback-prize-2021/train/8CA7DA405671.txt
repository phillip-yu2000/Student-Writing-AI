I am writing a letter to you, Principal, stating that I am against your decision to change the school policy. Requirements to have a B average to play sports is clearly un-fair to the whole student population, including the A average kids. Most of the students have a C average in this school, so bringing that new rule in would kick most of the kids out and ruin your school. Here are some reason why that would happen

Having a C in class is normal, and having a B is above average and should not be expected form kids. All of them need exercise to stay healthy and should not have to deal with this pressure to be above a normal mind. Getting all those kids kicked out of P.E would mean they have to go some where in the school, so in other words, means you are going to over flow the classes with kids and most of your teachers would most likely quit if that is done. No offence to you sir, but this is a horrible thing to do.

For example, there was once a time I had the same problem before believe it or not. When i was little my mom would not let me go outside and play unless i had a B (or higher) in all classes. After some time has passed I started getting worse in my classes. Not getting exercise has been making me feel lazy and caused me to fail in Science class, i was not used to carrying objects around so the equipment fell to my feet and broke, my mom saw here mistakes and let me play outside again. Making this rule come to life would not only make one kid like this, it would make most of the school like that.

Trying to convince you is like fighting a lion. Its hard, but not impossible! I advise you to heed my warning, this shall not go well (not threatening you) and will ruin the school and your job. I'm not only saying this to help myself and other students out, I'm also doing it for you, teachers, and our school. So, for those reasons and more, that is why i think you should not make this change to school policy.
