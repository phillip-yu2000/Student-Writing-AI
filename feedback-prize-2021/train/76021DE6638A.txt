Using drivless cars in the future would not a good thing because, it is pointless to have a car that drives itself but still needs the assiant of the driver when the road gets compilcated, and it is a safety issue.

In paragraph seven it says, "The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs." With this being said the driverless cars are practicually usueless because there is no need for them to be driverless if the driver still needs to be alert and aware when to take over.

Paragraph eight reads, "We have ti interpret the driving fun in a new way." "Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feautire, and safety is a big concern." This means that if the driver is disctracted and the neccasry warning senesors where to be turned off, the driver can end up a terrible accident.

There for having driveless cars may come with postive perk but the nagitve perks do out top the postive.
