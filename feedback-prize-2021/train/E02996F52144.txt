Luke is about eighteen years old. He is a Seagoing Cowboy. This is someone who takes care of young cattle, horses, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke had made NINE of these trips, thats the most a Seagoing Cowboy ever has!

**** 9:45 a. m.****

"Hi, I'm Luke I am a Seagoing Cowboy!!!!"said Luke to the other towns people.

The people begin to walk away from the crowd with people yelling and shouting to Luke how boring he is and quiet. Luke felt bad because of this so he started to talk again.

"People listen up, I am here to make a statement. That would be why I called everyone here today."

Someone shouts from the crowd. "Get on with it little boy this taking up some of our presious time!!!!"

"I would like to persaude all the young boys AND girls to become a Seagoing Cowboy, if you would like to be a Seagoing Cowboy please raise your hand and I promise you, you will have a GREAT TIME!!!!! You will get to pet animals and visit castles and other great things like that so does anyone want to raise their hand now, Oh and you will get paid!!!!!"

About all the boys and girls raised their hand. The parents and or gardians because they were either poor or greedy. And wanted and/or needed the money. Many of those children joined but Luke wasn't quite done.

**** two weeks later****

He desided to take those children on one of his tours that he got to go on. The trip to the castle!!!!

"Okay guys here we are you can take off those blindfolds I gave you!" They listened to him and took off the blindfolds they were given. And there it was the one thing they had all been waiting for, the castle!!!!!

Once Luke and the children got home they talked about the payments per week they will get five dollar bills. This excited all the children. They were so, so, so happy to here that news.

When the childre grew old they no longer went overseas. Even though the loved their jobs, they just had to retire.
