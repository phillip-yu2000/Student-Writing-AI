Dear Principal ,

well i think you should let anyone do sports or activities even if they have a low grade because it is not fair to the kids with low grades what if they love sports and they cant be in it cause you wont let them that wont be fair they might think that you dislike them or something . you should just let anyone join sports maybe there good in sports but not in there school work but they can raise up there grades if you have a talk with them . you should listen to what the students have to say before you don't let them participate in the sports . it is not fair if only kids with a b participate in sports or activities even if they have a c they should be able to participate anyone should be able to participate . some students are great on sports and they might have bad grades or a c and there not going to be able to get it and participate that's not fair they might get mad and scream at you . so i think you should let everyone participate in sports and activities so you can be fair .
