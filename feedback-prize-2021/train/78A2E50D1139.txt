Dear State Senator,

I would like to favor on changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United Sates because it's a more reliable way of voting who our president should be because everyone in the sate who votes know who they are voting for. We, the voters, are not voting for for our President, but for a slate of electors, people who may or may not vote for who we wanted to win. Its a very tricky method of voting and we believe we should'nt use that method anymore. Also, people who are voting may not have enough knowledge on electors and vote for the wrong electors. I would also like to address the 2000 fiasco, which is the biggest election crisis in the cenurty; the systen allows for much worse. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so that those votes for Kennedy, would not go to him. It is a really unrealiable and unfair way for the citizans to vote for who they would want tto represent this country.
