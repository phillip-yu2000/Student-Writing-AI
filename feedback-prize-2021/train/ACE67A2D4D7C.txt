"Making Mona Lisa Smile," with the facial action coding system, is a way of a computer being able to read a humans emotions, isnt it kind of weird? technology is progressing more and more everyday, but this isnt something we need, why do we need to read peoples emotions? is it important?

This program allows other people to invade the privacy of others, i would want someone or something reading my emotions just because, even if who ever is trying to "read" your emotions asked for permission its still called personal space, this program to me is kind of useless, maybe there are some ways it could be useful?

In some cases it can be used for people in the hospital, you know when you go get checked up the doctor normally asks you how you feel, and sometimes you dont know how you feel but the doctor needs to know in order to treat you.

But in some other cases, it should not be used in schools or in working areas, dont you think that the students will kind of be scared of that? theres no use for it, maybe some people will make use out of it but some people dont want you "reading" their emotions at all, and you have to respect that.
