The principal decided that all students must participate in at leas one extracurricclar activity. In the other hand i strongly disagree with this decision. Some people mait want to acshuly do a extracurricular activity and thats find. Is wen the make othe people that dont want to do it , that wea i disagree.

For exampol, students can do sports. What about if they dont have the money beacus mous esports you have to but things like soccer for soccer you need soccer cleats, Or they jues dont have the healp beacau they mait be fat of someting eals so the dont have the capasati of being abol of plaing a sport. In many caises they jues dont fell like play a spor expesioly if they arent geting nthing out of it.

to do a extracurricular actirity you need time. But what about if you dont have time. But what about if you can do that extracurricular activity beacus you have to go home to cean the haues. Or you jues can stay afthe school beacus you have to do stufe home or thers a amergai. But one of the mous importan tings is homwork if you n a spor time you can do your homework beacus you are going to get home lait at night unless you stay up all nigth doing it. Or what about if you have to stady for a importan teast that you have the next day.

I know many people mait wnt to paly sports and healp with the year book and that find. But its not find wen they are maiking us do some ting tha we mait nasesary want to do. So thats why i disagree with the principal and tank that not evry estudent need to do a extracurricclar activity. And that why i diagree and you shud to.Â
