Dear Principal,

I think that you should not change the policy to participate in sports from a C average to a B average because there are a lot of students who do not do so well in school and love playing sports and they already have a tough time keeping grades up so they could continue playing sports. Now if you change it to a C average they will have tougher time keeping there grades. I like participating in playing sports and I don't do that well in school. If you change the policy I am not going to be able to play sports and I am going to have a tougher time keeping my grades up.

Another reason is that you will crush the dreams of students becoming professional players and that is one of the biggest goals of many students who like playing sports and if they can't keep up there grades they won't be able to practice or if they are really good people won't notice them , and don't you want your students to be a successful person in life? Then they could be successful by being a professional player.

So please don't change the policy, just let students go out there and have fun by playing sports and representing there school , or chasing there dreams on becoming professional players. So hopefully this letter changes your mind about changing the policy.
