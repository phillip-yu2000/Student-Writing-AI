Of the many planets in our solar system, Venus would be the worst to travel to. This planet is highly dangerous. The conditions are horrendous, and some people are thinking of traveling there. The cost of building a ship capable of withstanding Venus's conditions would be crazily high. The fact that the author would want to travel to, and support the idea of, Venus is outrageous. Even then, they did not support their claim too well in their article.

Venus is the second planet from the sun. Accoring to the text, the surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also, the planet has many earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and often has many lightning strikes that take down probes that wish to know the secrets of the surface. Pressure levels are also off the charts and could crush the ship anyone was travelling in.

The author of the text was not too convincing of their claim to explore Venus. The title itself does not help the claim either This planet, as said by the author, is very dangerous. Traveling to Venus and making sure conditions are suitable for people, is not very achieveable. The author seems to want to travel there and supports the idea, but they do not support their claim very much. Most of the article talks about how perilous the planet is for people to travel to. They could have supported themselves better if they talked about the benefits instead of only the dangers.

All in all, travelling to Venus would be a waste of time and money. If NASA risks the lives of people by sending them, then the trip would be for nothing. With the dangrous conditions to consider, the contemplation of whether or not to travel there is out of the question. The answer is no. It's too unsafe to put peoples' lives on the line only because scientists are curious about a dangerous planet.
