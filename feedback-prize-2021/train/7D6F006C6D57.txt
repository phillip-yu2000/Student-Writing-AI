Should people be allowed on their phone while driving?

I think they shouldn't because that causes a lot of wrecks and other bad things. 26% of car wrecks are caused by the driver being on their phone and not paying attention. When you're driving and on your phone at the same time you're risking other people lives and yours too. There should be a new law that says there should not be any electronics placed in a moving vehicle. Plenty of people been killed in an accident because some careless human being decides to drive and text and take their eyes off the road.

Another thing if you're going to have your phone in your car turn it on do not disturb or silent so when you receive a phone call or text you will not be distracted. If you get caught by the police texting while driving there should be a huge fine to make people learn their lessons. Texting while driving is basically like drunk driving either way there's an accident that's about to happen, but it can never lead up to that point if you just put the phone down.

All it takes is just one little glance at your phone then BOOM!! An accident you just created. Just do everyone a favor and put the phone on hold. There's been a lot of innocent people dying because someone wants to be irresponsible and text while driving.
