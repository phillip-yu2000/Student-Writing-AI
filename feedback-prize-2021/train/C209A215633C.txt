Dear principal,

How are you ?

I think policy 1 is good for our school, because as long as you let us use our phone in lunch time and other free time and when its time to go to class we could just turn them off and get started in class. Students will think its great to use their phone when its free time. When we get to class and turn off our phones the class wont be stoped in the middle of class and have to take their phone. Students will get mad for taking their phone away in class for not letting them use it on free time Students will thank you for letting them use their phones. Policy 1 is a really good cause because what if its emergence and they have to call their mom after school and you said that we aren't allowed to bring phones to school. So, then how are they going to call their mom.

So, think through about what I said about policy 1. So, what do you think about policy 1 ? Is it good for our school are not ?

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME,
