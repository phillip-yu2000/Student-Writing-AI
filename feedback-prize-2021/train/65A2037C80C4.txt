Dear Senator, my name is PROPER_NAME and I think we should change the popular vote because us voters aren't even voting for a president and that is not right. That's just saying we have no freedom of anything because we aren't really citizens of the United States Of America. We aren't citizens because we can't even vote for our own president so how are we supposed to be "proud americans?" These electors can defy the will of us "proud americans". "And that those electors could always defy the will of the people."

The state legislatures are responsible for this happening. "Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors." Here's an example of what almost happen to president John F. Kennedy. "Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." This was a way of not giving John F. Kennedy his earned votes. "(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"

These electors do not even vote for the people their party's candidate and cast. They vote for whomever they please. "In the same vein, "faithless" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...." Richard Nixton tried to cheat also. "Oh, and if a state sends

two

slates of electors to congress?" this is what happened. "It happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the Sentate, validated only his opponent's electors, but he made sure to do so "without establishing a precedent."

this is why we should change the popular vote. There is too much cheating and mischief.
