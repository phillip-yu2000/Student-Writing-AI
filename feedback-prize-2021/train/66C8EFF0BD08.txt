Dear Principle,

I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion about the cell phone policy.

I don't see a reason to ban cell phones on campus, because some parents require their children to stay in contact with them. I think its very important to have a cell phone because if you have to stay in for detention, for example, and there is a very long line to use the office or classroom phone. There is always a plan b, Your phone. Or even in emergencies, like if you forgot your lunch money, or an assignment for one of your classes. Cell phones are useful in some ways. Some teachers might think cell phones interfere with learning, but really for me safety is first. If your thinking of letting have cell phones thank you, if not its your decision. Thank you for letting me have some of your time to express my feelings about the cell phone policy.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
