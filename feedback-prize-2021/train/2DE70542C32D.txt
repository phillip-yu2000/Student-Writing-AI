Hey, I'm Luke. I'm here to tell you about the Seagoing Cowboys program. I was a Seagoing Cowboy myself. It was a very unique experience. On the plus side, I also had a lot of spare time. I got to see Europe and China. My friend and I got to help a lot of people during our time, too. There is also time to play around on the boats after you unload all the animals. I loved to play volleyball and baseball. Also, we played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling.

The program helped open up my eyes. It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It might be a little hard at first ,and rough, but you'll get the hang of it. After all that, just think of how good you'll feel after knowing you've helped people. Signing up for the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity for you. If you like to have spare time, help people, and have a lot of fun, Seagoing Cowboys is the job for you. Participate today!
