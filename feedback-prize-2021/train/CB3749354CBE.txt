My opinion about the schools new policy of having students with at least a B average to participate in sports is something I would agree on. Sports is like an award for some students who is very active, works hard and puts a lot of effort into their class work. They should deserve a little time to be in something every kid enjoys if they're active. I wouldn't disagree because it wouldn't be fair at all to have kids who don't work hard in school and fools around all day to be joining in fun activities, because it makes them concentrate less in class work and makes them worry more about the activities that's assigned for them in school that has nothing to do with reading, writing and etc.

Even though sports is healthy for kids, a lot of students should be able to attend to those activity's but its worth working hard to earn it.

If a student really wants to join a sport activity, they should work hard and earn something that they really want in order to achieve that. On the other hand, it makes them want to do their work which is a good opportunity because they'll be used to it and concentrate more often till the student gets that chance to be an activity. And thats my opinion about the new sports rule in school.
