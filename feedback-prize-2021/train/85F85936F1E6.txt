Dear principal,

I think community service is very helpful in life. I think you should require it to everyone who wants to do it and if they don't, that's there loss. I personally think it helps people do much better in life because you are doing something nice for your life and helping out the environment. Its very nice to help people who get stuck or fall and can't get up and you would help them they would think wow what a very nice kid. I have to say I have done it before help someone up when they have fallen. They have looked at me with a great big smile and thanked me. I just love seeing big smiles on peoples faces, it brightens my day and makes me feel like I have done something right for once.

Its so easy to through something away weather than littering. I mean come on it is not that hard to get up and through away your garbage and if your to lazy to do that well then I would say wow that is just not good. Your to lazy to through something away but your not lazy when it comes to going somewhere with friends or texting. When you get a texts your like oh someone wants to talk to me I better respond. All I want to say is doing community service would be a great way to getting people together and helping clean or pick up liter in the park. You should always bring a friend because you would get bored very easily and having as friend makes it 10 times better than doing it by yourself.

I hope you read my letter because i would really like it if you would put together a community service group. I would mean the world to me and some others who also like doing community work. The others may not like it and think its dumb but you can just say I'm doing something great for the world and your not. I hope my letter changes things :).

Love your student,
