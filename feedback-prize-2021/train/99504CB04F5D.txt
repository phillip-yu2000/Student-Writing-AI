As technology has advanced, our methods of transportation have advanced with it. Driverless cars are things of the future, just as regular cars were a thing of the future in the 1900s. There will always be risks and certain safety regulations just as with regular cars but having the technology and not using it would be taking a step back.

The use of driverless cars may seem lazier or seem to have more risks than a manual car but is that not what people once thought about regular cars? Cars already start themselves and can be put in a self driving setting, so a full time driverless car would be a step in the right direction and be all around safer for citizens and drivers everywhere. Having technology run your car rather than a human, the risk and chance of a wreck would decrease dramatically. Although as of now a malfunction in the technology that could cause a crash and whether the manufacturer or the driver is to blame is a blurry topic the restriction of testing the cars would never give them the opportunity to fix the problems. Progress is slow as shown in 2013 when BMW announced the "Traffic Jam Asssistant," which can only function up to 25 mph which wouldn't be nearly enough to drive on actual roads yet but the progress is still there. The lack of states on board with the test driving of these cars is restricting the chances for improvement.

We, as humans, sometimes give up on things we see as impossible but things we think of as normal now seemed impossible 50 years ago. Driverless cars are simply an advancement that we're ready to make and improve but we limit ourselve sin our own abilities. It may be 20 years from now but eventually in the baby steps being taken drvierless cars will see the roads.
