Wow! That middle school in San Bernardino has a basket ball and soccer team and they all have C' s and D' s. A. Our school should have sports teams because it gives us a chance to demonstrate our athleticism. It also helps us meet friends from our school we didn't even know were here. It might even give us a chance to win trophies for the school.

The first reason is that it helps us show our athleticism and keep us in shape. If the school decides to band sports, mostly all the kids will have to be sitting down in a chair trying to get a higher grade. This will cause Americas youth to not be in shape and not have any physical activities in school. Even the famous people in the world didn't have good grades while they were in school.

Another, reason is that we meet new people from different schools or even from ours. While the school is traveling the city playing different schools we meet new kids and play as a team to beat them. When we win it also gets us closer to winning a trophy. This year we didn't even know the basket ball team and now every body knows them. Almost the whole school goes to see them play in games away from here.

Principals and teachers think they will save money on banning the sports to lower level kids but they are wrong. They will still have to pay for the people that are still on the team for uniforms and sport balls to play with. If the principal doesn't change any rules they will pay as much for the whole team than just half of it. This will decision would make the school loose money instead of gain, because they would have bought basket balls and other sport accessories and wouldn't even use them.

Wow our school is loosing that
