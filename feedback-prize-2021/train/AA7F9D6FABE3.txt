Yes i believe students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. most students need to talk to there parents some time threw out the day while there at school because most play sports and need to see if they have a ride. I also believe that they should let students because if they say you are allowed then they probably will not get it out as often because they wouldn't be as tempting. It may even help with the problems they have to try to work out with the teacher about finding a ride or wonting to ride home with some one else such as a friend. iv often had problems were i didn't know who to ride home with or what to do and it forced me to sneak out my phone and text my parents because 98 percent out of the time the teacher teals you to wait till your next class but that teacher says the same thing. It really isn't that big of a problem at our school,

not many of the students have phones or cant afford. Another reason is because when you are on break or at lunch you have a lot of free time and usually nothing to do, but with that rule changed they could play games on there phones or show other students pictures they have taken, I also see why the rule is no phones. im sure there will be some students try to say there phone got stolen or they lost it or some one broke it and stuff but that stuff doesn't happen often if you are acting mature. But if the rule happened to be changed then it would keep a lot of problems from starting.
