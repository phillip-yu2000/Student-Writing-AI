Driveless cars are the next step in the future, but are they the safest step? Google has been working on these cars for a long time and have had cars that work properly since 2009. With all the technology in the world today it is possible to make these cars, but like cellphones and other devices cars can make mistakes or malfunctions causing the car and person inside to be in danger. If the car were to go wrong, the makers of that car could get in a lot of trouble. Instead of driverless cars to save fuel, there should just be regular cars that are more fuel efficiant. This will keep car companies in buisness, people safer, and driverless car companies out of trouble.

If driverless cars were made, not every company could keep up with these cars. Everyone would want the newest thing and it would cause the smaller car companies to go out of buisness. Making cars that save more fuel would be easier for the smaller comanies to supply than making driverless cars. Driverless cars could also go wrong and put people in danger. If the person was seriously injured, people would see that and not want to buy the cars. This makes all the money the companies spent on cars go to waste because the driverless cars went out of style. Lets say a person was to get injured off a driverless car. That person could then sue the company because they were not the ones driving, the car was. Driverless cars are a bad idea.

Driverless cars should not be made but instead cars saving more fuel should. Cars like a Prius are getting around 50-55 miles every gallon which is amazing. If car manufactions made other models of cars getting the same or close to the mileage that a Prius gets, traveling would be a lot easier. Even though google has been working on these cars for so long, nothing is perfect. There will always be some glitch in a system that could cause the car to go wrong. Driverless cars should not be used and people should stick to regular cars that we use today.
