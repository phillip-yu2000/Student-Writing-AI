Their are some schools that offer distance learning as an option, So that means you can be at home or if you live in a different state and want to attend a school out of state you can apply for distance learning if that school has that option. If you dont have the money or is scared to move away from family and friends you can just stay home and work from there. Also if you don't have the money to move closer to the school you want to attend distance learning would be a very good idea if you really are dedicated to that school.

I think distance learning is a great idea because you can make your set up your own class schedule and times that you want to attend those classes so it doesn't interfere with your job or family time. Also you don't have to worry about how you look or dress because you aren't leaving your home. Although if you choose to do video conferences you would have to look presentable to your teachers and peers. You also don't have to worry about drama like in regular schools. You don't have to worry about getting bullied or someone trying fight you over something totally irrelevant.

In conclusion, I think that distance learning is the best idea for someone who is very homesick or doesn't know anything about other cities but there hometown. So if you are more of an antisocial person this would be a great thing for you to do because you dont have to interact with people or really talk to them at all.
