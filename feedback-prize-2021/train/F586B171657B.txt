The thing they saw is just a natural landform. There is no evidence that someone could have made it. Its just the was people look at it making them think that its a face. Things occur and just move things and make them look different. they may also made different shapes and objects. there is no evidence that aliens could of done it.

My opinion is that the way things move things could have crashed into it and made it look like a face. Its just something natural that happened. They don't have enough evidence to show what caused the face to form. Many things could have happened for the face to form but it doesn't mean that aliens or ancient things could of done this.

NASA has been putting a lot of money into this to see what caused this thing to form. They think there is life on that planet and that is what caused it to form and something made that thing that looks like a face. They saw that there wasn't any alien movement that it ws just a natural land form and thats what is. No aliens could have done this face. The thing that they thought was a face was just a mesa.

All of this was just that they thought aliens had done the face. but then they discovered that there was no alien movement and figured out that it was just a mesa. they were done with their research because they had nothing else to do with the mesa that they thought something had formed it.
