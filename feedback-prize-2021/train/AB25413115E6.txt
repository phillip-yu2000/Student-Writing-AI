Driverless cars are not a good idea. The cars are too risky for us to be depending on. Relying on a computer that could easily mess up/lag out causing someone or something to get hurt does not sound like the best idea. The driverless cars are not always computer dependant, sometimes when there are bad traffic conditions the cars will have the driver take control of the wheel. The cars are not very cheap either, costing more than the average car because of the driverless cars extra "perks," such as GPS, rearview camera, radar sensors, roof sensor, spinner sensor that creates a 3-D model of the cars surroundings.

In order to make these a possibility they have to convince the government to change the laws about driverless vehicles. In most states the vehicles are illegal and cannot be driven on roads because of fatality issues. They have to change the laws because if there is an accident, who gets the blame for the accident, the manufacturer or the person behind the wheel? This conflict is why most states have the law to protect their citizens from the hassle of deciding who to blame.

When the driverless car is in motion, it has many sensors to make sure that the car can drive safely to its destination. The car may also not be able to see a deer jumping out, or a kid running across the road quickly. The sensors woudn't be able to know when a car is quickly whipping around a corner where the computer can not see. The car would be unaware of any unexpected interactions and thats not safe for us to have on our roads.

Driverless cars are not a good idea because they're not controlled by humans, and the computers arent capable of avoiding wrecks, stopping for a car that ran a red light, a deer running out into the road, etc. We should not allow these cars to be sold, they're just too dangerous. We can not have accidents, and not know who to blame.
