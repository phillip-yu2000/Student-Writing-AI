All students should at least particpate in one extracurricular activity. All students should becuase they will be healthier, students will learn how to manage time, and students will learn new things and get to meet new people.

First reason why, is to be healthier. Activities like sports and workouts will get the student exercise wich everybody needs. It is important to stay in good shape becuase you will be healthier and will catch less diseases.

My second reason why is to learn how to manage time. Once students learn how to manage time there will be less kids coming to class late. Also its a very good and improtant skill to have when you grow up.

My third and final reason why all students should at least participae in one extracurricullar activity is to learn new things. Learning new stuff is fun and you might enjoy something you learn.
