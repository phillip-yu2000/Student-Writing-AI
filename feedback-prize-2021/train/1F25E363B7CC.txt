Dear Principal ,

I strongly believe that cell phones should be permitted at school . We should be aloud to use them during lunch periods and other free times we have as long as they are off during the class period. This is why i believe cell phones should be allowed at school.

Lots of students need their cell phones during the school day. For example, there might be an emergency going on and the student needs to call a parent. If cell phones were not permitted they might not be able to contact their parent and they could be in a lot of trouble. Also by having a cell phone with them it would be much easier to step outside of the classroom to contact someone instead of having to use the office phone or the teachers phone. Cell phones are great to have at school because lots of students at school need them through out the school day and if they didn't have them it might make their day a lot more complicated and stressful. Although you may think that if phones are allowed at school, students might be texting during class, you can make sure that all phones are off during the class period and may be turned on when the class period is over. If a student is caught disobeying the rules their phone should be taken away and given back at the end of the day.

In conclusion, please read this carefully and put in lots of thought to my ideas that we should be aloud to have our cell phones at school as long as there are rules to go along with that policy. Are students here at school are very responsible and I know that if we have this rule it can make our day here at school better for everyone!
