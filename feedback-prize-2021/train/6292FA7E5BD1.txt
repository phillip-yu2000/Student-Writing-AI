Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I believe that is a good option, and students would benefit being able to attend classes from home .Many teenager can have good benefits from taking classes from home. Today many students can not assist to the school because the transportation,or they have appointment that they have to assist.

First, I think that is good option for students to attend classes from home, because some students do not have transportation .For example, i have a friend that she can not study because her way to the school is very long and she do not have transportation and she do not have someone who came take her to the school because her family do not have a car .If she could have the opportunity to have class from home will be a good benefit for her,because she would like to finish her high school.

Also, many student miss classes because they have to work ,or they have appointments and they can not assist to their classes. When students miss classes ,they will be affected latter for their test or quiz .For example, last week i did not went to the school because i have a doctor appointment ,and when i went the next day i was affected because i took a quiz and i did not recover the class that i missed .But if students could take classes online the day that they can not assist to the school will be good because they will be not affected because they will have the opportunity to recover the class.

In conclusion, offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home online or video conference is a good option,because it will give a lot of benefits to many students who can no attend schools. It will be more easy to students who can not assist to their classes and they will no be affected on their grades,because students who miss one day can be affected a lot on their grades.
