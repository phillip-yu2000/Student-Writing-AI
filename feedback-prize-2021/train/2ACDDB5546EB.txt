Do you know what a Seagoing Cowboy is? They are more important than a regular cowboy. They are people who go out to sea after a war or something, and take care of animals that were shipped overseas. Doing this is a amazing experience and can change your life.

You might think that it is stupid, but I bet you do not think the military is stupid and that is who you are working for. It might not be out there battiling, but you are saving animals lives and providing food, clothing, transportation etc. When you bring them back to the people. Not only are you helping people you get to see amazing views. Plus there is more than one job on the ship that you can do.

While I was on the ship it was a huge adventure. Every now and then we get to go on tours and explore the world. When we were on the ship and there were not any animals aboard we played games, and just had fun while going to the next stop. We played games where we would have kept the animals. This is a serious matter, but you can also have fun and be responsible. When you are on the ship you have to be careful and responsible, You can have fun every now and then, but you cannot be playing all the time.

This was much more than adventure. I really got to see the world and the people there that had many needs. What the world really was that I had not payed much attention to. This is a lot better then trying to have two part time jobs. I am serving my country, and if you want to but do not want to fight I would say you should do this.

It is a once in a life time event. Coming from a small town and doing this. You can do it to, and you should. All you have to do voulenteer and maybe when you are out there and apply for the military they will keep you out there. Serving your country. You will not believe how it will change your life and make you feel accomplished. Besides all the tours and the fun it really is amazing.
