you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program''. You should join the program because it is a wonderful opertunity to see some amazing sites, interact with a lot of animals, and have a lot of fun during free time.

One reason you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' is because all of the amazing sites. When I was part of the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' I had the opertunity to see a lot of amazing sites. I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Another reason you should join the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program'' is because all of the great times we have during free time on the boat. There is a lot of free time on board exspecially during the return trips after the animals have been unloaded. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

You also get to interact with a lot of animals. While you are sailing It takes about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Caring for the animals during the crossings keeps you busy. They have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls have to be cleaned. Although it is a lot of work, when you are doing these things with the animals it forms a bond between you and the animal.

There are some reasons why you should join the ''Seagoing cowboys Program''. I hope you will take the oppertunity to atleast look into the ''Seagoing Cowboys Program''.
