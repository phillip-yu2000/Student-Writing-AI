The question is, for this advanced time period in the new discovery of technology being able to identify humans emotions, a good thing or bad? Well to simple start off my opinion to this idea, no; I don't agree with the new advancement of technology distinguishing humans emotions being good.

I don't agree with technology telling an individuals emotions, that being said; the reason why is because humans sound either already know or learn to identify how someone is feeling by the look on someones face theirself. Humans are capable of doing so. The technology, as explained in the story, looks at the forming of your lips, the squint near your eyes, your cheeks, and youre eyes themselves. All of which a human can do theirself.

The question in the article asks, "Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?" In my opinion yes it does, expression is the number one thing that deals with emotion. It's shown in the face, goes to every indent and wrinkle and mark in your face. It can be distinguished easily by the human eye evern if the emotion is trying to be hiden.

Although the counterargument is, the humans can't identify emotion from the face muscles, i could disagree with that aslo because the face msucles is what produces the expression, the muscles move your smile up, your cheeks more purky, to seem more happy and or sad. Muscles are the first step to identifying visually how a person is feeling which doesn't exactly need a technilogical discoverance.

With all that i have said, I simply think the world using technology on something so silly is a waste, humans should practice identifying those things personally and it is a good skill to learn in the real world. I disagree and I think the reasoning is valid. Technology shouldn't take basic emotion reading abilities.
