Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Many students have a grade C average, which is not that bad for an average. A grade C average is still a passing grade. To many people, sports and other activities is what helps students get them through troubles that they may have at home. Many times, sports raise people's self esteem and that could be how they are passing even though it's just on the edge of a passing grade. It is very important that everyone has something that they can rely on to make them happy and feel like they are important. Some students think about their sports and activities when they need something to give them the energy to stick up for what they believe in and realize how important it is to make the most out of the life that you have. That happened to me. I joined band this year and I now speak from my heart and I try my best to treat everyone with care. My first day of band everyone was so nice to me and they helped and made me feel like I've always been part of the band and they included me in everything. That activity has taught me to be a caring person and make the most of what I can and not act like someone I'm not. So, please consider allowing students with a C average to participate in sports and other activities. Sports and other activities are not just something people do for fun but, also to help them become a better person, themselves. Thank you so much!

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
