TEXTING AND DRIVING

"In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you", said by the mother of a texting while driving victim. The majority of people today use a smart phone on a daily basis. While cellphones have their pros and cons, there is one controversial issue that seems to triumph over the rest, and that is using a cell phone while driving. Operating a cell phone while driving can be extremely hazardous. By following the law and removing phones from behind the wheel, we can eliminate a monumental amount of deaths worldwide.

While some people really can multitask with a phone while operating a vehicle, everyone is not capable of this. Texting and driving is against the law for a reason. This law was put in place to protect us humans from traumatic car accidents.

Some may argue that it's okay to text & drive if you have a self driving car (Requires minimal driver's assistance) but numbers don't lie. According to the NHTSA, there was a Tesla fatality every 86 million miles in 2017, which is 40,000 deaths. Now imagine the amount of accidents in cars that don't drive themselves. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

Now all of these accidents can be eliminated if we as humans just put away their cell phones while behind the wheel. Whatever is being done on one's phone can't wait. A text message is not worth a life.
