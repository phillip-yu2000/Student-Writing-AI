Cell phones have become increasingly prevalent in the 21st century, made even more popular by the introduction of smartphones. Having access to the internet on demand has led to people being more informed but also made driving more dangerous. Many drivers nowadays drive and do many other things, usually on their smartphones. Texting and driving is almost always looked down upon but talking on the phone and driving is still seen as ok. Distracted driving kills over 1000 drivers a year and 600 pedestrians a year. These numbers could be cut down on if drivers were encouraged to just figuratively 'disconnect.'

Many smartphones apps have taken up the mantle to send messages telling whoever is messaging the driver that they are behind the wheel. This is a great solution to keeping drivers, both teenage and adult, eyes on the road instead of on their phone. These apps may just be the future for smartphones and driving. Another good solution for distracted driving is teenagers should be encouraged to take a step back from electronics every once in a while in order to do something else, like read a book, or spend time with family. This could encourage driving not plague by distractions.

Many teachers and employers can help in this as well. Distracted driving is everywhere. Educators could certainly spread awareness about the dangers of distracted driving ("Distracted Driving," NHTSA). The few and far between presentations about distracted driving a year help some but there could be some more awareness outside of school. Maybe advertisements and the sort. Advertising got adolescent smoking down from 9% to just 5% before the popularization of Juuls and Vapes. Why can't that be done again?

The final reason to cut back on cell phone use while driving is that people who text and drive are less likely to wear a seat belt ("Cell Phone Use While Driving" teendriverresource. org). This is another good reason why a bigger effort should be made to stop distracted driving.

Distracted driving kills more drivers than pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers. Oftentimes, the driver who was distracted dies in the accidents caused and the person who is crashed into usually lives because they are paying attention and wearing their seatbelt. This is why distracted driving should be cut down on. It kills over 1700 drivers a year ('Cell Phone Use While Driving').

Overall distracted driving is definitely an epidemic causing over 3000 deaths a year that can be avoided by just disconnected. By encouraging disconnection, people won't be as liable to pick their phone up in general, causing less distracted driving. Getting awareness out makes not just teenage drivers, but also young adults and older people aware of the dangers of driving.

Distracted drivers oftentimes don't wear seatbelts either causing even more undue deaths. With just a little more effort, distracted driving could be a thing of the past.
