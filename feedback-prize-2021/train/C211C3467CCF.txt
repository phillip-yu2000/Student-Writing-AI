Extracurricular Restrictions

I think it's fair to say that students should have at least a B average to participate sports and other extracurricular activities. This rule, even though it would at first limit the number of students allowed to participate, would eventually result in positive results such as motivating kids to raise their grades and teaching them to prioritize school before sports.

While some students may be upset that they cannot immediately join sports teams or clubs and choose to give up, I think even more would work to raise their grades so that they can participate in the activities. If everyone was allowed to join, regardless of grades, some students wouldn't care about how they were doing in class because either way they get to play their favorite sport. With the restrictions based on grades they would have to work harder to do the things they love. In this way the rule would promote hard work, determination, and more people pushing themselves to do their best.

In high school, and especially college, prioritizing is key. You have to juggle school work, sports, friends, family, and etcetera. If you don't learn early how to prioritize, you may end up feeling overwhelmed, with know idea how to do it all. By making students put their grades above everything else, it teaches them early how they can make it all merge together, so that they can do everything.

This rule isn't meant only to reward the students who make all A's and B's or punish the students who didn't do well in some of their classes by taking away their extracurriculars,

but also to motivate and encourage them to do better. And so while some people may argue against this rule, claiming it is unfair to require certain grades just to play a sport, act in a play, or participate in other activities, I think it would help people both in the short and long term, and should definitely be carried out in the school.
