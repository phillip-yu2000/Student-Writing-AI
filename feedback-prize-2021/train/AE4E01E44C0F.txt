I agree with doing at least one extracurricular activity. Do you like to have fun with others? If so, you should think about doing an extracurricular activity because you will have fun, it can teach you new things, and you can make new friends.

The first reason for doing an extracurricular activity is because you can have so much fun. For example, if you decide to do yearbook then you can go around your school to take pictures. You can also do volunteer work for your school games. Whenever you are out most of the time you are having fun. If you are with your friends then that's even more fun.

The second reason is that these activities can teach you new things. Say if you never played a sport before and you decide to join a team then this can teach you how to play. Learning new things can help you improve your curricular for school. You're also opening up a window that never been open before. Learning new things can also be fun, just give it a try.

The final reason is because you can make new friends. In my opinion, everybody needs friends or at least somebody to talk too. For example, say you chose to join a boy/girl scouts and nobody there knows each other that is a good opportunity to make new friends. It's not always easy making new friends, but in the end it's worth it.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities are important, because you will enjoy it, you can learn a lot from your activity, and you can also meet new people.
