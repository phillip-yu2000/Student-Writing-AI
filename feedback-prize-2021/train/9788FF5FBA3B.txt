Someone made a Facial Action Coding System, this technology is supposed to be able to know exactly how someone is feeling just by scanning that persons face. Is this technology valuable? Everybody in this world is different, not one person being the same as one another. That means that everybody feels different emotions about all different things. See where I'm going with this? It is pretty simple, how can something (A computer) Just know by reading your facial excpressions that you are angry, happy, sad,motivated, stressed, ext.? Every human experiences different emotions. Yes, some of them are the same emotions but if you put 100 people in the same room and told them something that was designed to make people angry would all 100 of those people feel the exact same way and have the same amount of anger towards it? I do not belive so. Some of the people would be mad, some would be happy, excited, and some simply might just not care. I'm highly pro-technology but, I do not believe that with the 7 Billion different people on this Earth, one piece of technology could be capable of acuratly telling us the exact emotions someone is feeling at that moment. Not just by scanning someone's facial expressions at least. So to end this pointless Istep rant, No do not believe that this technology is valuable.
