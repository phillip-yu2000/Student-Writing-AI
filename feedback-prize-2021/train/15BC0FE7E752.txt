The driverless cars are coming. This is the most greatest news ever. For technology and cars lovers and especially lazy people this is. But not just does people everyone generally. The world will love to nver have to drive a car again.

I am for the aspects of driveless cars. They are many reasons for my decision. In paragraph 1, cofounder of Google Sergey Brin states that he believe such cars would fundementally change the world. And Google has had cars that drive indepedantly since 2009. In paragraph 2, it says "Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash." Which means that the car actually works. I honestly doubt that a human can drive half a million miles without a single crash. But these developements for self driving cars was also back in the day. For example, in the late 1950s General Motors did radio signals. That read the posotive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. It also worked supringly well. Since the late 1950s to now we are still using sensors. Google and many other company's have modified and develloped automotive sensors. In the newer models of cars we have cameras that assist us. We have raidar signal and GPS receivers. These developments and new technology are catching up and will go further.

For now law is the major issue but soon they will be new laws added. These new laws will support this great new modern technology. In paragraph 10 it states "Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that problems ahead will be solved." and also the final sentence "But we ggrow closer to the destination everyday." And that is true, this is a great ideas and technology that we can't just let pass by us. Driverless cars are the futurtre and they are coming.
