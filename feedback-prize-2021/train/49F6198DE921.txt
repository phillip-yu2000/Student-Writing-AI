When seeking multiple opinions people are giving you constructive curtism, even tho it might hurt you it will build you up to become something better then you already are, and more informed in what they think. When you tell someone your opinion, then they comment it helps you speak more informative. You need to tell your opinion to someone that you trust so they give you good feedback. When telling someone your opinion it is important that you listen, cause they might change you mind.

Lets say you are running in the prisdentail election like Joe Biden and the people do not know were he stands in his views why vote for him, but when you know some of his opinions then that gives you a good reason to vote for him. When someone knows your opinion they might view it as the same thing that you do, so that can be a good convocation starter. It is good t know were someone stands cause they might view as the same but add on to it, so next time you will be more informed.

Just know the next time you go to start a convocation that they know your opinion. I can't stress that enough. So the next time you start a convocation let them know were you stand. When you let someone go into there opinion it is good to know were theyy stand.
