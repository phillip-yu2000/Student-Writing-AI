Dear Principle,

I think that all students should be required to perform community service. Some example or reasons that I think that students should be required to perform community service is that helping the world using community service is great. This will help the environment and help the world. This is why I think that this will help the environment and the world. This is because this will help the world not be a nasty world. This will also help clean up litters and help recycle to reduce killing animals, and polluting the world. Another reason why is that this will help what you can do when you have nothing else to do. This will be great if everyone can help each other to make the world a better place. My last reason why is that doing this can also reduce people from littering and other things because they will see how bad it will be if we didn't do this community service. People will also see us as hero's because we will be able to save the environment. This is why i think that all students who wants to take charge of making the world a better place, should be part of a community service and why we should require a community service.
