In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" the author makes a point about this facial Action Coding System (FACS) and how it is useful in the classroom. In this essay, I will explain how this new software is useful. And how useful it would be in the classroom.

One example of this technology being used in a classroom is, "A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."

This gives a real life example on how it could be used in a classroom.

The author explains that we already use this in the classroom everyday. This example is, "For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried, etc." This tells us that we use this everyday and we dont even know we use it. So we already use it in the classroom.

Another fine example is, "The facial expressions for each smotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression." This tells us that there are too many emotions to count and that it would be useful to teachers to be able to tell what the students are feeling.

Throughout this essay, I have described how the author tells us that using this technology would be useful. I fully belive that this would make the world a better place. We would be able to use it so we wouldn't hurt anyones feelings.
