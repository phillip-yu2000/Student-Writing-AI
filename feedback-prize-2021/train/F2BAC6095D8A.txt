I belive that students would work more effectivelly online rather, then sitting in a class room all day and not engaring in there learning rather then talking to there friends and being sociable.

When working online the student and teacher has obligations that he or she sould complete foor example a student that has a project due on wednesday and will do it ,on time and correct rather then the student, that goes to school and has the same project due on the same day there will be, more higher chances that the student working online will have it done first becuase the student has less time, to socalize with friends and has more time to stay foused on he's or her work .

Many kids have this advantage and it is a good one becuase they learn so much though out a online school rather then a public school ; becuase the class it more advanced and has for advantages for example the student ;online is taking pre calculas the student can easely tell the teacher what proble he or she is stuck on and the teacher can go over it explaning it in more it also help the student to be more engaging in there learning ; turo details rather then asking the teacher after class and not giving you a straight foward awnser .

Many student's taking classes online have the capibilidy and asset of graduating much earlyer becuase there classed are more advanced and with more potential to succed in life becuase of the parnts and the dissition that they have enrolled there kid in to online school ,rather then regular school .

Many parents do benifit from this great advantage becuase the student can take a class knowing that the parent will give suport to the kid in his or her future carrer.Â
