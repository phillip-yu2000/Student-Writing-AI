Why should I join the Seagoing Cowboys program? Because you get to go many exciting places like europe,greece,china,venice italy. Also when the job is done if you want you can have fun like going on a gondola ride in venice italy and touring the excavated castle in crete and be amzed by the panama canal in china. You can do many interesting sightseeing things and go many interesting places.

How about on the ship what do we do when we get bored and have finished our work? You coould always while on the ship do many intersting things like baseball, vollyball,Table tennis tournaments,fencing. boxing,reading and whittling. What if I do not like any of those games? You could always hang out with the animals feed them or play with them if you want or if you want to be alone you could go in one of the empty rooms.

What if we dont have any free time? Well there one thing you could do to pass the time care for the animals they keep you busy because they have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats have to be pulled up from the lower tower and stalls have to be cleaned because when sailing it does take a long time to cross oceans it takes at least

2 weeks.

In conclusion you should join the Seagoing Cowboy program because there are so many interesting things that you can view with your own eyes that you could bring up later on or even write a story on later in life. You could have so much fun and if your just a small town boy then it would be an honor to tour the world and experience things on your own especially if you love animals.
