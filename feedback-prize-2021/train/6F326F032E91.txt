My name is Luke Bomberger I want you the reader to join the "Seagoing Cowboys." The reason I would like you to join is because you cant take care of animals while we are transporting them across the Atlantic Ocean.

Another reason I

want you to join the "Seagoing Cowboys" is because we transport food supplies,animals, and more. During the crossing I had to cre for the animals. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had be cleaned.

On my second trip I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour. The cowboys and I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.
