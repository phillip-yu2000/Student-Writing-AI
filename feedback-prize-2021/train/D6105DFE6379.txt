Dear Principal,

I have been informed that you will be changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I agree with this idea since it will motivate students, and raise the GPA.

Schools have pep rally, and parties to motivate students to perform better on assessments, but by changing school policy to a Grade B average then they will have a motive or objective to reach for the goal to do better. This is why you should raise the policy to have a B average.

By increasing the policy to have a B point average to participate in sports then student will be more progressive increasing the school GPA and overall goal for the school increasing the chance of being one of the highest school in the district.

Some people may say, that the school is expecting to much out of the students. Well they are wrong. To participate in sports is a privilege that should not be abused. Some of the best player took education more important than shooting a ball.

In conclusion, the idea of changing school policy is indeed a great one not only for the school but for the best for the students overall. Now take this information and use it to make your decision on if school policy should be changed.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
