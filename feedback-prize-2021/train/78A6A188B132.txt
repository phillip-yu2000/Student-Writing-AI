Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Cell phones are used every were. In school kids are there to learn so why should they be able to use there phones? When you tell kids that they can use there phones they use it all day. Kids will just get distracted. There grades will drop to an all time low. They will make the school look bad in academics.

Kids get distracted with everyday school materials what makes you think that with phones they wont just blow off there work to text. Kids would ignore the teachers and just use there phones to listen to music. Kids will use there phones just to free load, play around, and to listen to music. Not ones have i ever seen kids use there phones for work.

Kids grades are bad enough with out phones. There are times were you have good kids and they do there work. But that doesn't mean they wont just for get about grades because of there phones. I did research and statistics say that a school who let kids use there phones in school dropped 80% academically.

If a school has the best sport team or the nicest and cleanest hall ways does that mean anything. NO what matters are grades. Kids will get on there phones and do everything but there work. If the school shows a big drop in grades why would they get money? Without money they will have to fire people.

So i recommend you to reconsider your decision on allowing kids to use there phones during school.

Love,
