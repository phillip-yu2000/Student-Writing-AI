I like this idea a lot. It would be a good way for students to make new friends and find an activity that they enjoy. Some students might not like it because it would take time away from doing other things. Even though kids should already be doing activities or sports. A lot of kids will just sit around and watch Netflix after school. This will give them a chance to find something they like to do that is more active. I think that parents would be happy that there child is getting more involved and having fun.

Some people struggle to pay for things like this. So if anyone could give a little extra money for those kids then the teams would be bigger and better. The principle could even make the activities cost little to nothing so that every student could be doing something. If a student isn't participating in a sport then the cost might go up or down, it depends on what they decide.

This could help them in the future like when college's start looking for students. They want students who get involved with things at school and who try there best. So if the students don't participate in anything then there is a slimmer chance of getting into a good school. Once you graduate and start looking for college's it would be harder to find one if your don't participate in activities.
