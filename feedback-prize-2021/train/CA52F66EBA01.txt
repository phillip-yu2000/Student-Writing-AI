Recently we have discovered a new landform on Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture of a martian mesa, these are very common. These martian mesas are similar to the ones on Earth. They are very common in Cydonia, a region on Mars. Many conspiracy therorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is not true.

The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large mesa-like landform with the face an Egyptian god on it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any other one. The reason it looks like a face is because shadows were being cast onto it to make it appear like it had eyes, a mouth and a nose.

In 1998, a camera captured another picture of the formation. It was a little cloudy on the day they took the picture, so we went again to capture another picture. This time in April of 2001, we used a much better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was much more detailed and clear. Once we zoomed in it looked like any other landform we might find. In paragraph 11 Garvin states, ¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see them!¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is no alien activity near this landoform.

In conclusion, it is clear that the ¨Face on Mars¨ wasn´t created by aliens. We took a much more defined picture and found nothing. Not to metion the fact that there is no water on Mars, so it can´t support life. Very very few of the scientists beleive that this was created by aliens. Everything can be explained by science in this picture.
