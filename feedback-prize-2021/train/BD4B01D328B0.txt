To our principal,

I have heard about the newly suggested school policy. To be quite honest, I am completely against it. Just take a look at the main grade average. Many of the students in this school have a grade C average, and you want to say that they can't compete in sports unless they can bump their average up by at least one grade level? I understand that you want all of the students in this school to put their best foot forward and try for the best, but this isn't the way to make kids do that. There should be reward for making their grade average go up like that without a penalty to those who are having a hard time doing so. Maybe a pizza and ice cream party to those who can bump up their grade average. After all, a lot of kids depend on sports to have time to relax. Taking sports away from those kids would just get them even more stressed out and would likely make them do worse in school, rather than better. Whatever your choices are, please promise me that you will at least consider this.

Thank you and have a good day,

an anonymous student at your school.
