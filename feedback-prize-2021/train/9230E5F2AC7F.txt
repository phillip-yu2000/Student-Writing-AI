Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that cell phones should be completely banned from school grounds for good.

All they do is cause people to not pay attention or possibly even start personal problems that could involve violence.

Cell phones do you no good at school and there is no point in having them.

If you want to talk to your friend walk over to them and have a conversation with them.

If i was the principle I would ban cell phone use and take every phone that I saw no matter who the kid was.

I don't have a phone and I am getting along just fine without one.

I believe that if I can get along without a phone at home my peers can go without there phone for eight hours a day.

Most teenagers may be attached to there cell phones but I think they can do without them.

It may even help them to learn other things instead of which button to click on their cell phone.

The only reason I can think of that cell phones could be used for is to distract students from paying attention during class.

In the long run using your phone in class instead of paying attention could come back and haunt you.

There not going to do any student any good while at school.

There a total waste of time and money.

Teens could be doing other things with their free time at school.

Like: doing homework, reading a book, or even just talking to their friends.

So that is my point of view in the policy of cell phones.

I hope you take this letter into consideration and ban cell phones from the school for good.
