I think that we should change it to populure vote, as in like who ever gets the most votes, but on a national scale, not on a state scale.  why? well I realy would have to agree that an even number could cause a tie. Even if the tie was settled by the congress and senate there could be major problems. like for example lets just say that the last election was a tie, the out come of the tie would be Romney as president ( whitch would be good) and Joe Biden as vice president ( realy bad). and the reason this could be very bad, because of the fact that the two of them have very diferent opinions the two of them would probably be so busy arguing that they wouldn't get anything done, plus Joe would constantly be trying to get Romney impeached.

My second reason is becuse yes one of the guys who puts in our votes could put it in incorectly because of the fact that somone could simply bribe him or her to do so.  The scary thought is that if one person does it and gets away with it then every one with lots of money will try, just like someone could try and bribe me to tell them what this test is on ( i wouldn't say unless it was well over $200 but no one I know has that much they would want to spend on a test so nobody has tried to bribe me).

So now my third reason is it would be prety cool to know that the next president could be decided by a single vote but that is even more unlikely than a tie with our current system. But it would be more likely that it could come down to a more probable minimum of around a milion.

Now that I have covered my three reasons I hope you have gained a more valuable view of our presidential election system and that will consider more carefully on what you will choose.
