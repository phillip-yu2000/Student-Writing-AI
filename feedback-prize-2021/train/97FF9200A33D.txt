Have you ever wondered why somebody might ask you for directions and then walk away and ask somebody else? If you have then don't take offense to it. They only want to make sure they get the right answer. People ask more than one person because someone might not know the answer, one answer might be false, and someone may lie.

First, the person might not know the answer. If a traveler asks you for directions to the interstate and you don't know how to get there, then he or she has to go to another person and ask them. The person that the traveler goes to next for directions after you might not know so the traveler just keeps going. If you don't know the answer tell the traveler that you don't know so they don't get mad at you for giving the wrong information. Therefore, tell the traveler that you don't know the answer.

Secondly, somebody's statement might be false. If somebody's statement is false then you have to ask another person. If somebody says something false and you believe them then you might regret not asking another person. Don't believe anybody unless you have confirmed it with multiple people you trust. Therefore, always see if the person's statement is true or false.

Finally, somebody you ask might lie to you. Even though somebody might really help you and you don't listen to them, still check around. If somebody does lie to you then you can figure it out by asking around. If you do ask multiple people then it doesn't matter if one of them lied. Therefore, make sure nobody is lying to you.

In conclusion, if you or your friend is asking somebody about directions or anything else make sure you ask a couple of people. Remember these things, someone might not know the answer, one answer might be false, and someone mayÂ lie. If you need to check and make sure that the statements are true before asking another person the same question. Make sure that you ask advice or directions from people you trust and ask more than one person.
