Dear Principal,

I do not think that we should be required to do community service because we have to do other things that we are involved in. Some examples are sports, music, and helping our neighborhood out. We already have so much stuff taking up our time that it is almost impossible. Plus, we want our weekends to ourselves so we can relax from the past week. We should not require community service to be done on weekends because we want to hang out with our friends. Community service could be offered to other people if our schedules are free for a few days. Other than that, I don't think that kids would want or be able to do it.

Plus, some of us go on trips and might not be able to do the community service all the time. Some of the community service doesn't sound exciting either, so I doubt that kids would want to do it if it sounded weird. Many kids don't even end up doing community service either and probably still wouldn't if you made it a requirement, which would end up being a waste of time and money. Few kids do the community service but don't end up doing much of it. Still, you are entitled to your own opinion and have the choice to make community service a requirement. Not many kids are willing to clean up any litter. The parents usually end up forcing their kids to do the community service which is why most kids don't seem happy while doing it.

I just hope that your seeing my point of this letter and take my thoughts into consideration. These are true facts that I am telling you and hope that they can be helped.

Sincerely,
