Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand your concern for our grades, as standardized testing is coming up, but surely you think that stepping up our game academically will just put more pressure on our players? Play-offs are popping up, and our team is being worked hard to ensure that they make it to the championship bracket. A big band concert is also coming, and we need everyone on the team and in the band.

I'm not saying we don't need this new grading system. Many people on our team are putting off their assignments to do unrelated things (like watching TV). Can we put this into effect after play-offs? Surely our band will agree with this, as they have a concert in a few days.

Playing basketball gets adrenaline pumping through the system, clearing the mind and working faster. While this is mainly used for tactics in the game, a little adrenaline keeps the mind focused after the game. Considering most kids do their homework and study after everything else is finished, we could improve our homework and test grades using this adrenaline residue.

We also have to take into account the mood of the student body. If the kid doesn't want to do their homework, then they won't do their homework. If there is general carelessness, apathy, and depression among students, then it might be time to get some results out of other extracurricular programs. Maybe we should host a bake sale, everyone loves cookies.

I hope you take my letter into consideration, as I am eagerly cheering on our Panthers as we win games, listen with awe when the choir sings, and applaud with everyone else after the band's performance.

Signed, STUDENT_NAME
