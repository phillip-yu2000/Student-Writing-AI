What do i thank about students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I'm a student as well. By me being a student, I wouldnt noot want to have online class. There are a fow reasons, why I feel that this shouldn't be, and a fow reasons why it should be.

These are the reasons, why I wouldn't want to have online class. Well the first reason would be that everyone do not have Wifi at home to do the work. The seceand reason would be that some students would need more help with the work then others. The other reason would be that not every student have someone what home to keep the student on top of there work or to help then. So i thank it's best for students should go to school, and not do class online. Do to these reasons.

Now these are the reasons, why I thank students should have the online class. Well my first reason, would be that some young adoults have a lot on there plate, where they would have time to come dorning school hours. The seceand reason would be that some young adudlts have to be at home, do to buliling, and other soluton prombles. Where there are student thst would like to be away from everyone eles, because of thoes other students. The other reason would be the to help the student the learn better by having that online surves.

Also these are from a student that have a lot of asosheats that need that exchea help with work. Myself need some exchea sometime in some class, and Iknow there is so may young adults that have a lot to do when they get home. Also what about the studebts that want to do sports. Where would they go to have pratice and have games. How would they get to the pricties and games, if there parent or goureden cant bring them. When they are at work, or taking care of there other childern.Â
