When people ask for help it would be better to ask more then one person so you can have more then one opinion. That way if the two or more people give you the same response it would most likely mean they are giving you more relieabul information. You also need to be careful who you ask, because just asking two or more people you don't know will probably not be a good option to do, because some people might give you false information on perpeas just because they had a terribly day. when people are addicted to drugs they ask more then one person for advice so they can see how they quit, and try the same method as the first person they asked and mix it with the seconded person method. When people want to start a fast food place they take people advice and then that is the way the inside look and how the dress and the menu. Taking more then one person advice is better then taking one person advice because it give you different option what to do in life and you can mix one person advice with somebody alse advice and then give that advice to sombody alse.
