I think the driverless car is a bad idea, because if and when someone is injured in a car wreck who is to blame. you can make a law about that, but its just gonna turn into an arguement with everyone who is paying attention to it. If a driver is injured in a car wreck with the dreiverless car the person to blame is the manufacture. the manufacture put this car into the world and said it was safe and the "most of the time" nothing will happen. If the driverless car comes out into the world, its gonna be ran off some sort of technology back at the manufacture, if so its gonaa be hackable by anyone who is smart enough to do so, or if someone who works for the manufacture wanted to they could hack it them selves and get a lot of people hurt just by turning it off or turn the direction its going a little bit. they may even be a little mishap in the driverless car and the manufacture just skip it and move on later that mishap may get a bunch of people killed or injured.
