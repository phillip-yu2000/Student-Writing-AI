Dear principal,

I have realized that you are thinking that students are required to do community service.

What i think you should do is make them do community service. It be a great learning experience. Kids like myself would learn true values of being helpful and also learn respect.

They might not like it at first, but eventually through time they will become better students.

Kids grades might improve by learning true values of respect and education. Every day most kids in about 53.7% don't have good grades and this could make that percentage go down. Just think better grades also means more money for the school.

I think that you should have kids do community service. i know it makes me feel good inside the work itself seeing people smile is the greatest reward of all. The kids hopefully will like that just as much as me. That in itself is why the kids should do community service. I know you will make the right decision, good luck and be grateful.

from,
