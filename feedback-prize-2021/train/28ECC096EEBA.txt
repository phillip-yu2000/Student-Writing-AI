Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do not think that community service should be required in school. Even though it is a great way to meet new people and is a very honourable action, some students just do not have the time to do things like that.

We as students are given many projects and a plethora of homework, not to mention studying for tests, to add community service as a requirement would nearly be a crime. Personally I think that community service is a great thing to do, but as a hobby not a requirement. If you where to add community service as a requirement I assure you that a lot of grade A students will be retained for not participating. I alone sometimes feel overwhelmed by the various work assignments that I receive at school, and I usually get an A or a B, but if I had to work community service as well i would become too over worked and start on a steep downward slope in my grades.

If you made community service as a way to get high school credits however, I think that everyone will be very happy. You will get to brag to the school board that your students participate in community service, and the over worked students will be able to do community service when their schedule clears up.

You have now read my argument and resolution, so the final decision is up to you, and I hope that you take what I have written into consideration. Goodbye.
