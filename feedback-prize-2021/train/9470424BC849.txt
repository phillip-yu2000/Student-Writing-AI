I PROPER_NAME do not agree with this subject. I beleave that no one should beable to make there country or state non driving this are no advantiges of not really having then yes you get exercise and yes less trafic but then guess what then people will be late to jobs and will be cold in whinter then guess what you all state or country will go to compleate crap all because you want to be a healty apple in the world. I had got my licence when i was 16 years old on my birthday and i was happy i had bought my own car and it was five speed and i tolk my test and guess what i passed with a 100 on it now if you want to make road more safer re test these old people on the road like relly some of then cant even see over wheel or they dont know what no you turn mean they allways drive to slow and cause acident so now what do you have to say about that.

yes they kids now aday dont even get there perment because the testr book they give you is no where near the questions they ask you and dont for get about you oldy have 20 sec to anser it what the hell is the rush for so you can fail then if they pass they pass if they fail they fail so leave us kids a lone pick on the old people they get so old and drive they sneze and have heart atacts every day and kill people so that is what i think of this prompt.
