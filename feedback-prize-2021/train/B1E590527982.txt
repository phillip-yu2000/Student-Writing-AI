Cell Phones at school?

I think policy one is better because kids actually get to have their phones with them. if they where to do policy two most kids would be ticked off because they don't get their phones at school at all and if they needed to call someone after school they wouldn't be able to because their would be no phones at school and would have to do something. kids would understand that they could use them at lunch and other times out of class more than just keep them at home. I would be mad if i had to keep my phone at home and i missed the bus and didn't have a way to call my parents. phones are an important part of allot of peoples life's. But most kids would just brake the rule if policy two was in place and would get in trouble if the teacher say the phone at lunch or something. that's a way why policy one should be in place.

Teachers may like policy two better because of not having to worry about having a phone in class but i think the kids would just get mad and not do their work or something like that and basically go on strike against the school or teachers. kids would hate it if their was absolutely no phones. The kids would go crazy if they where not aloud to bring phones to school. kids could at least bring their phones to school and keep it off during class and if not in class that's when they can use their cell phones so yeah kids would be happy to at least have their phones at school. that's why policy one, is a good policy.
