I think the author does not support his reason very good because he states a lot of reasons why its bad. A couple reasons why it is a bad for example in paragraph three he says the average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. For the temperature being so high and the pressure being so high all we can do is be in a vehicle 30 miles up from Venus talking pictures and still the temperature from that far up would be 170 degrees farhrenheit and we could take rock samples but it would be very hard because of how hot it is. The only reason he says why its good is in paraghraph eight and he says we should explore Venus is because of human curiosity. In conclusion the author does not support the exploration of Venus very goof because he states to many facts of why its bad and to little of facts why it would be good.
