I think policy one is the best because it's cool to have students in teachers bring their cell phones to school. One reason is what if their is an emergency and we need to call home.

Teachers can talk in class on the cell phone why can't we. I mean it can interrupt class but we can put it on viberrate. See what I mean I just heard a teachers phone go off.

We won't pay attention so cause of texting but that's why you turn it off during class time. And use them during free time, and they shouldn't take them when they go off in class.

And we also could use them during lunch periods.

In the video it shows students using their cell phones during class, at lunch, in the library,

and in the hall ways. That's what i am talking about. But

I go against policy two because what if we miss the bus or something and we can't call parents to come pick us up.

Another reason is that's no fun, and everybody has cell phones these days. Just remember i am right you will see.
