your principle is making everyone join a school related club/sport. But your a really shy person, so you asked if you had to join. your principle said "you will have to choose at least one activity". Lets make a character named Generic_Name, he loves to play sports and play the guitar so he is glad that they made this rule. But Generic_Name on the other hand, doesn't play an instrument or play sports, she likes to read and she is a really good artist. so she tries to find a club that has to do with learning or something to do with art.

initially Generic_Name and his friend group all went to the baseball club and met the couch and instantly started practicing. Generic_Name couldn't find any of her interest in that area. so she goes to the library and finds that there are all these book clubs. she got super excited. she went up to one of the tables and asked what kind of books. a girl she new from math class said "all the books here are non fiction". Generic_Name asked "do you know where i could find the graphic novel area". she pointed in the back corner, where the lights are dim and the walls are all starched up. Generic_Name said "thank you", she went to the back corner. she said nervously "hello is anyone back here", suddenly a guy dressed like a zombie jumps out and scares Generic_Name. she screams and runs away. the zombie guy turned around and said to his friend excitedly "man that was the closes i have ever been to a girl, HIGH FIVE".

Generic_Name started thinking what other things she's good at. she thought about it and started walking towards the art room. she walks in and the Mr Generic_Name the art teacher pops out and says "welcome to the art room how may i help you". Generic_Name asked "what kind of art clubs are in here". Mr Generic_Name said " well there's painting club where you paint anything that comes to mind" Generic_Name shook her head no and asked "is there other types of clubs". Mr Generic_Name said "there's water coloring club, computer arts, drawing club, and there's animation club". Generic_Name asked "may you lead me to the drawing table. Mr Generic_Name says "follow me".

she looks at the amount of people around the drawing table. she starts to get nervous. Generic_Name starts thinking of her social anxiety and her eyes start to twitch and she starts messing with her hair. she walks up to the table and puts her name down as Generic_Name. Mr Generic_Name says "great choice your going to love this club". she says thank you as he walks away.

the next day, Generic_Name walks into the art classroom finding that they are drawing animals. she starts looking around to see if she knows anyone. she doesn't recognize anyone so she goes into the back corner and starts to draw a really cool looking dragon. A person named Generic_Name comes up to her and says " Hi, my name is Generic_Name". she looks up and says "Hi, my name is Generic_Name". Generic_Name asked about what she is drawing, Generic_Name says "I'm drawing a alligator, what about you" Generic_Name replies and says "a dragon". Generic_Name nods and asked "what's are you going to name the drawing"? Generic_Name shrugs and replies "I don't know what about you, what are you going to name your drawing" Generic_Name says "that question i can not answer at the moment". Generic_Name turns around and starts moving back to her desk. Generic_Name said "Generic_Name would you like to come over to my house after school tomorrow". Generic_Name turns around and says "yeah that would be nice".

as the school day goes on, Generic_Name can't wait to have a friend over at her house. Generic_Name heard the bell and starts racing to her car. she starts the car and starts going home. a couple minutes later Generic_Name shows up to her house. Generic_Name knocks and Generic_Name invites her in. Generic_Name and Generic_Name walk up stairs to Generic_Name's room. And Generic_Name pulls out paper and pencils for them to start drawing. Generic_Name grabs the pencil and paper and starts to draw a platypus. Generic_Name looks up and says "what are you going to draw and Generic_Name says a dragon".

Generic_Name has really bad social anxeity. she would start to figit and her eyes would start to twitch a little. but this is a great example of how to get over your own anxeity and take a step forward in life, not be all by youself your whole life. most likely after this she would be able to make new friends and go out to restruants, amusment parks, and bowling alleys. Generic_Name joining the drawing club was one of the best things that happened to her. and that is why I agree with what her princible has done to his school.
