Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I, a student of your school SCHOOL_NAME, advise you enforce policy 1. I believe this because lunch is supposed to be a free time where students can take a break from school work in order to be able to work for the rest of the day. Though sneaking cell phones in classrooms are an issue in this option. However, I have made a plan to prevent this.

Teachers can make students turn on alarms on their cell phones throughout the day so teachers can detect cell phones being on. You would also have to make them turn their cell phones to the maximum volume so teachers can hear if the students are turning them down. There is an issue of students turning off their cell phone alarms during free times, but teachers can check their cell phones after free times.

There is also another problem with students turning off the alarms during class, though there is a solution to that also. Teachers can patrol the classroom while teaching orally. They can also get a chalkboard with wheels and patrol while teaching with a chalkboard. Teachers will be able to see their cell phones being used.

That is why I believe you should enforce policy 2 instead of policy 1. All problems that are very effective can be eliminated with the ideas I have. The students will be able to do work and have a effective break.
