Some students like to perform charity services, or community service. This demonstrates an act of kindness toward your community. It shows that you want to help people and your community get better, or cleaner. But some people do not really want to do community service because it takes away to much time from their day or the simply are not willing do this service. Therefore, I do not believe that a principal should force middle school kids to do this because of the reasons stated below.

Yes community service is a good thing, but what if you do not have time for it. I, for example, am involved in many sports that take up a lot of my time. There is just no room in my busy schedule to fit in community service. This might be the same for other kids my age. They might not want to do community service but it really helps our environment and people who need it. But it would still be nice to complete some hours before high school.

Most kids would play on their Ipod, or go to the mall, or even go to the movies. Yet, some children who have nothing better to do might volunteer their time and energy into their hometown, or community in which they live in. If they do not have anything going on that weekend they might finish some house work or go pick up litter on the beach or around their neighborhood. These people are very nice and deserve a pat on the back. Although, people like this do not come around very often.

I still do not believe in making middle school kids do community service. High school might be a good age to start, but definitely not middle school. There are still many, many reasons why people should do community service but I am not one of those guys who would do it voluntarily. And i know for a fact that my friends do not want to do it either. Maybe later, but definitely not now.
