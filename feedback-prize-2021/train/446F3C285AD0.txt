I can assure you that the Face on Mars is just a natual landform, like the ones here on Earth. "In 2001, on April 8, MGS captured a photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution." "Using more pixels than the best 1976 Viking photo." "As a result, the image was much more clear." "So you could discern things that were on the ground." "If there were structures on the ground, you could see what they were."

"What the photo really showed was the equivalent of a butte or mesa." "Landforms in which are common around the American West." "It is also like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." "A lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa." "In which is the same height as the Face on Mars."

Another reason is that, "on April 5, 1998, MOC team took a picture ten times sharper than th original Viking photos." "Thousands of people were waiting when the image appeared on a JPL web site." "It revealed a natural landorm." "People were disappointed to see this." "Meaning no alien monument was found."

Now I hope I have explained this clear enough for you to understand. To show you how the Face on Mars isn't really a face at all. And that it wasn't built by aliens. But is in fact a natural landform. Just like the ones here on Earth.
