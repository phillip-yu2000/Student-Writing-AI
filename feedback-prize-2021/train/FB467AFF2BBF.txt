Do you think there is a face on Mars? This theory has been questioned for a long time. We have found odd things throughout the years of human existance and speculations towards this face has been studied.

The face on Mars is not actually a face. It is probably holes in the rock of the ground just shaped perfectly like a face underground. Even if there was a body burried under there you wouldnt be able to see the face if you dont see the body.

Why hasnt NASA unburried this object or crater to see if it actually is a body. This face is only a theory towards Mars having an ancient civilazation. The object there isnt a face, it is only a natural landform.

Have you heard of electromagnetic force fields? If not, they are locations on earth in which it radiates high frequencies and no animaml can live on this land. Human could for awhile but it might make you go insane. Do you think these are just alien sites that we cant handle? Most likely not, it is natural within earth. Our planets has its own different things throughout it and Mars could just have craters everywhere. This one just happens to be captured and looked like a face.

Do not believe everything you hear or see because our mind can trick us. Natural landforms come in all different shapes and sizes. Next time you think there is a face in the ground remember that its not actually a face.
