Driveless cars sound really cool and up to date to many people. People would think they wouldnt have to pay any attention to their surrondings, the road, or have any sense as to where they are going. These driving cars are developed to have vibrating drivers seats when the vehicle is in danger and the car has absolutley no control over itself no matter how dangerous the situation is. The driver himself would have to do everything he could to get the car in control and to avoid the incident as soon as possible. So why would even get a driveless car if you have to take control every once in a while? Driving cars sound pretty dangerous and could possibly put you in an accident.

When you hear about driveless cars, you'd really like to think you dont have to do much of anything since the car is in control itself and you have all this time to relax. Wrong. The driver DOES have to take immediate control when the car is in danger, (could be of backing into an object etc.), navigating through work zones, and having to work your way around accidents.

"The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph." Only 25 mph. How come these things can't handle being on the highway or interstate? The driverless car sounds usless and it's another excuss for people to be lazy. Actually, couldn't you lose braincells if not paying full attention to what you're doing in the car/on the road? Maybe not lose braincells but in a way this driverless car could possibly mess you up in a way mentally because in that moment you dont have a care in the world and thing you don't need to pay attention to what's going on around you inside the car. It could maybe make you lose hope for yourself because now you can depend on something else to do something for you even though you're still in the use of danger inside a driverless car. Manufacturers are wasting their time.
