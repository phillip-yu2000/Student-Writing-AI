I think that kids should have at least a C or up to participate in school sports because more kids have a C so that puts more people on teams and in activities. And more kids get exersize that way and they really want to do something they like and if they have a C they wont be able to do the sport or activities he/she wants to do . Like for instance a kid has a C and he/she is a really good at sports but not at school so well, then are school just lost a person that could have been a good football player or a good cheerleader or volleyball players they wont be able to play because they have a C so if the policy is every kid needs a B to play then we could lose a lot of good sports players so that's why i think the policy should be they have a C.
