In life, we all have to make decisions. Everyday choices, like deciding what shirt to wear or what to eat for lunch, generally do not have a huge impact or require much consideration. However, a time will come when you have to make a difficult decision that could affect many things in your life. In these situations, people tend to turn to their friends and family for advice. Before making the final decision, it is best to collect the opinions of multiple people. Seeking advice from more than one person will benefit you as everyone has different experiences and opinions, and you will learn the pros and cons of different views.

The first reason you should talk to different people before making an important decision is everybody has a different experiences an opinions. For example, if you are deciding where you want to go to collage and you ask your uncle, a James Madison University graduate, where he thinks you should go, he will most likely try to convince you that JMU is the best option. However, if you ask your aunt, a University of Virginia graduate, she will probably give reasons why you should attended UVA and not JMU.

It is important to talk to multiple people so you can better understand different perspectives and experiences.

The second reason getting advice from multiple people is helpful is you can understand both the pros and cons of your options. People are biased because of their experiences, and this can lead them to tell you the wonderful things about their opinions and the horrible things about otherÃÂ´s ideas. If you only ask one person for advice, you will only get half an opinion. This will leave you as misinformed as an inexperienced child. Collecting advice from many people allows you to hear positive and negative points about your choices.

All in all, seeking advice from multiple people can help you when making a challenging decision because you will receive opinions that allow you to view different experiences and you can see the pros and cons of your options. It will give you more knowledge about your decision and help you feel more comfortable with your final decision. If you are facing a challenging choice and turn to your loved ones for advice, be sure to ask a few of them!
