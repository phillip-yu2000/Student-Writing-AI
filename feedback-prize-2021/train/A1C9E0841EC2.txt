Venus is important for many different reasons. Not only is Venus Earth's "twin", it is also the closest planet to Earth in denisty and size. In the article the author belives that studying Venus despite the many dangers it brings is very much worth it. I will talk about why he is correct.

The author of this article suggets that studying Venus is worthy of our time because it could help us learn about it and it's past. Also the planet is the most geologically similar to Earth in our entire solar system. In paragraph 4 the author states, "Long ago, Venus was probably covered largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth". This quote shows that learning about Venus told us that in it's past it was capable of sustaining life. I belive also that the author is correct in saying that we should study it more because, if Earth every came to where it was not able to sustain life, we could look into moving to Venus because it was capable of sustaining life. Despite these dangers that he presented such as a very high tempature, exploring more into Venus is very important.

In conclusion, I believe the author was correct in saying that we should look more into Venus becasue we could learn about it past and it's capability of sustaining life in the future. That is why Venus is so important not just to the author but also to NASA.
