For me right after i got out of highschool i went to the ,Seagoing Cowboys progam. I got to do things like see the world,and learn how to be a good employee. I got to do things some people will get to do, that is why you should sign up too.

One amazing thing that i got to try while doing the program was i was able explore the world. I got to ship 335 horses and enough food to feed them to Greece. While in Greece igot to see Acropolis that was truly amazing for me.

Just imagine what it would be like for you. Other places i saw were, China,and Europe,They were also amazing.

Also While being on a ship i learned good work ethnics being there you had to work,so i cleaned stables and feed the animlas. It tought me skillls that i use in the real world.

hard work is a good skill since now people think they are intitled to stuff, and we aren't. we must work fo our own stuff and thats what theytought me. You could even make it a legacy you could do it aand then your son could do it and so on (etc).

One last thing don't you love america? by helping me help you are helping your people you are giving back to your country and that will sure make your mom proud ,( less dangerous and risky than the army).I take that back you not just helping america you helping earth. Your cleaning up the mess we as all humans started War we need to help clean it up now to prove to your family and our God that we are worhty of life on such wonnderful planet.

Now that you have heard from me will you reconsider your thinking. Try it out if you dont like don't do it. But you should always try everthing. So please come help in my program Seagoing Cowboys.
