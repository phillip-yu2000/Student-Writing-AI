In the article "Unmasking the Face on Mars" it talks about the face on Mars and how it was put there. Three ways scientists have concluded, is that there was once life on Mars and the face is from Aliens that once lived there. Others think it was hit by a huge rock and where it got hit it left an identation that just looks like a face. Or that the Face is just something that formed there naturally but to the human eye it looks like a face.

In my opionion I believe the face was put there by a rock or it just formed naturally and that there was no aliens on Mars. I say this because rock formations happen all the time along with rocks bumping into planets causing indentations on planets. Even most scientists believe it was not put there by an alien like in paragraph 6 of the article it says, "Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact." I also believe that the face was put there by either a rock or just formed there by itself because if it was put there by a alien how have we not ever seen any of the aliens there on Mars or around Mars not only recently but ever? Or how have we not found any other artifacts left behind by aliens?

So in conculsion all of the information I have read in this article show me that any of the theories could be true but I still believe that the Face is just an identation on Mars left from a rock collesion or just formed there naturally. Especially since we do not have any other artifacts of it being put there by a alien or another living thing.
