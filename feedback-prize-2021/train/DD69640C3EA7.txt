According to the article there has been a new technology invented called the Facial Action Coding System. The new technology was made to be able to reconzie a facial expression od how someone is feeling. My prompt is to explain weather this new piece of technology would be useful in a classroom, and i think that it coyuld be useful in a classroom. I believe that i would keep many fights from happening because would be abe to stop it befor it happens even though the technology dosnt tell what your thinking it could extress your emothions and someone could just atlk to you about what going on before it was the go any farther. Also i think it would be a good idea to use ina classromm setting because wha if a studen thereats to be a school shooter and as a techer you jus let those words go over your head and a studen be serious that tehnology will determant the student emotions and i think you wouuld be able to base the feelings on their actions they said the would take. This would save student teachers etc from bring weapons into a school setting to protect themselves.

Also this would be a goood idea because in school some studen are just to shy to raise their hand in class to ask a question they would ofect express being confused through facial expressions and the teacher would be able to tell their confused, it would seperate the confused ones from the ones who understand. It also could work out well for the students you could be able to see how your teacher is feeling. Half the times some student just go to class not ac ting like a student but alos not knowing how their teacher is feeling, and I think if more people knew they would be more conciderent.
