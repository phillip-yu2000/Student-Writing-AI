Dear principal,

I think that kids should only be able to use there cell-phone if there is an emergency or before school they can use it or after school that's the only time kids should be able to use their phone. If they do take it into school they should keep it in there locker or off in there pockets if they bring it into class. I think this is a great idea because kids could just pull it out of there pocket and start using it when the teacher is not looking or paying attention. For example kids in my school play with there phones when the teacher is not paying attention or looking then they laugh about what's on there phone so then the teacher has to stop teaching and r remove the phone from the kids and then the teacher keeps it till the end of the day. Then the kids mom or dad has to come to school to get it from the teacher. In my school if you get caught with a phone the principal takes it and calls your parents to come to school and get the phone from the office.

If my mom had to come and get my phone she would take it home and put it somewhere i couldn't find it then I would be grounded for a month. Then when I would get it back I would have to put in my locker so i wouldn't get it taken away again. Just like in the video I watched before I had to do this writing piece some kid was using his phone when the teacher wasn't looking and kids open a book and then use there phone inside the book and text somebody so the teacher doesn't know what they are doing.
