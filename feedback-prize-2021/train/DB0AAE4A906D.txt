Cell Phones ... who doesn't have one? I mean cell phones are so cool, we can text our friends, communicate with our parents, get updated with the latest gossip, get on the internet, listen to music, and take pictures and videos! We all have our cells on us 24/7, even at school.

My thought is that, allowing these devices to be on during school hours and to be used during "free time" would be taken advantage of. The eight hours of the day at school is a teenagers "free time". Teens even now already use them during school, and some teachers say "You can have it out, as long as I don't see it or hear it". And, we still wonder why their are so many kids failing. So, yes I think people are going to take advantage of this privilege.

On these cell phones we all have a camera, or at least a good-quality one does. We also have either gym, or Physical Education. It has happened before and will continue, is taking pictures of girls or boys in the locker room. I mean it's just a photo of girls but, where that photo goes depends, Facebook, Myspace, a blog, somewhere in cyberspace. Even pictures of our teachers can be offensive to them and our school.

Why would we need them on in school anyways? We have the school phones! We are at school to learn for our future life, and to become better individuals not to socialize. We can socialize in our passing periods or even in sports!

So, as you can see having the privilege of having our cells on in school will be taken advantage of. Also they have cameras, to take mean photos of other students to post. We can text on the weekend, summer, breaks, and AFTER school. We can learn more if we just put them away for just eight hours!
