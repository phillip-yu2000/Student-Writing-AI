People always ask for advice or for other's opinions. People do that because they want another person's point of view of what they think. People's opinions are always different but sometimes they are the same. When opinions are different that is good because you have many options. When the opinions are the same you don't have many options. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by getting encouragement, trying something new, and doing something different.

First of all, one way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by getting encouragement. For example, if a person is going through a situation and that person is feeling upset, that person can ask someone else for advice or for their opinion. When that person gives you advice it make you feel happy that you talked to that person, because they helped you go through the situation.

Another reason seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by trying something new. For example, if you have spare time and is not dong anything, and you are doing something during that spare time, and it is the same thing, you could go ask other people what to do during your spare time. You could use their advice and try something new.

Lastly, seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice by doing different things. When you ask for advice from lots of people, they are all different opinions. So, if get different ideas you can do different things. Doing different things is fun for lots of people. Doing different things is new to everyone.

Getting encouragement, and trying new things, and doing different things are my reasons why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. These examples are ways how and why opinions can help others.
