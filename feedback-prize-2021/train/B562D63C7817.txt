Dear Principal,

I have heard you were going to consider changing school policy about at least having B grade average to participate in school events. I think that would be a good decision for not only the students, but also for the school. There are many students who just participate in events but do not study at all on their school work. Personally I believe that these activities are huge distractions to the students and take up the time after school for studying. All though I do have to admit that playing sports is a good thing for if a person wants a wants a scholarship to a university but then they also need the right grades to help them maintain the scholarship. Also so basically i believe that it would be great decision if you were to stop the C students from immersing themselves in distractions.

But if you were to let the B students participate in school activities they would probably become too distracted. Which would then lead to their grades falling thus turning them from B to C students very quickly. Unless students were able to do both work and enjoy school activities, there would be no need for this new policy. And also if you were to make this an actual policy, the school would look all the more better. A school where every student gets at least a B average, what kind of parent wouldn't send their kids to the place. Which lead to a bigger standard leading to more high graded students.
