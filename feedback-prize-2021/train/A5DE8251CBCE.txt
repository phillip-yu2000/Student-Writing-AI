Dear principal,

I strongly suggest that we have an absolutely no tolerance rule for phones. Phones all over the world everywhere are starting to cause major issues i our society. They have become a huge distraction in schools, homes and even businesses.

Allowing a zero tolerance policy on cell phones I believe can path the way to success for many generations to come. If we continue to let students bring their phone to school scandalous things can happen or continue to happen. With phones in students pockets we have no clue what they could be doing during anytime let alone a test! These students can be sending answers to one another, telling people what on the test, basically anything could happen. I believe if we allow absolutely no phones this won't be happening.

Also students could be sending inappropriate text messages. Plus with all this new and advanced technology today worse things can be done I ensure you that! Teenagers have been caught with disgusting pictures, depressing chain texts and just texts in general. This horrid thing has to be stopped this cannot go on!

So please help the community and have a zero tolerance policy cell phones. This solution I have come up with can not only help your school but everybody involved. It can help parents, teachers, board members and others. I hope this helps you on your final decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
