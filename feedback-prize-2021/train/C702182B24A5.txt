I support "Policy #1"

Dear Principal ,

As a student, I believe that students should be allowed to have cell phones during free times such as lunch and study hall. It's not fair that my classmates get punished for having a cell phone in a place that doesn't disrupt anyone. I don't see the problem in having cell phones during lunch.

If you aren't disturbing the peace in the lunchroom using your cell phone, why get punished for it? I hope you put this letter into consideration when making your decision on the policy.

First of all, it might be useful to use your cell phone in lunch or the like. You can call your parents to get you your homework if you forgot it, or just stop by and say hello. You can also talk to friends you don't normally see at school via text message. It's a great way to connect with people during lunch.

Second, using your cell phone during lunch is a waste of a detention or confiscation. Students question why they can't use their cell phone during lunch if it's not going to hurt anyone. The idea of getting a detention for using your MP3 or cell phone during lunch is questionable to me. Like I said before, the cell phone does not disturb the peace in the lunchroom. It's like arresting someone for a public disturbance at a rock concert. The environment in the lunchroom is loud, and I don't see how that "disturbs the peace."

I'm sure that everyone will agree with me that there is no problem in using a cell phone in the lunchroom will harm no one. The cell phone has it's place in school, and its in the lunch room. Aga
