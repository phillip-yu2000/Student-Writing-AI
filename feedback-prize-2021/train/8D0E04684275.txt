Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. Some of my friends do community service like tutoring younger children or cleaning up litter in parks. Others do not want to do community service because they feel it takes up too much of their free time to do other things. I on the other hand disagree with them. I'm sure you disagree also. I feel we should have students be required to perform community service as a requirement to graduate from high school. I think this because for one thing it would help out our community a lot and we would feel good about ourselves when we know we did a good thing.

I understand why some kids would not want to do community service because they may want to have fun doing other things with their friends or have a busy life. But that is no reason to not help out the community for one day! Lets say a group of kids wants to go to the park and play. When they get there the ground is covered in litter, so they leave and have nothing else to do. That is why we need to have students be required to do community service, so we will have clean parks to play in.

If every student in high school just volunteered for one weekend of community service the whole town and the citizens living in it would have a much better life. The citizens would have cleaner fairgrounds, nicer roads and sidewalks, and their sons and daughters would be more educated, if the students tutored them! The students would only have to do that much for the requirement, but they could do more if they would like.

In conclusion I think you should have community service be a requirement for all high school students for them to be able to graduate! I think this because it would make our community a safer, happier, and cleaner place to live in! I hope you take that into consideration.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
