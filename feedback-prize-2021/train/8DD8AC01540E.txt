I think that our principal should go with the first policy. I no a lot of kids that use there phones during class, and i think that if you use this policy the kids would loosen up more and stop using the phone is class, for the simple reason that they will get to use there phone during lunch and free time. the reason that kids use there phones in class is because they need to talk to a parent or gardenias about something. let them no that if they are using it in class o As long as the phone stays turned off at all times, if you are colt with the cell phone you get it taken away and you have big consequences.

policy number one is the best way to go,

i think because it gives the students more freedom and i think that is what most kids need these days, not under lock down ALL the time. Kids like to know that they can be trusted, and giving them the freedom to use there phones during school hours is a great why to show that. I understand why they had the rule off not being able to use the phone during class, but at lunch and on there own time i don't see why not. If the students free time is supposed to be studying and he uses his phone, don't make a big deal about it because that is his grade not yours.

when the students has no tine to use his or her cell phone during school they feel the need to use it during class. When the student uses the cell phone during class it takes away from the learning, you may think that is just like the free time, he should be studying but he is texting, it is different because that is his free time, this is in class. giving the student time to use his or her phone, to make phone calls, text a friend, or just have fun and take pictures may help out the "texting in class" problem. Students will know that they will have time to call and find out something before school is over. Please think about this and why you should really go with this policy, i know for a fact that there will be no texting in class.
