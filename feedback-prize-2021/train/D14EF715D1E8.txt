The "Face on Mars" was not created by aliens. There is alot of evidence that proves this is correct.

In paragraph three the passage states that the landform was a "Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth." This statement proves that aliens did not create this natural landform.

Paragraph seven also states the the image that was taken revealed a natural landform; Not an alien monument. People claimed that because it was a cloudy day when the picture was taken, the alien markings were hidden by haze. Scientists then took a picture of the landform on a clear, sunny day to prove them wrong; The picture was taken on April 8, 2001.

In paragraph eleven the article states that if there were any objects in the picture taken they would've been seen. In paragraph twelve the article says, "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." These sentences add to the fact that the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform.

These three paragraphs are just a few statements that prove that the "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. NASA is a very credible and trustworthy source to get this information from. Is your information about aliens credible?
