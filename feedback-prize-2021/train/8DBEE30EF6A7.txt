Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student of your school, I hope that students will have to be required to do community service. Doing community service will benefit students for their college and high school, make children realize that they need to help people other than themselves, and help solve some economical problems. Community service should be a requirement for students.

First of all, doing community service can benefit students for their college and high school, because the students will be able to talk about doing community service at their interview to get into the school, instead of saying " I did nothing other than do some sports and have good grades."

Third of all, doing community service can help solve some economical problems. Community service can be picking up trash to making houses. So shouldn't students be able to pick up trash? Even picking up trash isn't so hard. It's not like you will die from picking up trash, but the Earth is going through some problems because you are not picking up your trash! Earth is our home. We should take care of our home, for our home has treated us so well. Students can do a lot of things to help solve economical problems. Doing community service is one of the ways to solve the simple economical problems.
