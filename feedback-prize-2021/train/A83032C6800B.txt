Dear Mr. Senator, I have written this letter in hopes that you would change your mind about keeping the electoral college. Popular vote is the best method of voting because people's voices would be heard, and it would give more people the motivation to vote.

To begin with, you've probably herd the term democracy since thats what our government isÂ  right ? well that word comes from the latin words demo & kratia meaning people rule

. Popular vote would be better than the electoral college because then peoples voices can truly be heard, no scams, no funny buisness, just old fashion voting. Popular vote is also an easier and much more simple system than the electoral college. with popular vote all you do is look at the polls and see who has more votes as apposed to counting each and every states electoral points until you get 273.

In addition, if popular vote is put into action then it would inspire more people to vote, some citizens are very skeptical about the electoral collage but with popular vote the facts are in the polls. According to " The Indefensible Electoral College" by Bradford Plumer The electoral college is infair, outdated, and irrational.

In conclusion, Popular vote is a better idea than the electoral college because theres no funny buisness, and the peoples voices are truly heard. I hope this essay i wrote helped you make the right decision to drop the electoral college and switch to popular vote, if you have time to write me back that would be much appreciated.

sincerely, PROPER_NAME
