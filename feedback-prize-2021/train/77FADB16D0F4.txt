Phones and Driving

Drivers should not use a phone unless they are using it as a navigational device to get to a destination. If used in any other way it is very dangerous and will cause serious accidents to them and other drivers as well. Driving while using cell phones cause major problems that could've been avoided if they weren't using a phone. According to statistics in 2018 9 deaths and 1,000 injuries per day have occured due to distracted driving

One problem that cell phones cause while driving are swerving off of roads while driving at high speeds. Swerving could cause other drivers to have accidents because they tried to avoid the person that was swerving. If they weren't on their phones that probably wouldn't have happened.

Another problem is self proclaimed accidents. Some reasons this happens is because the person was probably texting while driving and they took their eyes off the road. This is the most common problem that people have mostly among teen drivers. It is 6 times more likely to cause an accident if someone is texting and driving that driving under under the influence.

Playing video games on cell phones while driving is another problem because people often like to have some type of entertainment while driving. This could often cause road rage while they are driving because something probably happened and they got mad. Some app developers have started making video game apps that blocks a person out of the app while they are driving.

All of these problems that are caused by cell phones can be avoided if people use their cell phones wisely. Improper use of cell phones put their lives and other people's lives in danger. A cell phone should be used for specific reasons only if not then they should not be used at all.
