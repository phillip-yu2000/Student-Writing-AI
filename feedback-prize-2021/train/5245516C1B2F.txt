The Cell Phone Policy

Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I believe that cell phones should not be allowed in school because of the fact that students will be tempted to text in class this has happened in school before. The seventh grade class had two students texting in class with out looking in the desk.

The policy here now is that if you bring your cell phone to school is that you have to give it to the teacher and wait till the day is over. This is why cell phones should not be allowed in school it leads to disruption of a class lesson. I f were to have a say in this i would do some thing about this.

If i could i would take all the cell phones in the school and lock them in a safe and never take them out not even my cell phone would be taken out. this way you can get your work done in class and not be disturbed at all during the lesson and i will be a lot more focused on my work and be at peace with my self.

This will help raise grades and improve test scores all over the nation and we will be able to compete with nations like Japan and China.

This will raise our test grades by ten percent and we will lose the current reputation that we as the city of Bridgeport have as a low grade school city. I think this is a good idea so can we please try it i think you will be happy with the results of this. So just think on it as tell me what you think about it. trust me it will work.

Sincerely
