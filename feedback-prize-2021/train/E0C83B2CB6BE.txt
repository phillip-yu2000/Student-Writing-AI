Do you think we need driverless cars? The cars Google founder Sergey Brin makes would use half of fuel of today's taxis. All of the driverless cars today need a actual driver. There are both positive and negative things about driverless cars but, I think that they are not neseccary.

I perosnally think that driverless cars are not worth getting because you still need a driver incase of bad road conditions. Whats the point of buying that very expensive car if your gonna have to eventually drive the driverless car. Say your in a rush for work and your on the phone with your boss butting on eyeliner and then it happends... you run into roadwork and your hands are all occupied and then you don't know what to do. That is another reason because you can crash and it wouldn't be safe for you or for any other people on the road.

In conclustion I believe that driverless cars are not neseccary nor safe enough to drive. I can see were people would think its good idea because they are efficent and can be a big boost in technology but Its not worth the bad saftey issue it has.
