I think policy one is the right thing because in a work place you should be trusted to be able to control your self and not text or make calls during work or school hours. Phones are a responsibility that students should be trusted with a phone.

I think we people text in school it is a sign if u can do to things at once more power to you if u can get good grades and text why not.

Teachers don't understand how important it is to be social if America wasn't social America we would not have the things we need. Us kids and young adults know what we need to do to get stuff done

Cell Phones are what that are making every thing work. If we didn't have cell phones things wouldn't get done. Study parties get planned when people talk to each other and know where people are

Teachers don't know kids don't text in class unless its boring so maybe the teachers should make class more exciting and more hands on so are hands cant be texting the whole time

All most all adults would not a agree with me they say "We were kids not to long ago". But adults don't understands things have change a lot since they were kids. When most adults were kids they didn't even know what a cell phones was.

Some of the kids that don't have cell phones may be resentful that they don't and that's why they say its such a big distraction. I really dint understand why really before i got my cell phone is 6th grade I didn't rat on anyone come on guys really just wait a few years and u will be having fun like the rest of us and you wouldn't want to be in trouble because of some kids that don't have one would? Think about it.

If the phone is being used in a free classes who cares its free that's what it is meant for. The teachers time isn't being wasted so why would it matter to them. Teachers want kids

So in cuclo
