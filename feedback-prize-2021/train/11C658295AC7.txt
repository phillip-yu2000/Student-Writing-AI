Dear principal ,

This letter would be to try to inform you about the issue that has been notified . Such as the new "Phone Policy" as you know there are two rule's in which you are trying to decide and so I hope this letter can help you decide into making the right choice .

My opinion , about the "Phone Policy #2 "

would be that it should be selected . The reason would be because many students often don't pay attention during schools when having a distraction in their hands. Policy #1 does state to let kids use phone's during free times or so and to turn off their phone's during class sessions . Now it's not a bad idea but the problem would be that some students would not just turn their phones off when entering class because some of them don't really follow the rules as you know . Second , of all if students are let to have the freedom into having their phones in free times they can be texting each other the test answers or so . These would obviously be a major issue within School education system . Now if the #2 policy is chosen then students would not have the distraction of checking or playing around with their phones during class times or texting about tests answers or , homework answers . By this happening the students would have the ability of paying attention to their lessons as they are commanded to do .

Many kids take their phones to call their parents for when to pick them up or an emergency . Now if they need a phone for one of those emergencies they can use the office phone where there can be a supervisor that would secure that they are using the phone for a good purpose. As you may know parents send their students to learn and so in some situations this doesn't happen because kids are getting often distracted with their "Technology! "

In conclusion , that would be my opion about what policy should be selected for the school . Well thhis only explains my opion about it but at the end the final desciocion is yo

Sincerely ,

A fellow student
