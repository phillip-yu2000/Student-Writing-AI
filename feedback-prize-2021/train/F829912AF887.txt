Dear Principal,

I support changing the policy. students should not be able join a particular sport team until they have reached a B average GPA. However, if they fall below a B average, they will not be able to participate in competitions, nevertheless practices are still mandatory. Having academic probation as a consequence encourages students to focus on their studies and participate in an extracurricular activity.

Even though many students currently have a C average, participating in sports could be deleterious to a students performance in school if they are not required to hold a certain GPA. Many high schools have academic probation as a consequence when participating in school sports teams, and the students use this as motivation to work harder in school. If our school changed our policy so that students would need to maintain a B average GPA, many students would become more focused on their grades.

On top of having the students more motivated to work hard in school, this policy would teach students that participating in an extracurricular is a privilege and if you abuse that privilege, there are consequences. If the students decide to only focus on sports and see it as a way to avoid there studies, there should be consequences. joining a sport should not be a frivolous activity, it should be viewed as a privilege. If you excel in school, you are then allowed to join a sporting team.

I believe that altering the policy will be beneficial to our school. if students are required to hold at least a B average GPA, students will be more dedicated on their schooling. they will also view joining a sporting team as a privilege. I extremely support changing our school policy.

Sincerely,

Your pupil
