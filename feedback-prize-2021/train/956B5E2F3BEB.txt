Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should be allowed to use cell phones as long as they are turned off during class. For one thing cell phones are not used frequently, a student only uses them for emergencies. On a students cell phone there is a calculator which can be used in math class to check their work. The students can only use their phones for emergencies or during their free time. A lot of students check the time or time themselves during class so they won't waste time staring at the clock. Cell phones are used to browse on the internet when they don't have computers.

If a student uses their phone during free time it would most likely cause them not to use it during class. Say if a student vomited on the floor why waste time looking for the parent's number, you can simply get the child's cell phone and use contacts to find out the parent's number. Say a student breaks their leg, it will take forever to reach the phone all the way across the room, use the child's cell phone to dial 911. Think cell phones, think safe.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
