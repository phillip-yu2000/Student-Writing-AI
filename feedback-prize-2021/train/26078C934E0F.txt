Dear

TEACHER_NAME,

I am a student of SCHOOL_NAME Middle school and I think that every student should participate in community service. Community service is a great way for students to learn respect of not only their community but the planet as well.

I'm sure they will think twice before littering if they clean up trash or learn to be responsible if they help out at the local animal shelter. This can teach the students so many things while helping the community. If every student participated in community service then maybe at the end of the year we could have a fun day. We could have something like a carnival or let the students vote and pick a fun day activity. This kind of school activity would motivate the students to get out and be active in the community.

If you just show everyone how fun it can be then maybe kids would be more inspired to get out and even take their friends and parents to help out the community. If our school can't do community service then maybe we could at least start recycling which does still help out the community but we wouldn't have leave the classroom.

So please consider all of my ideas.

your student,
