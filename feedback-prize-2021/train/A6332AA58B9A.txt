with all the new advancements in technology driverless cars have become more and more of a possibility. as these advancements are made more and more people think that its a good idea to have driverless cars. people think they are so innovative and amazing, but what they dont understand is, technology doesnt always work correctly.

Driverless cars seem so funand like the next big thing, which they might be, but people could get caught up in the fancyness of them and no tknow all they should about them. the main thing is, technology, while handy, doesnt always work. and if you put all your trust into it, who know what you mightbe missing. most people will see driverless cars as an excuse to not really pay attention to driving. when in fact, like the article said, a driverless car is not completely driverless. you cant just put all your trust into the car thinking nothing can go wrong and it can deal with anything the roads throw at you.

If you put all your trust into a machine, it may backfire. people dont understand that while on the road, no matter the kind of care you have, you always need to be paying attention to what is happening infront of you. and if you crash who will be blamed, you or the manufacturer of the car? was the problem that you werent paying attention, or that they built the car wrong. in the grand scheme of things, driverless cars seem like such a good idea, but with this generation people rely way too much on technology. we rely on our smart phones to remember everything for us and remind us of everything. if we depend so much on technology people wont understand that even if you dont have to do everything while driving in the future, you still need to stay alert. if you are in the road with a basically metal box weighing over 1,000 pounds you need to be alert and focused on whats happening at all times. and if we introduce driverless cars into this world, people wont stay focused on the road.
