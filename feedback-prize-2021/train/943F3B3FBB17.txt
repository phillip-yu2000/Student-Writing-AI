Dear principal,

I believe that you should go with policy number two which says no cell phones are allowed in school. There are many reasons why i say this. One reason why is because most of the students will have different phones from each other. Some peoples phones will be better than others. Students will not like that so they will result to stealing cell phones. Then the school will be taken over by violence. And you don't need that in your school. Another reason why cell phones should not be allowed in school is because they can go off in the middle of class and distract the whole entire class from learning. One the phone goes off everyone starts laughing and everyone gets off task. Then everyone starts talking about the ring tone. Then the teacher has to get the class back in order because of the huge distraction a cell phone caused. This is why cell phones should not be allowed in the school.
