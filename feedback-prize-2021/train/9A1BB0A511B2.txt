Students should not have to have a b average to play sports, because it is already c average which is c' s and b' s. What is that not good enough for you. We are already try our hardest to get good grades and play sports. All I'm trying to say is that students love sports and love to play it and watch it. and if we have to have a b average or higher to play sports than that team is not going to be good.

That team is not going to be good because there will be less practices, the team will be busy studying. They will be focusing a whole lot more on what was for homework and do we have a test tomorrow. Then your guys high school team will be at the bottom and i don't think we want that.

Another thing is that if you make it a b average than i now a whole lot of people that will not like you. And I think you want people to like you so you can be more cooler with us. So it is your choice, keep it at a c average or b average.
