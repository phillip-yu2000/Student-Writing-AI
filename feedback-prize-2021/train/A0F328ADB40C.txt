I believe that students should not be allowed to have their phones at school and use them when they are not in class.

Most students that bring their phones to school need them after school to call and see who is going to pick them up, or if they are going to go walking. If students have their cell phones with them and they are using them during non class time. They will take the advantage and use their cell phones during class. This will make them not want to pay attention in class. The phone will be the distraction and keep them from not wanting to pay attention and learn anything. The phone make a distraction to the rest of the class as well and therefore makes the learning environment a non learning class. When students don't have their phones with them in class it makes them just want to sit in their chair and just listen to the teacher.

Teachers as well would say that students should not have their phones at school, because they are tired of taking it away and tired of hearing it ring or vibrate during the class time. Teachers should make the learning for the students exciting so they don't get bored and not want to make the student use their phone during class.
