Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hello named

STUDENT_NAME

I don't think that you should make the students with a C average stop doing sports. The reason why I think that is because some students really love sports. Sports is like school you work as a team and you work hard on the job. I know there are students here who like sports and have excellent grades but not everyone. Some students were made to do great in school but some aren't .

The main thing is that students that have bad grades shouldn't have to force themselves to doing a great job in school with all A' s and B' s because some thing may be difficult and they get a C on it. Also there is after school tutoring that way if they need help on any work they can stay with the teacher and catch up on what they need done or help on . For a example me I love school and sports and I don't have all A' s and B' s. At points you really have to think of what the students think they may have the same feeling but we want to have fun and do sports to support the schools and ourselves. So what I'm trying say just let the students have fun and be active and support our school with good grades and with being active. So then when they get older and what to be a professional athlete they have to have good grades to make it so I see where you get that from . Its very important to have good grades in life because school is what actually helps us on anything .

Sincerely,
