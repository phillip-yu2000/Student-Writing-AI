Do you need good advice? Well I know the best way to get good advice its simply to just ask multiple people. Some benefits of asking more people is that you can get the best piece of advice and you get more options to choose from.

You can get the best advice by asking multiple people. When you get more information you can take what most people say and use that advice. The more advice that was given to you can help you make a better choice of what you should do.

When you get multiple pieces of advice people are sure to repeat the same type of advice. The piece of advice most people said is the best piece of advice.

When you ask more people you are gonna get different answers but that is good. When you get all that advice you can just think about the options people gave and choose the one that you think works best for you.

You should always ask more than one person for many reasons.

When you ask people you are guaranteed to get better advice and more that just one piece of advice. Therefore you should always ask multiple people for advice rather than just one person.
