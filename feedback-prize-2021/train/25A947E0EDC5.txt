The article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" mentions may things about all the problems with going to Venus. Then, it is said how those problems could be fixed. These are all to support the authors claim. From examining the risk vs. reward of going to mars for exploring that was used in the text and the simple soutions that have baffled the world for 3+ decades, it's clear that the author got through with the message he was trying to convey.

What I've learned fromt the text is that traveling to Venus for a fair amount of time could be a very momentus event in history, but it will be very arduous to reach that goal. There were several dangers listed; temperature, air pressure, lightning, volcanoes, etc. "While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely". (Paragraph 1) These were also problems that were tackled by the author. He relenquishes all of the huge problems and proves that going to Venus could be worth it.
