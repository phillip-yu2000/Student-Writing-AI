Hi, I am Luke and we want you to jointhe Seagoing Cowboys. We need you to help us help other countries who are in need of clothing and stuff.

Okay there are some cons when it comes to this job. One is that you have to cross oceans a lot when you are a Seagoing Cowboy. To be a Seagoing Cowboy you have to be an extremely hard worker. Lastly you might get sea sick, because we travel by boat when going across seas, so if you don't get sea sick then come along with us to the Seagoing Cowboys.

Okay now you have heard enough cons let's hear the pros about being a Seagoing Cowboy. One you get to help other countries after bad situations. You also get the benefit of seeing Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, and the Panama Canal. You get to experience that other countries are in need and we need tohelp them. Lastly you get to play a lot on the boats,

so it passes the time, so you are not bored. So please join the Seagoing Cowboys we need you.
