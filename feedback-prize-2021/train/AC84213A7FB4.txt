The Seagoing Cowboys is a great program, but being one is better. The cowboys go to fun places like China and Europe. But it is also a lot of hard work too, Luke had to care for the animals during crossings, the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship.

After the animas had been unloaded the cowboys would had some freetime to play volleyball and baseball. They also play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing to help pass the time. When they have a long trip and a lot of freetime they visit places, like when Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys could go basically anywhere. They went to China, Europe, Greece, and Crete. At the age of 18 Luke could be drafted for military service, but since he was on a cattle-boat trip, they told him he could do that for his service. So if your a Seagoing Cowboy it counts as being in the military service.

My conclusion is being a Seagoing Cowboy can "open someones eyes" to the needs of animals. Like Luke said, "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." Seagoing Cowboys are very persistent, and if you like animals you should join this program. Because when Luke fell and slid on the ship, he almost fell off because he was helping the animals. And when Luke cracked his ribs on the ship, he didn't quit, he kept being a Seagoing Cowboy, and continued to help the animals. The Seagoing Cowboys care more about the animals than they do themselves, and that is great. Because it might be hard work but the animals need all the help they can get.
