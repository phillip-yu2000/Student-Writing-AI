I think that the FACS is good idea. I feel as if this could be useful in many ways to the public. I ecspecially think that benefit towards the teenage community. Believe it or not, there are a massive amount of emotionally damaged teenagers that have a hard time expressing how they feel.

The F.A.C.S is could make huge impact. People that have gone through emotional tolls in their lives, and don't know how to express how they feel would finally have an outlet. This could be of major use to psychiatrist with patients that have a hard time expressing themselves.

Not only could it benefit you at home, but it could be of great use in school. Such as, when you're in class and you don't understand the lesson. The FACS could recognize that you are confused about the subject and simplify it for you. Or say your being bullied and you are to scared to tell. Well the FACS could sense that and help you with the situation.
