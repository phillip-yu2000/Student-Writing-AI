I know that people are saying that this is proof that aliens inhabit Mars, but trust me, this is not proof. I wish this was proof. It's exactly what we need to hear right now. It's exactly what we've been needing to hear for years. We wan't to find evidence of life on Mars, so why would be hide any signs from you?

If you still don't belive me, look closer at it. Some images the face is more clear than others. That means that the eyes and nose that you see are just shadows. Aliens wouldn't make an artifact that only looks like a face from certain angles. They would want it to stand out.

Some of you say that the alien markings are hidden behind the wispy clouds. Well, we checked again at a time when it was clear and you could see everything fine. There were no alien markings. Like I said, if there were we would have been extatic. The whole world would have known about it within a few days.

I know it has become a huge pop icon, and I'm sorry yo ruin this for you, but it has to be done. It's just a landform. It's very common around the American West. It resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If you still want to think that it's a face created by aliens then be my guest. Nobody can stop you.

For those of you who now believe that it's a natural land mark, Nasa is just as disapointed as you. We wanted it to be created by aliens too. It would be pretty nice to finally have actual proof in the existence in aliens. Hopefully our trip to Mars will help us find proof in their existence.
