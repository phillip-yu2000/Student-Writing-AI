Online courses and receiving your education at home can be beneficial in many ways due to the fact that you're technically not in "school" for seven hours a day learning. For this very reason, being home schooled and having online courses gives you the chance to have more time to do your work, reevaluate, and overall to take as long as you may need, and whats important is feeling comfortable and moving at your own pace.

Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life.

Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, sometimes you'll need a buddy to help out or you'll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong.

You're not always going to know everything, you have to give yourself the chance to open up and have the opportunity so that you could expand your knowledge of education, there's a point in time where you've got to say ask a classmate or teacher for help, and Im not speaking on the behalf of everyone but thats how people are, they think they can learn everything there is to know about something but you've got to take a step back and know when to say hey and say these five simple words and that is, "may I get help please".

Therefore I do Indeed agree that taking online classes is a great way to benefit off of beacause people may feel that they can work on their own and move at their own pace and overall just have an amazing experience at the end of the day.
