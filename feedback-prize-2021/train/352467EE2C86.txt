Dear. State Senator

Electoral College should we keep it or change it, to election by popular vote? Well alot of people dislike it and some like the electoral college. There are certian asspects about both electoral college and election by popular vote that should be looked at closey before you choose which one works and wich one dosen`t.

Keeping electoral college I believe its best for our voting proccess.

Why because in 2012 Oboma received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes. His percentage with popular vote was 51.3 percent, so if you voted for him electoral college bumped up his percent by a good amount. The electoral college also helps avoid problems of the elections such as no candidat receives a majority of the votes that were cast. Electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose by vitue of the ma-apportionment, witch means to me that larger states have larger percentages and between the two candidates the percents can be close so the electoral college just helps us pick one of the candidates.

Popular vote has some good asspects to it aswell. Popular vote helps bump up your percentage of votes before electoral college is added, so it makes it an even better chance for the candidate you voted for to win the election. I believe people perfer popular vote because to me if I'm correct popular vote is the amount of votes acandidate got from the people and I know alot of people like it when their choice gets picked and no one else tried to i guess you could say meess with the votes.

Electoral to me is the way to go so I believe you should keep it. It seems that it gives candidates a better chance of their percentage going up so the have a better chance of winning.
