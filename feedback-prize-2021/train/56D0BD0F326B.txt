I am Luke, a Seagoing Cowboy. There are many amazing things to experience while participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The journeys are long, but there are spectacular things wating for you along the way. Views are breathtaking, and you get to handle animals. There are many reasons why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The animals are great. They wouldn't survive a few days without the care of a Seagoing Cowboy. There are horses, cows, and mules in need of care for floating across the sea. Only a Seagoing Cowboy can keep these adorable animals safe. These animals need you.

"Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special." (5) You too can see amazing places and experience once in a lifetime things when you're a Seagoing Cowboy. Places are beautiful and you get to see them. It's a once in a lifetime choice.

The journeys are long and hard, but at the end, you have lots of fun. After animals are unloaded, you can play. You can have fun playing baseball and volleyball in empty holds where animals had been housed. If you're bored, you can have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, whittling, reading, and other games. After hard work, you can have fun.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is amazing. Not only do you help the world, you have fun along the way. The world needs you. No one could handle animals and get them places safely without you. Become a Seagoing Cowboy and save the world.
