When you think about a presidential election you think about getting the chance to make a difference in the country and make a big descison that may affect your life as well as everyone in the country. The electoral college should be abolish and mad to where the elections are fair. It should be change because it doesn't allow people to vote for the candidate that is running for president. The electoral college not only allows people to take away a popluar votebut they can also give to whomever they choose to give it to. But it can cause a very big problem just like it did in 1960 when the segregationist tried to get new electors who would oppose Jonh F. Kennedy.

Because of the winner take all system these candidates don't even go and vist some states beacuse they know they wouldn't have a chance of winning. This can also lead to some states not having the chance to ever see or meet the candidate just like in 2000 campaign seventeen states didn't have a chance of seeing the candidates at all. If you wanted to vote for a candidate you wouldn't have a chance to vote because you would have to vote for electors pledged to that candidate. Most of everyone in the counrty would have to vote whomever the electors are who are pledged to that canddidate which isn't fair. So the electoral college should be changed to where everyone can vote for any candidate they want because it's not only fair but rational and agreeable.
