Dear principle,

Students should play sports at school if they have a C it shouldn't be fair if the children with a B grade average. So you should let the students who have

C play sports at school. In matter of fact you should let all the students play sports at school because they will get some exercise. So you should let all of your students play sports.

It will be fun to play with their friends and talk to them. The students should work in all of the activities that you plan. It would be fun for them and they think you will be a principal. so you cane be a fair principal if you let them be in any activities of any kind like sports. Then they will go to field trips.

So if you let them join any activities then they will like you. I know that they will be happy and they will always like you. If you are nice for the rest of your life then the students will like you for their rest of their lives. So you should always be nice to the students then they will come back to see you. But the people who fail should go to chorus recovery instead of being in the activities.

It will be for everyone at the school. Everyone should try to do the activities first. So if you are nice to the students then they will talk to kids to go to that school. Then they will let their children to go to that school if are nice to them. So you should be nice to your students so they can bring their kids there. So your school doesn't go out of business. Then everyone will like you. So you can love your kids. So the parents will like you too. Then everyone c
