I think driverless-cars wiil have a positive impact on society. the reason why I think this way is because, it can provide transportation to everyone. It will also cut down the use of fuel, so it would make the world much more green. different car companies are still working on the cars to make them more safer and to make them more efficient, transportation wise. Nissan, Audi, Mercedes-Benz plan to have driverless cars by 2020.

Although there might be some challenges with having the driverless car out on the road, companies have improved on many problems the cars had. One of the problems would be braking. Companies have created new ways to help the driver in the driverless car be more safer. New ideas such as vibrating seats to let the driver know when the driver is in danger of backing into something. Another one is announcing when the driver needs to take the wheel when there is dangerous road conditions it cant handle.

Even though self driving cars look like it is ready to take the, many people belive the car is still dangerous. the reason why is because the laws in some states say that a vehicle must have a person fully operating the vehicle for it to be safe. so, in conclusion self driving cars will have a great impact on the world.
