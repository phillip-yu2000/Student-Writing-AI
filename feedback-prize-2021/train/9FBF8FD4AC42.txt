In the text,"The challenge of Exploring Venus" it says that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. On paragraph 5 it says, " NASA's possible solution to the hostile coditions on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray." I says that NASA does more studying they are going to sent people to study Venus. while, they are studying for Venus they can float around Venus and see it around and how it looks like. In paragraph 7 it says," NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions." NASA has been trying to study Venus for a long time and they are trying to approach it so they are sending people to study Venus and they have made some inventions. They have been sending it with people that are going to venus and trying it out. NASA is trying to do something with computers called Mechanical Computers. These computer are going to be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. The computer are going to be more better than out computer and phones. In many ways is going to be hard because it does have some risk factor to go to Venus but they are trying to find new inventions are diging up old inventions like the mechanical computers. In many ways I would want to go but then I wouldn't because their is some risk to it.
