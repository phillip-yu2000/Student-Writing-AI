It's good if you ask more then one person for answer is cause. If you ask more then one person for advice it gives you more options to choose from. Also it gives you more of an understanding from the other person. Another reason is it gives you more accurate reasons then just one persons. If you need help then usually more then one person's opinion would help. But say you give someone an example then of your friend's or someone close,that you trust they would give there honesty. Another reason is if you have more then one person you trust then they wouldn't lie neither would they tell. Usually if you ask more then one person the same question, you might get the same answers or some what close to the same answers. To add on to that would sum everything down into one. Now say if you ask someone for advice they could be lying or just not know, so that's why if you ask more then one person for advice that would help. But usually if you need help or advice ask an adult cause they've more then likely have had the same questions as you. Plus if you want to ask someone for advice or need help and no one knows you can just use the internet more than likely they have an answer. Also if you need an example of something and your friend's reply does't sound right, just look it up on Google or any other website. Google or any other website would give you a more reasonable and more understanding answer. Now not everything on the internet is true but you can still ask more then1 people or go on more then one website too see if there example or advice is true. But to sum everything up, if you need help, or advice, or an example, or have a question to always ask more then one person cause you never know what they are telling you could be completely true.
