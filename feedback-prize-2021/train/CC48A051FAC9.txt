Should extracurricular activities be mandatory?

Don't think that making extracurricular activites mandatory is good for us students? Well let me go ahead and share my thoughts and maybe you will change your mind. I believe this would be a good addition to the school. I have many reasons for my opinion but here's two, Making new friends, and it's great for oppurtunities.

Well first off, friends are a great addition to someones life, they help you through mostly everything you go through. So when you take an activity like this it helps you to meet new people which consequently can make new friends. With all of this in mind, why not take the oppurtunity? I get that maybe your shy or something like that, but you at some point in life you need to expand your territory and meet new people.

Another great reason would be the oppurtunites you get. If you didn't already know, the more extracurricular activites you take the better your record will look for college. Which also means the easier you get into the bigger and better education college's. Not only that but you also get oppurtunities that other kids wouldn't, including field trips, getting to meet famous people, and even being on national tv. Now with that in mind, doesn't it sound fun to take these type of things? All it does is make you the best person you can be.

So in conclusion, taking these activites would be a phenomenal experience and a great boost to your college applications. I think that doing this would greatly impact the school to be better students. Just because I listed two reasons doesn't mean that that's all of the advantages to it, there are plenty more.
