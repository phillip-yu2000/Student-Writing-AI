Dear Principle,

Community service is very important for our community. It helps our environment and the community. Many people around the world participate in all the community service there is to keep this world healthy for us to live in. We can find many things around our community to help out with. Even if we don't have much time we can help with the simple things there is to do.

I think students should be required to have at least 17 hours of community service. But just for their last year at the school. It shouldn't be mandatory for those students who are in the lower grades. The school should make students realize that we need help in the environment and laziness from them wont help.

For community service students can help to get the hours they need to get in to clubs, school teams, and school participations such as SCHOOL_NAME, the yearbook committee and student council. I think community service to me is not a waste of time, i like participating in anything that will help my community and myself.

For example the community service stuff we do is collecting can goods, tutoring for students, helping teachers on anything they need, Make a Difference Day, Red Ribbon, recycling, helping with student council and helping out in our school community.

Sincerely,

Your former student STUDENT_NAME
