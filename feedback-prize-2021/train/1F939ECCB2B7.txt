why the principle can't make choses for us

Would you participate in extra activity if you were force to do it? Well ,the principle is thinking that student's must participate in extra activity. I disagree,because some kids don't want to do activities,and some students are too shy to be with other students.

Some student choose not to because of reasons. Some kid have strong reason why not to participate. It should be a students chose weather or not to participate in these stuff. Students already have classes why should they be forced to do extra activity if they don't want to. In conclusion ,some kid have several reason some are good some are not.

Some student have inanity or they are shy to be with other people. inanity is an problem to many specially with other people. Some student are shy and don't make many friends and when they do activity they don't have people to talk to. Shy people have rick of being bulled when doing things wrong. In conclusion ,some people are shy to don't do extra activity because they worry they would miss thing up and be bulled.

I disagree, because some student have good reason and some are bad,and some students are shy and worry if they miss up. The principle is thinking that students must participate is extra activity. I highly disagree with the principle because he should not make chooses for us so go and tell your friend and lets convise the principle together.
