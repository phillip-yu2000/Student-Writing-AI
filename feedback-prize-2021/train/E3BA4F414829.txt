Dear Principal,

The students of our school think that this policy is not fair. We think that we should have a D or F average to stop participating in school sports and other activities. We, the students, agree that if because of certain reasons grades are slipping, we will work to keep our grades up to continue with the sport or activity we participate in . If our grades are a B- and up we will continue to keep our grades up and be good students. Students with a C average will continue to work hard, study, and make better grades instead of taking the risk of letting grades slip.

Certain sports may be hard to work school around. For example football is a very important sport at our school and the players work hard at practice, they will continue to work around practice and get all their study time in to make the grades and stay on the team. Your policy will continue to make the students work harder but it is to fair to many. Some may have a C average but they may be working as hard as the others who have an A average. Some may not be able to understand the curriculum. This will change the student body drastically.

In conclusion the policy of only allowing students with a

B average join sports and other activities will not allow students to play certain sports and participate in clubs and other activities that they are interested in. We will be glad if you would continue with the current policy. We would hope that this helped you view our opinion on this topic.

Thank You

Sincerely,

Your Students
