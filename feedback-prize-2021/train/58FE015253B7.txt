To The Principal:

Students that participate in sports should at least have a

B average. school always comes first. But

I think it should only be counted in your core classes. Students will do better n classes that improve your knowledge but classes like physical education and elective classes don't really help you learn. They do in some ways but the core classes are the main classes parents want there children passing.

In a way I disagree and agree. Students of course should have high grades in subjects like history, language arts, math, and science but not physical education.

After a morning practice if your involved in sports your usually worn out and your muscles are soar. Then the coach requires them to run or do physical activities. There sport participation should count as a physical education grade. Of course they should still learn about ways to stay physically fit but being to active tires out your body sometimes.

I agree with having at least a b average to be able to participate in activities. If your graders are low and your not being respectful in school you shouldn't be able to participate in school activities. Activities are used to reward you for your hard work and improvement. No one should be able to have fun until they have improved grades and are well mannered in school.

I think that's a good rule for being in rewarding activities and sports but in a way not for sports because its tiring and it causes muscle pains.

I'm for and against this cause because learning should be a top priority for everyone. And activities should be given to those who deserve it . But being in a sport and physical education isn't really fair to those who are in them. Being in a sport should automatically make your

P.E. grade an A

but you should still participate to your full ability.
