Dear Principal,

I think community services is good for people. It could help clean up dirty communities, or helping older people with thing, or helping little children with things too.

I think it is a good idea to have a community services projects in school. you could either help someone with things or clean up communities of trash. Other people should at least try community service before judge it.

I would chose helping little kids with homework or sports training or musical talents. It could help you on getting into a good college and a good job. You could become a teacher or world helper.

It would help make you more active outside. It would stop you for being lazy and doing nothing to help. you could get a citizenship award for helping the town.

That is why I think people should do community services projects for the school. please consider this a good thing. It would help the planet and make it cleaner and may stop global warming.

Your student,
