Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Many kids and parents thing that you should not allow students to have phones at school at all because of our grades. But to be honest I think you should pick Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. The reason why I think that you should pick police number one is because there are some times when teachers don't let us go to the office to use the phone and teacher are not allow to let students use the phone in the class. Some times we feel so bad and we ask for permission to go to the nurse and teacher don't allow us go or if we go to the nurse they don't do nothing to make us feel better. Another reason why I think you should pick police number 1 is because what about if there is on accident in our families how are we gonna be able to know. I know that our parents can call the office to let us know but I think we should still have our cell phones with us. When our parents don't know if they are gonna be able to know if they are gonna come and pick us up from school, how are we gonna be able to know. If you let us have our cell phone in school we promise you that we are not going to use our cell phones during class time. We are not gonna bring our grades down. Well TEACHER_NAME this are my reasons why I think you should pick Police number 1.
