Dear principal,

I think that it should not be a mandatory thing to do because. Some people might have other very important things to do. It would be nice to have people do community service to help older people around with yard work or something but. I still thing it shouldn't be a mandatory thing to do it should be a option. If you really think it should be a mandatory thing then just make it an elective for people in middle school and in high help.

Whoever signs up they will go to elementary schools and help the younger children out on there homework. And or go to local parks or activity centers and help clean up ,like pick up trash and recycle it. You could even send a letter out to all homes. And tell parents that there is a new after school activity and you can take the kids place to help tutor or to help clean building clean local parks and even i the summer time they could go to people and help cut the grass or.

Help rake leaves in the spring time. Tell the how good it would make them fell after the work is done. They will fell like they have accomplished a big and important goal. But it cant be mandatory because if you think about it kids my have lots of homework or they might have a test the next day and they have a lot of studying to do. They might have after school activities they might have a lot of things to do and to make them do something else that would be mandatory is not really fair.
