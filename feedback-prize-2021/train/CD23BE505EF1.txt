Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Which shouldn't be allowed while driving because you could cause serious matters for you and everyone surrounding you. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. The feeling is that young drivers find it enough of a challenge to operate a car, and that any distractions are dangerous. The punishment you get for using a hand-held phone while driving is commensurate with how dangerous that behaviour. A part of the problem is people may answer an email or text they consider to be urgent while driving and because they don't have an accident, they think it's safe to do again. Ways to prevent this from happening; Put your phone away while driving. Putting your phone on mute or turning your phone off entirely is a sure-fire way you to avoid being distracted by it while you're driving. Have a conversation with people in your car or on the phone (even hands-free).To break these habits, people can either turn off their phone or put it on silent before driving. This will force them to concentrate on the road only. But if this method doesn't work on some people, you can use Siri to command your phone to read your messages or to reply back. Texting is a major factor when it comes to crashes and creating a hazardous situation, so preventing the usage of cell phones while driving would be a large step in limiting the number of crashes that happen in the United States. There are multiple associations that are already trying to prevent cell phone usage.
