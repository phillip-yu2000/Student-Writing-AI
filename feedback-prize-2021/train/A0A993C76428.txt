Everyone know cars are bad for the environment, but it is also bad for you. It ruins our planet and stresses us out.

By limiting cars that 12 percent can go to a 6 percent or mabe lower. To add to that cars make a very big amout of smog. In the passage " Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog" it says " Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog." that has to be a huge amount of smog fo congestion to be down 60 percent! Most of that smog id made by cars. To limit cars is to limit Pollution.

In addition cars bring people down. In the passage " Car-Free Cities " they ban cars one of the citizens, Heidrun Walter, a media trainer said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,". As you can tell with no cars she is a happier person. Not only that but, in the passage "Car-Free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota" businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said " It's a goo opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution," saying bye to cars helps ake away stress.

In conclution, getting rid off cars is a great way to relive stress and fix our environment. Car only pollute our air and gives us stress, without cars will do much better!
