Dear Principal,

I think that kids should do community service because they benefit them in a lot of ways. A lot of kids spend their time playing video games or doing nothing. The community service will teach them how to do other things. Tutoring can help prepare for a carer in teaching because it gives the tutors patience. If they pick up litter they can promote others to help clean parks lakes and make a healthier environment for everyone.

Some of the community services can give people experience so when they get older getting a job can be easier. It can also give them responsibility like being in charge of a cleaning group. It gives them the leadership skills they may need to run a company or run a family. They will also get to know people of the community.

Some kids think community service takes too much of their time. I wont lie it does take some time, but some kids spend weekends doing nothing. Community service has a lot of options that they can choose from. Some kids like to ride bikes, so they can consider Meals-On -Wheels. Later when they start working at a fast food restaurant they can deliver the food.
