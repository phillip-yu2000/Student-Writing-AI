In the article it states that a " Long time ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth today ." This shows that Venus wasonce probably just like how earth is today . You couldve probably lived there and made a whole new life there . Also the text says " The planet has a surfave of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." This shows how Venus is just alike to earth and that maybe we should consider exploring Venus more.

The idea in the article that they came up with is that they wanted us to imagine a "vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles abover the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level om Earth." This is showing that humans can possibly live on Venus . Its not "eady conditions" to live in but they can. They should explore Venus some more and come up with a idea so people can possibly start a life there. This would benefit a lot of people because what if something really bad happened to earth then people could stay on another planet and we can have Venus as a back up plan if anything goes wrong .

In conclusion, NASA should consider exploring Venus because its would benefit a lot of people. Having another planet to live on would possibly lower the population on earth and would make it easier for everyone. It can also be a "backup planet" incase anything happened to the planet earth and lastly we can see how it is to live different as surive in a different planet .
