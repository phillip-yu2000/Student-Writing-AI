dear principal, i think students should be allowed to bring cell phones to school during the school day. It is important to allow students to have them incase of a emergency . cell phones are also important to have because they are very useful if something goes wrong they are able to call 911 or 311 for personal help. They should also be allowed because cell phones is a good way to let students keep contact during school free hours.

It is important to let students have them incase of a emergency . A lot of students can use their phone if they have been hurt . If a student gets bullied by other peers they can call the school and let them know that someone has been hurt by other students from school. If something bad had happen to that student during school hours they can always use their cell phone.

they are also useful to have because sometimes a lot of things can go wrong.

Students at some point we have accidents like spilling milk on our shirts or not making it to the washroom and we can use our phone to call mom and dad to bring us extra clothing. cell phones are not always to text but also just a good thing to have during school.

you never know what can happen during the end of the day like going home. Their are so many dangerously things that can happen and its important to have a cell phone to call 911 . and they are cool to be allowed during free classes and be able to use them at some point during our day.(:
