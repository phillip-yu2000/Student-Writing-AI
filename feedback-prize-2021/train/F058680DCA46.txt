Have you ever gotten advice from other people? If you haven't then you probably should and here is why, some people have been around longer than you, so you won't get just one opinion, and some people just want the best for you.

The first reason why is that some people have been around longer that you. Given that they have been around for longer they will know what they are talking about and have seen more things than you have. An example of this is when I wanted help so I asked my grandparents for help because they knew more than me and what do you know they knew the answer.

The second reason is so that you don't get only one opinion. If you were to get an opinion for only one person than you have no way of knowing whether that opinion was biased or not. For me I think the more opinions that you get the easier it is to sort out the biases. Also the more opinions that you get the more you can see who liked what. say you were going to an amusement park and you wanted to see what rides that were fun to ride on, so you asked all of your friends what rides were fun to do. You would not of been able to do that if you had gotten just one opinion.

The third and last reason is some people only want the best from you. When your parents give you advice it is not to be annoying but to help you with life, so you should probably go with what they are saying. When grandparents give you advice you would definitely want to take that into consideration because, going back to the first reason, they have been around for longer than you have.

That is why you should get advice from others. Some people have been on this earth longer, so you won't only get one opinion, and because some people want the best for you the next time that someone gives you advice you should take it into consideration and remember these reasons.
