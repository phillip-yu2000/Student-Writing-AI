In "The Challenge of Eploring Venus," the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. All throughout the artical the author gives lots of information on why we should study venus even with there being danger all throughout the planet. he talks about the dangers there could be, but the reward would be bigger in the long run if we explored venus. because of that he wishes to do so.

in paragraph 8 he states " Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the instigtht to be gained by itself, but also becuase human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally itimidating endeavores". he pretty much says that because of human curiosty it will happen with or without venus having dangers and he believes that we should do somthing before someone else does in the future. he believes even if there is high tempatures, radiation storms, and how 92% of the air is carbin dixoide which is all stated as dangers along with many other dangers of venus on paragraph 3. that we need to do more test and make more things to withstand veuns.

With all of these dangers it states in paragraph 7 "looking back to an old techonology called mechanical computers. these devices were fist envisioned in the 1800s and played an importan role in the 1940s world war ll" it wasnt actual computer, they didint exist in those days they were devices that made calculations by using gears and levers. the authour believes that is if somthing like that can survive world war ll than it should be made again to go down for testing and studying on venus.

all throughout the artical he has supported his claim very good on why we should study venus despite the dangers on venus. with loads of things of evedice all throughout this artical he talks about the dangers there could be, but the reward would be bigger in the long run if we explored venus.
