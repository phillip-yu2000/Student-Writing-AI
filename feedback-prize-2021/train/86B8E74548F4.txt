I agree because kids should be more physical and should get more excuise in, and the main reason i argee for the principal to make all the kids participate is because so they have some else to do in school other than work and sitting down all day . I think it will help kids get the understanding about sport and working on something, when they get older so what they meant to do and help people. my decision is that the principal should do that more because it will help kids be more better at thing like that so if they ever wanna play sport or anything they know that you have to participate in everything we do.

Activity are fun thing thing to do with people and at school cause it enoyable and fun to do, i really think the principal should do that at every school and the principal is right all kids can participate in sport or work is because it keep kids busy and it have kids doing some extra instead of all the kids sitting in the house or just doing nothing and i think it the right think to do is becuase they can get to express more thing in the world and kids can see more other just not doing nun but being in the house sleep and it will make kids understand life more. I hope that csn get kids in a better place when they grow up and they wanna do stuff on there wn wy amd i think it be nick to do some with them kids as a young as to do do physical sport or work somewhere but it be better to start young and contiune when they get older and stuff,

But the principal is help alot of kids to do think they wanna start trying to do when they get older and I feel like yes that be an great thing to do at a certain age and kids get be participateing in alot of stuff now days . I think it get better and better if kids do it and get use to it because alot of kids are not gonna wanna do nothig because they just wanna stay in the house and get on there phone and not gonna wanna do anything is it would be alot nicer if the principal help out the parent and tell the kids they can aleast particpate in a physical sort or work or do anything they would like to do but they gonna have to participate in somethin but not nothing and i think it be good. I would like to see kids do better in life and do better than what there parent was doing at a young age it would be a thing and something they could do and they can get there own car house and all that and if tha kids like that they prolly can go to college and go to school for that activity and prolly can be a teacher or a manger for whatever they like when they was doing as kids. And it kinda help me out cause it like i like to do physicla thing and like to help people work or anything they need help doing and it like i would like to do it and i seem like an awesome thing to do. And i feel like more thing should enter this world so kids can eneter more thing to do and get into more thing as like an 'Jobs , daycares , and help the community out i think that would be a great think to do the most impoortan thing is how i feel about it or what my decision is about the principal had decided for th kids to participate in school or outdoor activity i think yes the principal should because the kids will prolly learn more from it then just do anything and like in a school activity they could be in a yearbook club , track team ,cheerleader , or any type of sport they are happy or anything to do.

girl or boys can do anything wanna do any sport or more and i think they should wanna do sport cause it got stuff they like and like to do and it keep alot of kids busy to do and i would like to do that to cause i like to work and do sport so for me for myself i would be helpful thing to do . Like everyday kids should do some to help them be better it can be anything i could be running , walking help you family do stuff for the house go shopping do some other than sport and wanna play all day like the game or wanna fight and bully people i think it time just to help the community out and treat everybody as a family because it not alot of people and now days people wanna play sprt get a good and nice job and wanna do alot and i would like to do tracka and be a dancer cause that what i wanna do and my job i would like to do is be a lawyer and something that can help school and everything else , and if the principal would do that i would be a smart great thing to do in that school cause it teaching kids a lesson to do better in life and help kids out , that be a great idea to do . and if i was the princpal i would do the same thing to .
