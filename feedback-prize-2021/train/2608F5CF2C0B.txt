In the article Unmasking the face on Mars, people were debating if the face was made by natural causes or if it was made by aliens. Some people thought the aliens made a monument like the Egyptian used to. In the article it states "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." "A few days later NASA unveiled the picture for all to see. The captio noted huge rock formation which resembales a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The picture actually shows is the Martian equivlent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. So in the end the human face was not actually made by aliens making a monument it was made by natural causes. The human face remnds people most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.
