Dear Senator,

I argue in favor to changing the election by popular vote for the president. I aruge this because we aren't even really vote for a president, we are jsut voting for people who pick the president for what the passage says.

In what's wrong with the electoral college

, its says "voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. So this means we aren't even electing our own president, just people who do. which is not what everybody is thinking, everybody is thinking we are voting and we have that right and we have a say.

But in all reality do we really? We are just voting for people not the president and i think it should be changed. Then the passage goes on about if you vote for a certain people you've voted for a slate of how ever many people to vote for our president. Now to me that doesnt sound very right, it sounds like we are just voting for pretty much nothing. That we just get to vote for nothing and it doesn't even really matter what our vote is and they're going to pick who they want. I really thinkg it should be changed becuz reading this passage makes me kind of not even want to vote. Because i feel like its not helping any and i think that should be chamged and we shoukd have more of a right to vote for the president.

Senator, i dont think its a fair choose and it should be changed and so we can vote. People say its up to us be is it really, so i think it should be changed.
