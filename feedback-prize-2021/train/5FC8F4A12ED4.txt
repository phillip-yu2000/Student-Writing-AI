I Believe That the popular vote for the president of the united states is the best way to go by for voting. I read from the Story that The Electoral College system votes for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee,and the trust is rarely betrayed. Being that the electoral college group has the most The most best-laid defense it can also be wrong.

I Honestly think that you should conisder changing it to popular vote,i would consider what i read from the passage,That this year voter can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could agian lose the presidency. what i am trying to proove is that popular vote is the best choice for the presdiednt's votes.

Most worrying in the prospect pf a tie im the elcetoral vote,due to the election would be thrown to the house representives,where state delegations vote on the president. As also read in the story given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress,The house election can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. popular vote dosent has as much as problems or shall i say minor set backs as Electtoral College has.
