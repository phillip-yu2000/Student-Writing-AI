Dear principal,

I do not agree with having only B average students participating in sports and other activities. Since most students have a C average, it isn't fair to be having only B average students to participate in sports and activities. There are many different opinions that I have on this policy.

It is important to allow students to participate in other activities, not just for fun, but for health reasons too. As a growing kid, they would need to have exercise. I think it should be the parents decision to have their child play sports or not. I also think if students chose to participate in activities it could possibly help their education, the more they know the better it would be in any type of education.

Another reason I disagree is it would not make sense because there would most likely not be enough students to even participate and have full teams. That is not a good idea, because if no one can participate, that is not fair to the B average students. If most students have a C average instead of a B, you might need to work something out. A suggestion would be letting the kids with a C average participate, and below C average students could not.

A grade B is higher than average, so if you are expecting your students to get higher than a C that is expecting them to work on their abilities that they might not be able to fix. If students get a C average, they could be struggling, it does not necessarily mean they deserve to not be able to participate in sports and activities like other kids do. I believe that if this was made a new policy, it would be wrong and you should consider re-thinking another suggestion to change this.

I hope you will consider a new suggestion. Thank you for reading my opinion on the new policy you are considering.

From,
