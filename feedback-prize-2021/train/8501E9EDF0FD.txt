Dear TEACHER_NAME

i think that students should have to perform at least two hours of community service. i think that they can spare at least two hours and if they cant spare two hours one hour will be fine to help people that need help. if they needed that help then they would want someone to help them. it doesn't even have to be a hard job it can be picking up litter in you community or helping out kids that need a little extra help in school, or maybe helping out at the senior center or if you like animals then you can volunteer at the animal shelter because they need a lot of help and you will be helping the animals at the same time who knows maybe they will even like it a lot and volunteer there full time. if i had to give up two hours of my day to help someone then i would because i might like it i think that if we do, do community service then we should get something in return not something big but something. it would be a great change in the school. i think that if you made every kid in the school do community service that a lot of people would sign up and volunteer. plus if you get all your friends to do it then you and your friends can be spending time together but still helping out other people and having fun all at the same time. i think that everyone should try it because some people enjoy helping others and for the people that don't have the time i think that if they try this program then they will start to like it and they would have never known. you should try it and see what happens i bet you a lot of people would sign up. and who knows maybe you will too. thank you for reading this letter.
