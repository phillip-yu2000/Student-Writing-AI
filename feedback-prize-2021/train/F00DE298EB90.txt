In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars, and even though he had really good and valid reasonings for the positives, I still wouldn't think that driverless cars would be a good idea. Why, because anything could happen when a car is just being completely controlled by technology. Anything can have malfunctions, wether it's proved to have them or not.

For example, in the 7th paragraph, it states: "None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless." Meaning you would still have to have a human taking percautions at all times. Another thing I don't like, is how the cars alert the driver when it comes to traffic complications, because in paragraph 7 it also states: "They can't navigate their way out of traffic jams, roadworks or accidents." What if the car goes into a freak out mode and ends up having a mind of its own, because it won't know what to do, and starts driving automatically? Also, what if you get into a horrible car accident injuring yourself and many other people? Who would be put to blame here if the car is completely driverless?

These problems and questions I have with the "driverless cars" need to be taken very seriously into consideration.

Inconclusion, I will always prefer a human driving a car, because that to me is a lot more safer for the public, and a lot more safer knowing I am in control of my car.
