If you could buy a car that could drive you around, with you not having to do anything, would you buy it? Personally, I would not. There are to many things that could go wrong. We all know that technology can break down at times. Even our computers break down for no reason at times. So why let a car, that could end your life in a split second, drive you around? I wouldn't want to take that risk.

In the passage "Driverless Cars Are Coming," they explain that even at times the driver has to take over. They said, "the cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." What if, one time, the car did not notify the driver or the driver falls asleep? This could end the drivers life and someone else's. Yes, in the passage they state "the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." But, I know plenty of people, mostly teenagers, that would disconnect the wheel sensor. So again, why take this chance to end peoples life for some Driverless Car?

If we are going to have Driverless Cars then, they need to be a little safer before anyone can drive them. If we can't get our computers to work correctly sometimes, then why are we inventing Driverless Cars? If we keep working on Driverless Cars and they become safer, I will start to have an open mind. But again, anything could happen and cause a lot of people to get hurt. I would rather know I am fully incontrol of something, than not know.

Sometimes, inventing something new isn't always good. I think people are starting to become very lazy with all of the new technology today. We take these things for granted and then get hurt in the long run. So, I will stick to being against Driverless Cars because of everyones safety.
