The president is a serious job. Approve laws, representing our country, and he's very influential. So if it's such a big job, why not let the people of America choose their president? It's the right way to do things.

Americans fought the Revolutionary War to give us the right to choose our leaders, and if the Electoral College chooses the president, then we do not get much of the right that was fought for in the 1770's. If Americans don't get to choose the president that they want, then what's the point of voting? The answer is: there is no point, if the Electoral College votes the candidates instead.

The citizens of America chooses the Electors to represent their state. Then the Electors vote for the president. It seems simple, but what happens when the states are not properly represented, i. e. the electors do not vote for the candidate they were suppposed to? Why does the system still exist, but is majorly flawed? For one, it's confusing, two, it's a not practical, and three, it does not properly represent the states they are from.

Some might say that the Electoral College is an easier method to count the votes, maybe so, maybe not. It all depends on how the votes are counted. If they are counted by hand, then yes, it is a whole lot easier. If the polls are electronic, then there would be no difference, because the computer would do all the counting for you. It is also more efficient as to what the people really want rather than the Electoral College.

The Electoral College should be done away with, finished, no more. The American people need to vote to abolish the Electoral College, with no one voting for them this time. That way, the American people can finally be represented without any barriers interrupting them.
