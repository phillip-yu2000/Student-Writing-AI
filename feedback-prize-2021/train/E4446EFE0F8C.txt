Dear Principal,

There is not really even a choice because no matter what you choose kids are still going to bring there cell phones to school, but if i had the choice i would allow cell phones at school, one because no matter what kids are still going to bring there cell phones to school and two to connect with friends or family.

One reason you should allow cell phones at school is because no matter what kids are still going to bring them and use them during school. You should allow them because it will help you and the office out by patrolling the school for cell phone users, if you just allow them it will create a lot less stress on the teachers and the students. Then if you allow them in free times everybody is going to use them so you might as well allow them at school.

Another reason you should allow cell phones at school is because if you need to contact one of your friends or family. Say its a Friday afternoon and you want to ask your parents if you can go over to a friends house after school and you need to call your mom, perfect example why phones should be allowed in school because if you cant contact anyone then you cant go over to your friends house.

All in all, cell phones should be allowed in school because no matter what people will use them, and because if you need to contact your family or friends at school.
