Dear, Principal

My position on the subject is not to require all students to perform community service but only the students that choose to volunteer for community service . I say only the students that volunteer because when they do it their going to mean it and put lots of effort towards it. Also it would be after school so it would be coming out of our own time. Lets say you just got home from school and your tired and have lots of homework .Would more required work help you no our you wanted to study with friends you wont have time for it. But when its not required you can make time for it.

Also you should have a choice to put the subject out there as a extra project but not make it to require to students but their free time to do so. Because we spend 8 or more hours at school taking more out of day will effect or plans after school and putting more on our plates would just be wrong if it is force. All im saying is make it a extra not required assignment to the students so they can do it if they want to do community service

Sincerely,
