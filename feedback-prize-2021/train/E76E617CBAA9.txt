Schools are thinking about making a distance learning program. There are two positions which are schools should offer distance learning and that they should not offer distance learning. Schools should offer distance learning.

One reason is that it would limit outside distractions. One distraction that is taken away is the teacher being interrupted. An example is when there is constant knocking on the door.

Another reason is that it provides more options for home schooled students to get their education. One example is if the student needs to be home schooled but the parents cant get the license.

On the other hand, some people be leave that schools should not offer distance learning. They be leave this because it limits human interaction and prevents a sense of responsibility from forming.

However, this is not true because the students still get the human interaction they need and they still have the same work due at the same time.

In conclusion, schools are thinking thinking about making a distance learning program. One reason to offer a distance learning program is that it limits outside distractions. Another reason is that it provides more education options for home schooled children. However, some people think that school should not make a distance learning program because it limits human interaction and lessens the students sense of responsibility.
