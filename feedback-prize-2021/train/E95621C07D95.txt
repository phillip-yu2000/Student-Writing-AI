"When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."

This shouldn't be the way candidates win. The election should change, the candidates should earn their votes, win by popular vote.

If the process of voting changes to "win by popular votes" then at least the candidate would win fairly. If you think about it, wouldn't you want to win fair and square? don't you think you should earn your votes? or in general, if you think people should earn their votes then you should get an understanding of what is trying to be explained here.

I'm not the only one that thinks that the election should be by popular vote;

"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."

plenty of other people think we should vote directly instead of having the Electoral College system.

Nobody wants to vote for other people other than the one running for President, well at least 60 percent of the people don't.

The electoral college is unfair and it is why I think the election should count by popular vote. The electoral college is unfair because sometimes candidates don't a have chance to visit states so it's difficult to gain votes from those states the people who vote aren't really voting, it's the electors who are a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does (basically what I meant in reason 1)

The point here is, I think we should get rid of the Electoral College since it has been proven that it is unfair and just have a fair voting system from now on. Maybe put on a debate to see what people would prefer.
