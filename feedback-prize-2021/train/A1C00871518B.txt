Some students are offered distance learning from their schools. Students can work from home or video conferences with their instructors. Learning from home can make students miss out on opportunities they could have in school, like bettering their social skills and obtaining information needed for reality.

For example, learning from home makes students miss out on opportunities they could experience in school. Going to dances and making new friends. Missing out on the opportunities to see the fundamentals of school life. Learning from home limits students chances to use their social skills. Social skills that can prepare students for life. For example, getting a job. Therefore, students should attend school. Attending school gives students the benefit to make friends.

Another example, not being able to obtain the information needed for reality. There is a lot of information taught in classes. For example, the Fundamentals of Algebra or Reading. Information taught in these class courses are not all useless, but necessary. What is taught can help prepare students for a career dealing with that course. For example, being a biologist. The information taught in biology class can be of usage. Therefore, students should attend school rather than doing school from home.

Although, some might say that attending school from home is an appropriate option. Due to students feeling more safer at home or they have more independence at home. The purpose of school is for guiding students into being a greater mold of themselves. School helps you adapt to lifestyle. Without school, students will fail in life.

In conclusion, distance learning is used for students to learn at home. Which is not really beneficial to students. Students will miss out on opportunities of bettering their social skills and will lack the information taught in schools needed for career.
