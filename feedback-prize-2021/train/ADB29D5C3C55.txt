"Technology can be a good thingbor a bad thing depending how one uses it." Technology is made to facilitate life for us.

It would be a good idea to have driverless cars beause it could benifit us with so many things. For example,we wouldn't have to worry about a phsyco taxi driver abducting us in a busy and noisy city because,like the article says , we would have drivless cars who take us where we wish. Nevertheless,having a drivless car would really benifit us with money. The cars Sergin Brin forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexablity than the bus. "Yes,it will save us money but i would rather pay for my fuel than to risk my life with technology safty we're uncertain of."

People may be worried about the safety to,of course. The driveless cars will use sensors. Sensores are nothing new since automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within those 10 years sensors themself have became much more advanced. Further improvments in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving on their own.

Telsla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time ,mercedes-benz,audi and nissan plan to have cars that can drive themsekves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us,but we grow closer to the destination every day.
