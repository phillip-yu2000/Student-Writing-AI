I am for driverless cars, I believe they are the true future of vehicles. I think that cars where people still actually drive them will be used as entertainment than actual means of transportation. Traffic laws will of course have to be made for the driverless cars as time goes by, but I think that once they are fully driverless there will be little to no driving laws as the cars will be advanced enough to not have to worry about them. Cars may not be fully driverless in our lifetime, but I believe that eventually it will happen.

Traffic laws for vehicles will be added and removed as the advancement of driverless cars continue. I think that there will be motion sensors or a sync that will detect when a car is coming to a stop sign or a stop light and will make it stop on its own. All the basic driving laws of today will either be altered or removed more than likely.

Cars that are still required to have an actual person control them will be used more as entertainment purposes than for actual transportation. It will be like sporting events such as NASCAR and Formula 1 racing I would say. They will not be used for actual transportation though.

Cars will not be fully driverless in our lifetime, I believe. We will be very close to achieving it, however. I think that they will still be semi-driverless by then.
