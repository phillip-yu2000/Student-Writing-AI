It makes sense that people think this is evidence of an ancient civilization, but according to NASA they wish it was. Nowadays, with science fiction rapidly advancing it's hard to not imagine or want aliens and any sort of other life to exist because of how extraordinary it would be. Up until today NASA hasn't found any life out there, but they want to and all the other science enthusiasts do aswell. If this was a clue to other life out there, just stumbling upon this was way too easy. Obviously, others like this have been found, meaning this isn't anything more special than a natural landform. If aliens really did exist there is a small chance NASA would just easily stumble upon evidence like this one because if this was real it's too good to be true.

Realistically, there's so much reasoning from the experts themselves proving that this isn't anything unusual. First of all there's a thing called shadows and they can easily turn a natural figure into looking like some human-like structure. NASA will literally use technology we don't have access to such as more high-tech cameras to find out things no one ever knew existed. Obviously there are landforms like a butte or mesa meaning this isn't something never found. In fact there's one in Idaho called the,"Snake River Plain of Idaho".

When just ordinary people just make an inference it doesn't mean it's true. When thinking about who finds out all the things and goes up to see the things that occur in space it's NASA. Honestly they are the smarter ones, so there's nothing some regular people with opinions can prove. When the picture was shown it shows the landform started to change or deform, meaning if the structure is able to do such a thing looking like a face had no purpose. If it these are signs of an ancient civilization wouldn't there be more evidence discovered by now or wouldn't there be more of these near?
