'Umasking the face on mars' well at NASA we are discussing the face with someone wo thinks it was created by aliens. I would have to disagree to that. My arguement would be that it is just a natural landform.

Why do i say it is just a natural landform well because aliens arent real. Also in 1976 you could barely tell it would happen to look like a face way after 2001. If aleins would have created that then when they first created it then why did it not look like a face then? It's just a natural landform that was formed into a face.

In 1976 it just looks like lump on the ground and in 1998 you cant even see where the eyes nose and mouth would be and if they would of created it then surely they would of made it more noticeble. In 2001 it looks like a turtle shell , it has cracks in it and is shap almost like an oval but not excatly and i say an oval because there is no sharp edges. The reason i am explaining the shape and apperacance is because if someone were to creat a face it would take years to form out into one. Later on in the years it doesn look like a face but im gonna disagree on it wasnt created by aleins it is just a natrual landform.

That was my argument on aleins did not creat the face that it is just a natrual landform. It formed into looking like a face but didnt right when someone first saw it so there for how could any know it was suppose to be a face like i said. It just shaped into one over the years. Then people wanna make an opinion that is on aleins creating it. I think it is just a natural landform.
