My opinion on this whold driverless car deal is that it's not a terrible idea. I just don't see to much to offer besides a car that is just a waste of time on the road for everyone else. They have to test the car to be better and I understand that it's just that maybe we're not ready for cars like this so soon. As time goes on humans are more dependant on technology and we can't do that forever sometimes it's good for us to not rely on it so much. With cars we drive ourselves around and are alwayed focused on the road and what's around us at all times we become more alert in a way. Now with self driving cars we sort of loose that awareness of being alert all the time while on the road.

This idea is another great idea to keep the crash records down but it doesn't change the fact that humans almost everyday depend on everything to do something for us no matter how simple it is. Humans are getting lazier and lazier by every new invetion that is being produced. Sometimes it's bad sometimes it's good but in this case it's kind of a bad thing because it's another thing that a "thing" can do for us.

Untill they can find a way that this will truly work I will be against it.
