In the world, there are people who believe in aliens or supernatural beings, while some do not. The face on Mars is an example of an occurance that causes people to believe in aliens or supernatural beings. Even though this is true, there are still many people who think the landform is a natural occurance. There are ways to prove that this theory for the landform is true. Reasons such as the landform being compared to natural, earth landforms and it has similar characteristics as earth lanforms help prove this is true.

The landform was compared to a butte or a messa. This means it is quite similar to earthly landforms and may have occured due to something that happened on Mars. The face on Mars is comapared one main earth landform that was mentioned. The landform is Middle Butte, which is located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It was a lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa.

The face on Mars had the same look and height as a Earth landform, a mesa. It is true that there is an unusual shape to the face on Mars, there are similar occurances that happen on Earth. Though this happens on Earth, people don't say that these Earth landforms were made by aliens.

This landform is just like other occurances on seperate planets that resemble Earth landforms. Even though the landform resembles a human face, it doesn't mean the landform is an alien's doing. Just like landforms on Earth, there are more ways than one to prove the reason or the starting place of a landform.
