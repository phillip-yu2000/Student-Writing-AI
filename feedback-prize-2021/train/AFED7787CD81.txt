Make a difference in your community with the people you enjoy being with. Some of your friends perform community service in tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. Your principal is deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. Making a difference in your community won't take your time in fact it will help your community.

As a result many of your friends think if they take a second to clean after them self's there weird because others may not clean up after them self's so they don't. Go to parks, schools, student centers, and around their neighborhoods. Yourself and friends could make a difference.

For example if your friends are clean not only will it make a difference in their surroundings but at their home, parents would love to see their children room clean without reminding them for the 100 time.

Community service benefits everyone.

In addiction they don't have to do community service alone, a friend, family member could go alone with them and make it fun. Sure cleaning doesn't sound like a great idea but it will make a big difference. Community service wont take up your time .

Community service benefits everyone in many ways. The principal should make everyone participate in this activity.
