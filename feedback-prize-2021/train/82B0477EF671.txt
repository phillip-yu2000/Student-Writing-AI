The author is answering rather or not if humans going to Venus is worth the dangers it presents. The author thinks that yes, we should go to Venus because it will meet the very edges of are imaginations, curiosity, and we are making machines that will last longer on Venus.

The first reason the author gave us on why we should land on Venus is that it will meet the very edges of are imaginations. What the other means by this is thed human body is always thinking about what is out there in space. By putting humans on Venus this can give us an answer to are imangination and maybe make us think even more about what is out there.

Not only does the author say it will meet the very edges of are imaginations he also says "Striving to meet the challenge presented by it will meet the very edges of are imaginationsenus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity. What the author means by this is he is showing that we are never not wondering. We will always be wanting to do something that will answer a question that we have. For example, "i wonder what this book is about". what you would do is read the book. Just like how we wonder what Venus is like. We want to land on it.

The last reason the author gave to us is that NASA is making more machines to be able to handle the weather on Venus. In the text it says "Many researchers are work on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus". By the author saying this hes menaing that sinse we have more machines that can make it to Venus we can now learn more about to be able to send humans to that planet.

So by the author giving us all these reasonf he thinks that yes, we should go to Venus because it will meet the very edges of are imaginations, curiosity, and we are making machines that will last longer on Venus.
