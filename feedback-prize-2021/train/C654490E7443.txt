Dear State Senator,

Have you ever sent your vote to where its is in the hands of other people not knowing what is going to happen to it like is it going to be counted for the person you want it to, or it could be for the person you really do not want to win. Well that is called an electoral college. It in my opinion is not a very good system because, you don't always get to vote for who you want to.

I believe that we as individuals have the right to choose what we want in a leader. I do not believe Electoral College. For the simple fact, we do not always get to vote for who we want to run our country. The people of America have their own beliefs and own opinion and when it comes down to where we have to choose the person who will be running our country for four consecutive years we will vote for the one we believe that will not hurt our beautiful country. But if we did choose the Electoral College and I wanted to vote for John McCain for instance, and is sent it in and now your vote is in the hands of other people now you don't know if your vote is gonna be for John McCain or Barak Obama. Therefore I do not like or consider anyone using the Electoral Collage.

By using the popular vote you are guaranteed the vote you wanted. You don't have to worry if you vote got changed or not. You popular vote is what you wanted to choose and no one could change that

So I think I speak for the people when I say lets do away with the Electoral College and just use the popular votes.

-Thank You
