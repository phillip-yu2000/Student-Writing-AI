Dear principal,

I

think that we should be able to choose whether we do/don't want to commit time to auxiliary others. I think this because some people may or may not have after school activities and or family matters to attend to, but others might be willing to do so. Others including myself might not have sports or family matters ,but we might prefer to have fun and hangout with our friends. Even though this may seem selfish i think if at all we have to be forced to volunteer to build character or some other reason we should do this during school hours that way other activities that are after school do not interfere with it. So it is with all of my and the other students might we ask please do not force us volunteer when the meaning of volunteer is to give an effort toward another willingly and not unwillingly and if so please allow it to be during and not after school hours.

yours truly,
