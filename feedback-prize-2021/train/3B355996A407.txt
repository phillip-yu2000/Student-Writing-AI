Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break should these projects be teachers designed or students designed?.

I'm taking pocition of this topic, In my opinion students should be have their own projects during the summer, the students already knows, whats the problem is or what they have it trouble with. students involved in summer projects, could be one way to students can learned also students can have more skills if they keep practice with their own projects and ideas they are going to be ready when they coming back to school , I'm totally agree with that the students should be designed their projects,For example, I'm a student of ESL, I like to make my on projects during summer to dot not forgot what

I already learned during the year, in others words students need to work in their on projects during their break

The firs reason about this topic, some students, who feel more comfortable making their on projects is that they will know how the topic goes, because they were the ones who created. in fact, If schools let students to make their own projects , they will be more comfortable because they will know what the topic is about and it will be easy for them to make it.

Second reason, students needs to make their own projects during summer could be more help for the students , when they came back to schools, because they are not going to forgot it, what they already learned,the students don't have to stop working their own projects because if they stop probably they become lazy. for example ESL students, if they don't try to make their own projects they will be forgot everything.

I think that the students, needs to have their own projects during summer, that would be a good for students,

also , students,

won't forget everything that already leard during the year, because they are still working on their own projects and understanding better their projects, I'm totally agree with that the students, can do better without teacher during summer, students can be more active and show more their abilities, if they try they will make it. there are many points to students make their own projects during summer.
