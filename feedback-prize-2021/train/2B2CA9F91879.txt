I think that this new technology can be valuable in many different ways. It can help teachers know why a student is acting different. It can also help teachers know why the kid is not turning in his homework. If the kid is getting in to trouble fighting in school teachers can use this to know why he is doing this to see wat is wrong or how he feels.

If a student is acting different in class teachers can use this new technology to identify his emotions and see why he is acting different. That way teachers can know why and maybe have a little talk with him. So that he stops acting the way he is n stop being disrespetful.

This new technology can also help the teachers know why this kid is not turning in his work. He may not turn in his work because he is sad or is not feeling good if teachers know this then they can talk to the kid and help him start turning his work in so that he can pass his classes and graduate.

If a student is getting into trouble, fighting , talking bad to teachers. The principles can use this knew technology to know why he is doing this or how he is felling maybe there is stuff going on at home and he is felling sad and angry at the same time. If teachers know then they can help this kid out and start to meke the kid make good choices.

Well this is why i think the use of this technology is valuable. hoefully we will have this someday i think that it will be really helpful and usefull for teachers i think they will use it a lot to find out how students are feeling or their emotions.
