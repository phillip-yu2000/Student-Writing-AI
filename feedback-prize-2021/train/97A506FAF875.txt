"How could you think it is created by aliens, it is obviously just a natural landform," I said. PROPER_NAME said "But how could it be natural, the odds of that happening are like one in a million." "JPL already has proof that it is just natural, they said it was a butte or mesa, landforms common around American West, besides, do you truly think there are little green guys with really big foreheads and wierd eyes just walking around mars. I mean I don't want to sound mean, but if you truly think that, then there is something going on in your head that isn't quite healthy," I said. PROPER_NAME came back with,"How could you be so selfish to say that everthing on earth are the only living things in the universe, and by the way, there isn't anything wrong with me in the head, there might be with you if you are that selfish. I thought youre Mother raised you right." I argued, "There is no way any life form could have a face two miles from end to end, that is just obserd. Plus, if you think that there is just some hidden life form out there surviving and making places to live, than how do you sleep at night.'' "I sleep just fine at night thank you very much. And yes, I do think there could be something like that out there, and it is not obserd or..." I interfered,"I just can't believe you would think this ignorantly, I have known you for fifteen years,and you are the smartest human being I know." "if there is life on Mars and you don't believe me, you will be sorry you ever spoke to me."
