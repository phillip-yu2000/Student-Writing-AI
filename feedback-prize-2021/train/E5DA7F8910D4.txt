Do you belive the image of the face on Mars was created by aliens, or is just a natural landform? Well I belive it is just a natural landform.

Its obvius that cameras back in 1976 werent as sharp or as modern as they are today. Evidence from the passage show that in Sept 1997, NASA went to take a photo of the alleged face on Mars." On April 5th, 1998, when MGs flew over Cydonia, Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original viking photos."

Not everyone agreed with the picture that was tooken. Because the photo was tooken in April'98, which was a cloudy time of year for Mars, people suggested alien markings were hidden by haze. Though this theory makes sense ,Mission controllers prepared to look again.

On april 8th, 2001, a cloudless summer day on the red planet in Cydonia, MGS drew a close enough for a second look.

Malin's team captured a excellent image using the cameras maximum resolution. A pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters in the best 1976 viking photo. This means that the camera used is much more sharp and see's further than the previous camera. This evidence is the reason I believe there is no camera flaw and is just a natural landform.

Also the picture in april of 2001 shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, in other words common landforms around the American west.

With this evidence there is no way there could have been a mistake in the picture. Also there could be no theory because the picture was tookin on a cloudless summer day.
