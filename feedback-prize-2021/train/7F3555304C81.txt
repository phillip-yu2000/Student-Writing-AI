Dear ,Mr. senator

I'm writting  this letter to you in the favor of not keeping the electoral college . It take the right of the people away ,we dont get to choose who we want as  president because  if we dont get a say then the congress chooses for us and that might just create some dissagrements between the peopleand the goverment  . In the text it states that the voters don't control who they elect for that kinds of violate our rights as the voters .The text also states that the systems allow for much worse to happen than what happened in 2000 the legeslators are respionsible gfor it and it said that those elctors can also defi the the rights of our people in that case it will all be thronw to the house of representative the electoral college is unfair and irrational althought one might say thast it keeps us from getting to much chaos it actually does'nt becasuse if the people think that your taking there rights aways them wil go against you like nobodies bussiness. Thank you for your time, PROPER_NAME
