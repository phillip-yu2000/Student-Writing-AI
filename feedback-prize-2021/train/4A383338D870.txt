The Seagoing Cowboys program is a very beneficial group. I am Luke Bomberger, and

I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is a job opportunity to help take care of animals that are shipped off to other countries that were left in ruins. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, I helped others, took care of animals, and got to go to places all over the world.

The Seagoing Cowboy program has people taking care of animals such as horses young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. When I worked overseas as a Seagoing Cowboy, I served as a watchman on my second trip. On the boat, I checked the animals every hour, and I cracked my ribs. Even though I got hurt, it was a good experience to work on a boat with animals. Along with helping others, you get to see many other esqusite places. I got to see parts of Europe and China, but the most special place I got to see was the Acropolis in Greece. It was also special when I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. And these are just a few of the amazing places I've visited! Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a lot of work, but it sure is a lot of fun, seeing and learning things from all over the world.

How did I become a Seagoing Cowboy, you asked? Well, my friend Don Reist invited me to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe, and I couldn't say no. It was an opportunity of a lifetime. In Europe, we heard about the UNRRA hiring people to take care of the livestock that was to be shipped to other countries. Don and I signed up. This decision changed my life forever. After I signed up, I got to do many things. That is my story of becomoing a Seagoing Cowboy, and now it's your turn to become one.

Now that you all know about my experience, come and see for yourself how great it is to be a Seagoing Cowboy. There are lots of fun things to do, and lots to learn! Have an adventurous time being a Seagoing Cowboy!
