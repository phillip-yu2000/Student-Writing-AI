Many people think that this is a alien formed face noooo. I claim that this is a natural landform. We have taken many pictures and it has faded away more every time we take a picture of it. There are some many reasons of how this face was a natural landform.

First, This natrual landform was not form by alein becuase in the pictures you see a small mountain or big hill , but here in the USA, there are many of thoes big hills or small mountains. They are mostly around the American west. It is a lava dome that are on the USA too. and they are the same height. So that face on that hill is not alone.

Next, Another reason on how that natrual landform is natural not made by aliens is that every time we take a picture over the years the face is always fadeding away so if an alien created it why would he just leave it there just to faded away.

They would of kept it alive.

Last, I can see on how somebody could think this was formed by an alien but how do you explain that the eyes are just shadows. They are formed from the nearby rock. Plus the mouth and nose are also formed by the nearby rock shadow. So the mouth, nose and eyes are not really even there they are just shadows

In conclusion, I am telling the alien face that was on mars was just a lava dome. And its eyes nose mouth were just shadows. Plus the picture just started fading away through the years. This is how the Face was not made by aleins but was a natural landform
