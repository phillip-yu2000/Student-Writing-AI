School is a place where you learn about many topics. Having an extracurricular activity after school is very important. They can benefit you in many ways. There are many types of extra activities.

Extracurricular activities are very important, because they give you a chance to learn about a broader variety of topics. In high school, most activities will give you one credit towards your degree. This is important because your degree is what decides weather or not you can get a good job. After school classes can also be fun. If one is doing an interesting activity after school, that could be fun and it can be something one can look forward too. Depending on the school, there will be a wide variety of extra things to do after your day is over. With that being said, there must be something that is fun or interesting.

Most students will blow off after school activities because they know that they don't need to engage in them. If students must participate, than they would not be able to ignore them. Now even though this would not be every day, it would still be very beneficial to do extracurricular activities. Some students do multiple after school classes a week, but this can be stressful at times. That is why one activity is enough to start. Most children that participate in these are more successful in school. Extra classes is also a way to make new friends. Every principle should have every student do an extra activity after or during school.

This is why I think that every student should engage in an extra activity after school. Having an extracurricular activity after school is very important. They can benefit you in many ways. There are many types of extra activities. Your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.
