Dear Principal,

I believe that the first policy will be a good choice for the cell phone issue because student may have to contact family member or their parents through out the day. If there was an emergency with some one an they need to know about it they should be able to do so at lunch or any other free time they might have. The student might have to figure out where they have to go after school or if there parents want them home. Student should be able to use there cell phone when they have breaks, and when they are in class have to turn them off. I think that the students wouldn't be using there cell phones in class as much if they would get to use them at lunch or breaks. I also think that allowing student to use their cell phones during breaks will let them maybe check up on thing that are going on at home, or let them know if their parents are planning on picking them up early. I think this would be a better policy for the school then the second policy.

Sincerely,
