You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program with me. Its many countries that need to recover from World War 2. We will take care of animals that will be shipped overseas. All you have to do is sign up it will be a opportunity of a lifetime. You will be able to travel to diffrent places for the Seagoing Cowboys Program.

First, there's countries that need food supplies and more. After the World War two some countries began to go poor, so 44 nations joined together and created the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaition Administration. They hired us (Seagoing Cowboys) to take care of animals such as cows,horses, and mules that were shipped. After the Pacific war we got seaman's papers and went to Greece with 335 horses and had enough food for them.

Second, this is a huge opportunity for your life. If you haven't traveled to a diffrent country before you will. You will be able to take care of people and also go places you never been before like Europe and China, trust me you will be excited. Another cool thing is that you will be able to be watchmen and check the animals on the boat every hour.

Third, some bad things about it is that it will take you weeks to go visit the other places you go to. It took me a month to reach China. You need to be prepared for the hard work you do. If you are the watchmen you have to be carefull not so slip on the ladder on a rainy day.

Last, its good and bad things about being a Seagoing Cowboy but mostly good things. When you returned after a trip overseas you can play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds. We play games such as Table- tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,and other fun games. It can also show you how you should be thankful because people in diffrent countries don't have what you have. Now would you agree with me that you should sign up in the Seagoing Cowboys?
