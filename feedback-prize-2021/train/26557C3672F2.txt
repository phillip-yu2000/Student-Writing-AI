Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a middle school student, I believe that policy 1 is perfectly efficient and makes more sense. Kids need their phones for obvious reasons; who will pick them up, what do they do after school. Their phones help them connect with their parents or guardians.

I'm a student, and I own a cell phone. The only time I need to use my cell phone is after school waiting to get picked up. Every now and again I will need to call my mom during class, but I always ask first. Most kids don't even bring phones at all. A few text during class, though it doesn't last long. But banning phones altogether is unrealistic, and unreasonable. Some kids rely on them to get home. If something happens, contact with parents is essential.

If phones were banned altogether, I think many kids would lose lots of freedom. Parents trust their kids more if they have a way to get in contact with them. Without their phone, kids could be left at school, locked out of the house, or stuck somewhere off campus, and parents have no idea where they are. If someone goes somewhere after school with friends, parents feel more comfortable if their kid has a phone, and if they don't the student may be kept at home by parents. In other words the ban of phones could cut into social life, and reducing stress.

What is the harm in policy 1? I see it that there is no harm done. The students can't disrupt class by using phones during class, so what's the problem? They can call parents or guardians at opportune times like lunch and other breaks. This lets them stay in contact with home, keep parents more comfortable, and keep classes in order with no electronic cell phone disruption.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
