Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think Policy 1 as in allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time ,as long the phones are turned off during class time .

It would add more success to the board of education rate in learning wise because it would show itselfs to students that it's a time and place for everything .Also it would settle less problems during lunch periods such as bad behavior. I think that it would add more success to board of education rate in learning wise because students in the new learning envoroment think we only have to do school more and we never have no free time because the hours of periods take up our free time at home to have fun because we have to homework and study to do for 10 months staraight everyday, except the weekend so if you let us as in students have some free time periods and school work periods seperated and even , it will be a better understanding to students that it a time and place for everything. Also it would settle bad behavior tone down because when students have free time all they can do is talk and talking gets boring after a while. So the students will try to make that free time fun and throw pencils or food all over the classroom or lunchroom. So I hope this piece of writing help change your decision.

Love,

STUDENT_NAME
