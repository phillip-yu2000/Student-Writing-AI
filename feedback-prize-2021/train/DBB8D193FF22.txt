One day I am going to school and when I got there I hear my principal say all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Why do we have to participate in at least one activity. I disagree with what my principal said, because some students can't participate. The students can't participate is, because there mom and dad might not want them to be doing sport.

Recently studies have shown were people are getting hurt by play a sport. I dont think that would be a good idea on the principal part, because she would have a lot of her students at her school hurt and can do stuff. If more students were getting hurt form extracurricular activity that she was making all the students do. She would not have a job that long, because the kids mom and dad could go to the school board and come plane.

Some of the kids has a job and don't have time to play in sport. If the school payed you money to play then the people would not work at there job, but they don't. Why should we have to play a sport if we don't want to? Well you should not have to play a sport if you don't want to. When ever you do something you are going to get made fun of, and I don't know about you, but I would not like that.

Studies have also some that when you are doing a extracurricular activity, that it can make your life harder. You would have to help after school with is more work on top of the work you have to do for school. Why should the principal decided that all student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity when studies have shown that is not a good idea for people to participate.

So studies have shown that it's not a good idea to participate. When there are activity that come open I would not go to it, because it's going to make your life hard then it's already. This is why I disagree with what the principal said the all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.
