Have you ever thought about purchasing a driverless car? Well In this passage it states that there is some bad flaws to having one. Like in 2013 BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant. The driverless car that can handle drving functions at only speeds up to 25 mph. But the google car, only tells the driver when they still have to steer the vehicle in some many ways these cars are not safe to be released to the public. Because if they do more laws will have to be made and will cost money. Also that will take some time to be passed. Like even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone were to be injured then who`s at fault the person who drove the car or the manfacuture. So in this case The author made sense of it being a negative aspect. I believe there may be one day there might be a driverless car in the 8th paragraph but maybe passed 2020. So in conclusion the author stated hard facts that prove right now in this present there not safe for us to drive in, but maybe in the near future they will be safe enough to drive passed 25 mph, also work sites or work zones and or other accidents the car will be able to adknowlege a accident to prevent another one. Also the cost of these cars will sky rocket to only the high end rich people will be the ones purchasing one. High end computers already cost over 30 thousand dollars, thinking about a car theat drives for you will be in an anmassive price range. Another thing is what would happen if one of these cars got into an accident to think how much damage to them? Would it do and how much will it cost to replace a car that will barley come out. Would they also have to make changes to the roads to make them drive or will they know exactly where to go?
