Have you ever done an extracurricular activity? Did you like it? My principal has decided that everyone must take part in an extracurricular activity. I disagree with his decision because some students may not have time, no one to take them, or not enough money.

Students may not have enough time to do everything they need to do and go somewhere. Sometimes they have to finish their studying, homework, and go to a game or practice. They could also have a job or have to help out on a farm. For example, I had so much homework and studying to do, but I could not get it all done and go to practice. As a result I stayed home and did my homework and studying instead of going to practice. Because I did not have enough time, I could not do an extracurricular activity.

Some students do not have someone to take them to games and practices. Their parents may not be able to take them because they work late or they have to go somewhere after work. One time my mom had to work late but, I also had cheer practice. Because I had no one to take me to practice, I had to stay home and miss a practice.

Some times students can not participate because their families do not have enough money. Their parents need money so they can take them to and from places; also, they have to pay to get in games and for insurance. One time I wanted to do dance, but I could not do it because we did not have enough money. Because we did not have enough money to pay for it, I was not able to do an extracurricular activity.

My principal recently decided that every student must do an activity. I do not agree with this because students may not have time, no one to take them, or enough money. I think his decision is not completely thought out.
