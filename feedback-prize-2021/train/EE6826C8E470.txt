I don't think that we should have to do community service. I think that the people that do should be able to get rewards or something. Cause sometimes some people cant they might be busy or they don't feel good or stuff like that. That is my opinion, but the people that do should get things. maybe things for school or stuff for sports or anything.

We could even have it where like every hour you do you get something and when you get so many of them you could turn them in for something else. Or once a month or however often, one ticket from each person gets put in a drawing and if there name gets drawn then they get a big prize.

It could be like a club for the school. Where kids meet up after school or before school and go and do things for the community. To make it look nice or even tutoring little kids anything helps and they would no that they are doing the right thing.
