Most kids find school very boring, espesically because you wake up early almost every day and go to this place where you use your brain all day. Using this new technology I think would help schools out a lot because it would help them understand what a student is thinking everyday at school. In the article it states "most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait" this system could see through your expressions and right to what you're thinking.

This new technology would be very intresting to have in a classroom just so the teachers could know what you are thinking emotionally. I can kind of see where this could be interupting your privacy but sometimes a teacher should know if your having a hard time or if your even bored in class. Knowing your getting bored in there class would make me as a teacher want to try something differently. Just by reading this article the machine sounds kind of cool it can read what your emotions are just by scanning your face, thats crazy.

Finally after my opinion this machine hopefully you agree with me on this because some schools might wanna try it out. Some teachers need to know what there students are thinking and you know 90 percent are probably going to be bored. So now it is up to the teachers to make it less boring because they know now that your not interested in what they're teaching. Therefore, I think schools need this technolgy in classrooms because it could benifit the teachers in many ways.
