Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you are deciding between two policies on the inhabitance of cell phones at school. I am writing this to state my opinion on this, and greatly suggest that I am all for Policy 1. I do feel that cell phones should be allowed to be of use in free time. Emergencies might happen, or maybe they forgot something and need to call home. I think it is necessary for a student in case of things.

First off, emergencies might or could happen. Whether it's some bleeding in the lower area of a female to a severe injury or sickness, cell phones would be useful to call a parent to tell them that they are not doing well. Students might even use their phones just to talk to other people in the school, but they should still acquire one just in case. Besides, it decreases the school's phones bill and teaches students responsibility to care for their own things.

Of course, things can get out of hand, since the phone is a way of communication. Bad things about one another can be said and can start confrontations or fights. But that is why there is suspension and discipline for that sort of thing. There are rebels out there, and whether you ban phones or not, they will most likely continue to have them in their possession.

These are just some of my reasons of having Policy 1. It's good incase of emergencies and for sickness and even for just pure fun. I really hope you consider my reasons and maybe select Policy 1. Well, that is all I have to say. See you at school again tomorrow!

Your student,
