Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I heard that you were deciding whether to require all students to perform community service.

Everyone has their different opinion on community service. Some people think that community service is very important, while others feel that it takes up too much of their time, based on what I have heard from my friends.

My suggestion is that I feel as if community service should be a requirement. Although some students find it a waste of time, it would be good to have everybody helping out their community. I feel that if the students are required to do community service, they might end up enjoying it and changing their views on it. Chances are they might end up feeling good about themselves after doing a good deed for their community. Plus, there are many different ways to serve community service. I think that the students that feel as if its a waste of time might find something they can do to help out their community and enjoy at the same time.

I think it would be great to have everybody helping out with their community and making it a better place.

Please take some time to think over my suggestion.

Thank you for your time,

STUDENT_NAME
