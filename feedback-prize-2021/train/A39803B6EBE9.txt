Have you ever needed advice about something or someone? Whether to do this or do that, or maybe you want to go on vacation somewhere and you dont know what to do there? This maybe how you and other people feel when needing something so the solution to our problem is asking for someones advice or there opinion on that topic. Some advice is not always relevant or some people may have forgot to say something they like about a trip so getting many opinions is always good too. When asking for advice people may ask for different opinions because you get a different viewpoint of the situation, different people that you ask may have different opinions of the topic, and some people you ask may not be relevant to the conversation and dont know what they are talking about.

Finding a different view of the situation may help you in the long run. Although someone may not know what they are talking about. You never know if the person you are talking to is making valid comments or just starting a rumor. The person you are talking to may dislike someone that you need advice of so they might start a rumor. Rumors spread really quick so you might believe them. Getting advice from many people might solve your mystery to who is telling the truth.

When getting advice there is always more than one opinion and they are always all different. You may be in an amusement park and you dont know witch ride to go on so you may ask other people which ride to go on. Getting different opinions will tell you witch ride is better and getting many opinions will tell you witch ride to go on.

In conclusion when asking for advice people may ask for different opinions because you get a different viewpoint of the situation, different people that you ask may have different opinions of the topic, and some people you ask may not be relevant to the conversation and dont know what they are talking about.Â
