Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students should have to do community service for discipline reasons only. Most student should want to help our community and help keep it organized and clean. 95% of the student would love to do community service but, 16% wouldn't enjoy doing community service either, because they have other things to do like go to the mall or go to friends houses or they just feel that community service is for only nerd's or losers. Well i think that 16% of our school should be the ones helping our community every Mondays and Wednesdays and also on weekends. Other wise the rest of our students love to do community service they love to help out with things that are needed. For those 16% i really believe they should go out and do community service for discipline reasons like say if your walking down the hallway and you see a student disrespecting one of the teachers all you have to do is walk into that room and say you have community service this amount of days or weeks. Once you've told the student their parents will get called and inform them about what their child has community service for doing that was out of line toward someone else. So say if you catch a student writing in school property that student will automatically have community service for 2 months or however many days weeks or months you deicide to give that student. Well thanks TEACHER_NAME for your support and hope to hear from you soon thanks.

Sincerely ,STUDENT_NAME
