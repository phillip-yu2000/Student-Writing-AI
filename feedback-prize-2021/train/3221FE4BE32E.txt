My position on the driverless cars is positive. In todays time driving has become a nesesaty. You have to drive to get around anywhere. Acceddents happen and accidents will still happen its not the car its the perso whom is driving. Sould you be hadycapped or sck,or having issues with your sight. The Driverless Cars are a more safe and enviromental transportation system. Think about it it would be more safe for everyone. In the passage it states that they are so safe that their cars have driven half a million miles without a single crash or accident.

in the driverless car it has a rotation mirrorsensor int he roof. avideo camera mounted near the rearview mirror,four automotive radar sensors,a GPS reciever,andan intertail motion sensor all of wich in a regular simple car these delecasies for safty are not nearly mimicated. Now those sensors can respond to out of controlskids or rollovers. the information from the sensors can make the car apply brakes if they are needed o stop. It can also reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response ad control that a ¨huma driver¨ could manage on his own.

I quote the passege ¨while the driver watches the road the car watches the driver¨.
