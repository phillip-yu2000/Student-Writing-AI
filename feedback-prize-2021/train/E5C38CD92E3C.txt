Should there be schools that require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break? I believe that school officials should not make summer projects teacher-designed. I agree that summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed.

If students were to be forced to do a teacher-designed project, it would cause a sense of unfairness. I think this because, students are still having to do school work even during their summer break. During the summer, a lot of students may have jobs that requires them to work long hours or other duties. So they may not not have the time to do a teacher-designed project. However, others may simply just want to relax their minds from all of the end of year tests. Therefore, it would be fair to have students just complete student-designed projects. This way it will be a little more easier on those who have summer duties or jobs. Also, this would help students learn to be more creative;rather than just having them learn about one subject. In a way, this would be a far better option than having them do a teacher-designed project.

In conclusion, I disagree that students should do teacher-designed projects instead of student-designed ones.
