Dear Principle,

I believe that everyone should be required to do community service.

The people of the school need to realize that if you do the community service it not only helps you but also the people around you.

If you were to do some community service it would be good to put on your college and/or job applications.

Just because you are not being payed to do it, doesn't mean that you can't do it. I believe that if a student decides not to do it they should be punished.

You don't have to do anything be and special, you could just start off by helping people take their groceries to their vehicle.

Maybe after they start off with the little things they will realize how much it really does help the people around them.

Once they start to get the hang of it they might actually help more often rater than only doing it when someone forces you.

Maybe if they start off at a young age they will do it more throughout their life.

You would think that younger people would have more energy to do more things, rather than older people.
