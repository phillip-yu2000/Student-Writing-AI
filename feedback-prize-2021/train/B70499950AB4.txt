In the passage "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author believes that studying Venus is very viable despite how dangerous the planet is. The author, however shows many reasons to support this belief.

The main reason why it is so difficult for us to explore Venus now is that the planet has an atmosphere made up of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide, meaning that for humans and machines alike this planet is uninhabitable. There is also the fact that Venus is the hottest recorded planet, and that mere metals would turn to liquid being on there. Even with these challenges, astronomers still believe they need to explore Venus, as it's structure is very similar to Earth; meaning that it may have been able to produce life at some point. Although the odds seemed stacked against us, many scientists have been trying and testing out theories for years, such as with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, believes that they could send astronauts near Venus in a blimp-like vehicle, avoiding the immense heat and radiation that awaits on it's surface. Even with this theory, it does not fully help our curiosity of the planet, as with staying above means there is no way to collect samples of gas, rocks, or virtually anything. Other people at NASA have also theorized and worked on other approaches to studing Venus. They believe that simplified, silicon carbide reinforced electronics could help emmensely, as the metal can stay intact in Venus' harsh conditions for over three weeks.

Even with all the dangers of Venus being known, researchers are working on innovations that will help us learn more about our neighboring planet. The author states that "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." And with all of the facts he presents, he is very certain of this claim.
