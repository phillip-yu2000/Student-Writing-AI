Dear Principal,

In reference to the action that you are considering to take, of only allowing students with a B or higher to participate in sports I think you have made a reasonable and just decision.

Our world is changing and we need the "citizens of tomorrow" to have in their hands the tools that they will need to be of great benefit to their society. Now is the time when the world should be crying out for more scientists, philosophers, sociologists, psychologists, etc, and knowledgeable people to continue to improve the world and solve problems.

By preventing students below a grade B from participating in sports and other activities, you are providing an incentive for the students below a B to raise up their grade and you are also providing a more adequate environment for them to do so. This will also encourage the students with a grade B or higher to keep their grade at that level.

The question you should be asking yourself is if sports in fact slows down the learning process. If grades do improve after you change the new policy then you will know you have made a good decision. It is always good to try new things and learn from your mistakes then to not do anything at all.
