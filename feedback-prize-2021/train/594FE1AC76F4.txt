Dear senater i feel like we should overrule the elector college. I feel like this because it seem like the people vote dont count. The winner take all vote is super unfair. I think that who ever gets the most popular vote shoulkd be president because thats who the people want to president. Whats the point of having the people vote for president when they vote dont even count, its just the waste of their time.

The electoral college is made up of 538 and the majority vote is 270 that means that who gets the majority wins the election no matter what the popular vote saids. which is the winner takes all vote. You never know who on the electoral college they can be racist and dont vote for a black orÂ  mexican president. the eletoral college is is outed system of picking a president, and its time to pick a new system.
