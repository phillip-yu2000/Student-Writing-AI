The face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. Contrary to popular belief, it is just a rock formation that coincidentally looks like a face. Scientists figure it is just another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia.

The scientists at NASA made it a priority to obtain a clear photo of the face on Mars, due to the unlikely possibility that it is in fact, an alien artifact, for which they wanted a clear answer. When Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, it snapped a photo, much clearer than the one obtained by the Viking. When the photo surfaced online, it proved to be nothing but a natural landform. However, some people were not satisfied with this discovery. Conspiracy theorists began to theorize that there were alien markings hidden by haze, which caused for another search to get an even clearer picture, which was not easy. The photo obtained on April 8, 2001 was a phenomenal photo, which proved the face on mars to be a mesa, nothing but a happy accident, you could say. Conspiract theorists also believe that NASA is hiding evidence from the general public, which is absurd. A discovery like that of an ancient alien civilization on Mars would benefit NASA.

So in conclusion, the face on Mars is something much like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, just a natural landform.
