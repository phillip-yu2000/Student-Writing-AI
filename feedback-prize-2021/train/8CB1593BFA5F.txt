The ambitious goals of each person that feel less of cars can stop the pollutants throughout the world. People even feel that a shortening in car use can bring down or ease some stress. We may never know what the less use of cars can bring other than lower air pollution. From better air pollution to lower stress, all over the world these are some of the advantages of limiting car usage I feel will be made.

To start off, I feel it's safe to say that one of the main reasons of limiting car use is because of air pollution. Everyday more than millions of cars are being used throughout the day. Half of them are ranned by Disel fuel. This can be considered in France cautiosly throughout Paris where they typically have more smog than other European capitals. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe.

Second of all, when driving there can seem to be alot of tension or stress built up in a person prior to that 16 year old happy about driving her new Beetle on the road. When driving there are lots of distractions that can work a person up. You have those road raggers that just can't get over those slow driving grandma's on the road. Then you have those over protective driver's thats doing 30 in a 35 speed limit and is scared for the needle to even touch 35. You also have those ones that don't even want to be driving but didn't want to walk. Throughout that time of driving it's stressing you to your limit by either killing your mood, rudening your attitude, or just exhausting you to the max.       Â
