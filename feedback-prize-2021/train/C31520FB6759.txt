Using a phone during driving can be very distracting as well as dangerous. Driving already requires concentration so being preoccupied could endanger not only the driver but others as well. Phones also have uses that support multitasking. Despite this drivers still might get preoccupied and lose concentration. I think drivers should only be able to execute something simple like talking on the phone while driving.

Driving may look or sound fun but in truth it is very dangerous. Many people lost their lives behind the wheel either because there lack of concentration or a reckless driver. Sur vehicles have air bags but air bags don't guarantee safety. If u guarantee safety pulling out a phone while driving is not recommended. It's okay for non-drivers to have hones out because they do not require concentration.

In conclusion "should drivers be able to use phones for any reason while driving?" As stated earlier in the essay I believe talking on the phone should not be a problem for those who can multi-task. Things like texting should not be tolerated because it puts drivers and there passengers at risk. People behind wheels should realize that driving is dangerous.
