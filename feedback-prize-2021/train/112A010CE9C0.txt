In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" The is different attemps and making people smile. A human body feels what it feels and I do not think you can read somones mind. In my believe I think that the technology is good enough to be able to tell a humans emotions.

In the world today there are so many different people out there, some suffer from bipolar deprestion and some just hate the world. To get technology to be able to read someones mind and tell me wheather or not they are happy, sad, mad what ever ther cause is I just dont believe it. Like the story saying In the first paragraph in the first sentence, "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." I think that all this would be is a couple number put together to equal your 100 percent emoions.

This is why I disagure with the technology, because If a human can not tell you exacly what emotios they are feeling then how can technology.
