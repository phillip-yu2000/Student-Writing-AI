I think that it would be useful if the computer could know and understand the emotion expressions of the students, but I don't think that it could actually happen. The reason why is because you could text someone and you could be playing around but they could take it as if you are mad or angry at them.

For an example you and I could be texting back and forth and I could tell you something and you could say what ever and I could seriously take that into consideration that you are now mad at me. I peronally do not think that it could ever happen, but if it were ever to happen then yes I think that it could help the students. I personally think that it could possibly even help the students do better in school. If the computer were able to tell emotions and the expressions of the emotions, then I also fell that when a student is writing an essay and the teacher is reading it then they could tell how the student is feeling. Expessially if it is something that is serious and it is about the students childhood and their story is really depressing, then the teacher could understand the student more.

That is the reson why, I think that it would be useful if the computer could know and understand the emotion expressions of the students, but I don't think that it could actually happen. The reason why is because you could text someone and you could be playing around but they could take it as if you are mad or angry at them.
