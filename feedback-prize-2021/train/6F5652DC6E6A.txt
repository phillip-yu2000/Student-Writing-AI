My grandmother once told me, "When seeking advice always get more than one opinion." I think she told me that because, people opinions could be good for you and its probably a good idea for you to listen. Or that person thoughts could be horrible and could cost you your future as a criminal and that would lead to you being behind bars. But a positive outcome is that multiple opinions is better than one because what people think is the best idea for you is probably a good idea for you to listen. But also their ideas could be bad and good at the same time so when you apply the advice to the situation and could have a positive and negative outcome.

I personally think when getting advice always go search for it in your most trustworthy friends and family so that they can give you a good opinion. When you ask them and you receive lots of the same response it probably a good idea to listen and take their knowledge in and use it. Most importantly if you receive other information not like the other information your family and friends gave you its good to try the advice. Only to see if they give good advice or just to see if it was a better idea.

Also not all advice is good advice. Receiving advice from people that you know will lead you down a bad life or a bad lifestyle could get you into a lot of trouble or you could get hurt. When seeking advice make sure they know what they're talking about and if it doesn't seem right most likely their opinion is bad.

In conclusion, when getting advice make sure it sounds right and the person that is giving you the advice sounds correct and they will most likely be correct.
