Dear Principal,

I think that if the principal is going to do this then the school will not have a team she might have a average of five people on a team. If she goes to another school and look at the students that make the lowest of a C and no lower or they are off the team. She would find that they have a lot more student on their team then her school. If she would ask all the team who as made a C. A average of half the team would say they do. Most schools that have a sports teams if you make a D you will be kicked off the team. I know this because i am on a sports team i have to keep my grades up or i am off the team till i get that grade back up. If the rule if you make a C you are off the team was considered at my school most of my team would not be able to play.

If i was her i would not consider this rule it would make her lose most of her team it might just be one or two students but those two student could be your two best team players and the ones that make a B or A they have work ten times hard then what those other two students did. I would consider the principal to look in to how many students make C and then reconsider if she want this rule to be considered

Most of the sports players try not to get below a C or D but most students that play on a team are really trying to where some students that don't play sports don't really care about there grades. If i was her i would really look in to how many of the students that play on a sports team do make a C. Not every student is like they always make different grades. Most students try their every best to keep their grade no matter what. I say that if i was you don't change it because it will cause students that are on a sports team might lose their dream of become a sports player.
