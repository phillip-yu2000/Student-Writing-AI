Dear, senator

I belive the electoral college was a usefull tool in the past ,but is now an out date system that should be changed. If we continue to use this system we aren't really giving the people a fair chance to vote for who they want. For example in California a more democrtic state republicans may be lessen the incentive to vote knowing that there vote will not have an effect. This rasise another issue, which is not everybody is voting and it is not all a right but a prevlige among US citicens every where. The elctoral college was evective in the past because we did not have the technologe to count all the votes from each state, but now we do so we can only go by the popular vote.

The popular vote is more effective and I'm not the only one who thinks so over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Al Gore thanks to the electoral college won the popular vot but lost the elctoral, how is it that some one could win more votes from most voters ,but still lose? The answer is the elctoral college, the reason is that you are not voting as a indiviual person but as a state. This brings me back to California and how republicans votes don't count because the state voted democrat.

Though the electors should do there job and vote with the state they could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 segregationist nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would op-pose John F. Kennedy. So please take into consideration that your vote may not have an effect on the election if we don't change the system.
