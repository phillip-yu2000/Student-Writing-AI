TEACHER_NAME,

You should not make us do community service for it gives us less time to do things for our selves , nor will it allow us to do important things needed done.

As a teenage male I have many things that I want to do . If I don't have time for myself I cant hangout with my friends and I'm sure as a teenager you were having fun with your friends. This would keep us from playing the we want to play sports that I want to do like football , baseball and other sports that keep us healthy and self motivated. For us to not be able to do what we want outside of school would be insane .

Community service would not allow us to finish important school work needed to pass middle school and high school . If we were out working doing community service while we should be doing homework and projects we would never pass the needed courses to get into college. As the principal of SCHOOL_NAME you should know that we need to work hard but not service hours but on education.

Now TEACHER_NAME I would not want you to make a decision on just my letter, for you are a very wise man ,but consider what I have said on what we want and need.

Thank you ,

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME
