The face on Mars is not an alien formation but just a simple play on eyes. The face just hides in the shadows on mars. One reason I think it is just a shadow is that in the comparison pictures from 1976 to 1998 and 2001 all look different. They all give a different look on the face. Another reason i think the face on Mars is fake is, if there were civilations on mars they would also on the 3D image. So if there are no homes or shelthers there, who made it? No one did. It is a natural formation. Just like the ones in the United States of America. In the U.S.A those types of formations form in the Midwest. The formation is actualy called a butte or mesa. People say it reminds them of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This is why I think the face on Mars is just a natural formation and not the work of aliens.
