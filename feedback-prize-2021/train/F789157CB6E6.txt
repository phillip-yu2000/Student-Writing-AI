What's the Electoral College? Many people don't understand or don't know what its used for either. Its mostly used to decide who the president is going to be, but also for the popularity. The Electoral College is a helpful but harmful method, due to not updating the regulations of it. We should keep the Electoral College because thats what we've used since the beginning of our nation. Many people dont relise it but it does help us a lot when we have to decide who we want for president. My few reasons on why we should keep the Electoral College are, what happens with your vote, why we use the Electoral College.

Firstly, when you cast your vote it goes directly to an office to be counted and store for later. The Electors who cast the Real vote for the state look over the balets and decide who to vote for their state. Billions of people cast their votes but really only 270 count and those are the representatives for the states. You many think your vote doesn't count but in reality it does to the Electors of your state. We need to keep the Electoral College for our voters and to keep our tradition.

Secondly, we use the Electoral College to guid our electors on who the people want to lead our country and to help lead our country. Many people don't vote cause the lines are too long or they claim they don't have time but we really know that they don't care. Everyone should care cause we need everyone to vote and help the state electors choose who we want for president or who we want for other helpful positions.

Inconclusion, we need everyone to vote and we want them to know what happens to their vote. So Mr. Senator please dont take away the Electorak College.
