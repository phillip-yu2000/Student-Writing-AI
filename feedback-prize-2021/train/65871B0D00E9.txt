Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand their has been some controversy on whether or not to let my fellow students that aren't making a A or B in their classes are allowed to participate in extra curricular activities such as the sports programs. I believe that those students should be able to involved with the sports program.

Students who are not making A' s or B" s just might not be able to make the grade. Some students may suffer from learning handy caps. Yet, still their are people who may that " most kids do not try their hardest". .To the naysayer I

say this stud went my try their hardest at certain things and the best they might earn is a C. That is not the students fault. So why take away one of the only things that make them feel like they can be somebody and make nothing of their lives.

Another reason I am appose this is because the students are not at fault it is the teachers job to help them learn. People will most likely tell u the teachers give them the notes and problems to do, but are the students really learning. The young minds of the U.S need something that will catch their attention to help them learn. You could wrights down all the notes in the world ,but it won't help you if you can not keep your focus on it. So next time you say something think are tour teachers really teaching the students

My final reason I believe that they should let C students join in on fun is because the school could loose tonus of funding. Think about it. Most of the athletes on the teams are C students. If we loose all the players who will be left to play the game. Then their less pride at the school meaning less students. If their are not enogh students that
