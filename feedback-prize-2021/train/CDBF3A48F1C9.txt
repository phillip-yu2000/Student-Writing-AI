I beleieve that the use of this technology in classrooms is valuable. This new technology can read emotional expressions of students in a class setting. The technology could help teachers know if the students understand or not. This could also improve grades. Even police officers could use this instead of liar detecters. I say this could be a good tool.

Facial expressing is something not all of us are good at. But with new invention we could improve. For example the Mona Lisa is always questioned on wheather she is smilling or not. But now with this we would know that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. It is very amazing what this can show us.

Teachers could help there shy students with new invention. Most shy students wont ask when they dont understand what is going on. On the other hand shy or not our faces well always express emotion. So now teachers would know who is confused and help them. Sometimes they dont know if a student is upset and the teacher may think their actions are rude. But now this could let them know the student doesnt want to be rude he or she could be simply upset.

Later on this could even be used outside of a classroom setting. Some Police offices could use this on people the question. For example most people can lie but most peoples facial expressions change when you lie. This way the police officer doesnt have to run threw the trouble of setting a lier detecter up. Now this tool can be helpful in more than just a classroom setting.

I believe this could be a great tool. If our teacher can see and recognize confused faces then students get more help. Now the students have better shots at getting better grades. The more successful students are the more great tools like this come about.
