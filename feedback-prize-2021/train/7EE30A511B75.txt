Dear Principal,

I think that changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they maintain a grade B average instead of a grade C average is a great idea. Not only will this encourage students increase their grade average, but it will reward the students who have higher grades.

Many students consider being able to participate in activities or privilege that they want. This means that students will want to raise their grades in order to be able to have this privilege. I know I would. Many students don't try hard to do over the bare minimum of a C average, so they could be able to participate in activities and sports, but raising the minimum to a B would mean that everyone would need to try harder if they would want to be able to participate in activities. Students who do not keep an average high enough to play sports would have more time for studying, so that they can raise their grade high enough to play in sports.

Students who have a high enough grade to play will be rewarded and will feel special about having higher grades. This will encourage them to try even harder and be a better student. This could give them a better chance at getting into a more respectable college, and bring them more success over the course of their lifetime.

I think that you should increase the grade average required to participate in activities, because it will encourage students who aren't doing too well to do better, and even the students who are already achieving the required marks to do better, resulting in them to have a better quality education.

Sincerely, a concerned student.
