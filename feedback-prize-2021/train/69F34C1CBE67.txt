students and community service dear principal

This letter is debating if students should have to perform community service or not. Some reasons people would want to perform community service is to make kids more responsible and feel like they have helped the community and themselves. What think is that they should have a selected number of kids do the community service and see if it will impact or effect there grades or behavior at school.

Some reasons why the principal should let students perform community service is to give back to the community. Also another reason why they should do community service is that it might help them in school the way they act and how they are. The school should keep track and see if the community service is helping the kids on who they are or not.

These are some reasons why they should keep the community service around so it could help kids and there community. Community service can help the community and yourself if we all do community service it will help our community. This principal should keep community service at there school.
