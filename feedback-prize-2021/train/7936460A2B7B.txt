Driveless cars are coming isn't that great? What will the world be without drivers? Are their going to be people who will forget how to drive? Or is driving going to become an unnatural part of the human society?

The idea of having cars that drive by themselves seems wonderful. Personally I'm against that were going to have driveless cars. For example if one day the system fails, who are we going to blame.? Also whos going to be at fault, and how are the damags going to be solved or payed for. Througout time soon this will become a conterversial deal.

Secondly, are people just going to forget how to be independent and drive, or are they going to start relying on a computer to make all their decesions? As a driver myself I would'nt like a car taking me places without taking a hold of the wheel. Just imagine a driveless car will take all the enthusiasum out of driving.

Lastly, since technology is getting so advanced now in days and hackers are also coming along with the cyber world, the chances of getting kidnapped or fraud can increase. For example, lets say that a person needs to go somewhere by taxi. The taxi picks that person up and takes her to the correct destination, and when the time comes to pay she pulls out her debit card and swipes it. But instead of taking the correct amount a hacker takes all the money from her debit card. That again is fraud. Or lets say the instead of the driverless car taking her home, it drives out to an unkown part of the city and shes never seen again. Thats a perfect example of kidnapping. Therefore the security system will also have to increase.

In concluion, this technology would be great have abd a very useful tool that people can use. But it can aslo become an issue with society bringing up many issues. Especially if some people are going to try an use it for the bad. I would recommened to limit the time that would use driverless cars.
