Dear principal,

I think that with the situation you have been put in, the best thing to do is policy 1. I believe in this policy for more then just the reason of calling people and texting or doing something else during school hours is cool. I believe they are needed only for uses before and after school and that uses during school is just you being to nice to the students here at the school.

I know personally because i am one of these people, that you need your phone before school if you get rides from other people or if you think you might be late to the bus and you need to ask you friend to see if the bus is there. Even more important then that though, if you're parents want to contact you or need to find your ride after school and you don't know where they have parked and the your principle made the choice to band you from even bringing your phone to school, then might not have a ride home or an angry parent. So if you live over 5 miles away from school like me, then that's a long walk home.

So in conclusion, i think that policy 1 is the best for this situation and i would encourage you to choose that policy to run the new cell phone rules at our school.
