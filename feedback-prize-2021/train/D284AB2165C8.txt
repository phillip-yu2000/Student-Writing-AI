Have you ever really wanted something but you didn't know if you should get it.

It might be expensive, or it could just take up a lot of space.

Sometimes we only ask one person, and when doing this, we are making a huge mistake.

When you ask only one person, you are more prone to getting a bias opinion.

When someone has bias, it means that they are in favor of a something without any factual reason.

You think that people you know are not bias, but you probably believe the bias yourself.

If you have multiple opinions on the other hand, you are more likely to hear different viewpoints, which can help you make your decision.

An example of seeking multiple opinions is when I bought a fishing rod.

It's a very nice rod, and at the time this rod would subtract all of my Christmas money.

I had no idea whether I should get the rod, but what I did next helped me decide whether I would waste all my money, or if it would be money well spent.

I asked my Mother, who was with me at the store.

She thought that I would be wasting all my money, but she recommended that I speak with my Father.

I did what she asked, and lucky for me, he not only answered, but his friends were there with him.

They all gave me advice, and at the end said that it was a good deal.

I now had to consider myself why I should, and why I shouldn't buy the rod.

At the end, I decided to buy the rod, but it would have not been without the help of multiple people and their opinions.

Now you understand why multiple opinions help people make good decisions.

Multiple opinions help prevent one way thinking.

I hope that with the knowledge that you now know, you can go out and before you buy that cool new phone, ask multiple people who have the knowledge of that product.

Finally, never let one person help choose what you get.

Let several.
