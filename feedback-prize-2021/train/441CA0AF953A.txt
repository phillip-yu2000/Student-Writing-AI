I think government should change electoral voting to voting by popular vote. Americas government say every citizens vote counts but they are really only counting the electoral votes. Their was an incident in 2000 called "The disaster factor" according to source 2, this crisis let electors defy the will of the people. Some electors called "faithless electors" refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for who ever they want.

If we have electoral votes we might as well not have popular votes. People spend there time going to vote for the president they feel is better for this country yet, when they get home and watch the polls they realize the only votes they are counting are electoral. Growing up i was taught that every vote counts be voting just to vote for electorals just so they can vote for our president doesn't seem like im voting for myself it seem like they are voting for us.

In source 3 their counter-claim is that we should keep our electoral colleges, they also say "it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors." basically telling on themselves by saying our votes don't matter or count.

In source 2 they say "the electorsl colleg is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning" the electoral college isn't fair at all, if it was based off popular votes, candidates will have what it takes to win in any state they want.

In conclusion, in my opinion government should remove the electoral college, It is not a fair system to U.S. citizens every citizens vote should count so it should be abolished.
