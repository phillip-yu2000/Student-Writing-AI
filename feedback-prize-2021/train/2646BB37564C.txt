Dear Principal,

I believe it would be better if you let us bring our phones during lunch and free periods. I believe so because if a student needed to get into contact with his or her parent they would be able to during those designated periods. I also think it would be a good idea because I have lots of friends and I'm also assuming you do too now don't you like to stay in touch with those friends, it would make communication a whole lot easier. Now for educational purposes I hope you let us use our cell phones during designated periods because say you have algebra homework and you know a guy who is really smart in algebra and you need help. Well your doing it during lunch and your friend has a free period and everyone who you sit with is in math what are you to do without a cell phone if the teacher has a lunch break? I also believe it would be doing deed to society because cell phones are technology and, technology brings upon change now these students who are using their cell phones could get bored of what they do and write a letter to a cell phone company to make they innovation and instantly you have change. How would you, as a principal, feel to be the one who made a difference the one who changed modern society for the better? I hope that would make you very proud that you brought upon this change.

Thank you,
