I think things should be like the old days where not everone owned cars. There many advantages in limiting car usege, such as less accedince, better formed communities. There would be more people getting to know there neibors and would be a nice friendly place to stay. People would be in better shap and we would be the fatest country in the world anymore. Experts say automobels are the leading couse of green house gases.

Experts say that green house gases are poisioning are atmophere. So why would we poision what we need to live. why not hang up the keys and get a little exersise get some fresh air.

Its proven that people who exersise often feel better and live a little long. So insted of being lazy walk to work or school get in shap we need to stop teaching are youth that its ok to be lazy. Thats why are country is that fattest inn the world today.

If less people drive there will be less accedice less people will die because of careless driving or drunk driving. Its a fact that car crashes are the leading couse of teenage deaths. So why put yourself in that percent of people who crash just going to the store or to a friends house.

If communitys didnt have cars it would be just like the old days where everyone knew everyone. People would be more involved in the community there would be alot less crime because everone would most likely be friends with everone. people would be getting together and having  cook outs and having a good time with there niebors.

Those are the advantages i see in limiting car usage.
