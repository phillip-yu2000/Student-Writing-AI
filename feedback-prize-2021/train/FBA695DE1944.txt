I know the the reason that Luke joined the program because,according to the article in paragraph 1 it states , Luke's friend

Don Reist invited him to Europe on a cattle ship. Of course Luke could not say no to this offer when he knew it was an opportunnity of a life time.

When Luke arrived to New Orleans the day right after the Pacific war ended Stating in paragraph three. Luke already knew that this was a extordinary opportunity comeing forom him since he is just young man from a small town listed inparagraph 5. Luke knew from all the hard work he has done he was already nearly prepared for the work he would be doing on seas stated in paragraph 3,also he would be doing plenty of work from when animal needed to be feed at least 2-3 times a day plus thier stalls had to be cleaned. According to paragraph

8,

Luke would also have time with other people when the animals were boarded off they would play in thier stalls with volley balls or table tennis, boxing,fencing,reading and other game that passed time by.

Fianlly Luke knew bieng a Seagoing Cowboy would be a really great adventure. Being what he was helpin animals after war would surely open the world up to Luke himself. luke knew he was very greatful for the opportunity he had when it could been given to someone else. Luke stated in the article paragraph 9 ,"It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs", when they all needed help with thier lives Luke would come with supply and carry on to the one with the same problems unlike Luke , Luke had a nice life in his small town thats why he shared some with the world and helped many countries Luke gave his time and hard work to many's of hundred, one thing Luke surely did is that, Luke gave.
