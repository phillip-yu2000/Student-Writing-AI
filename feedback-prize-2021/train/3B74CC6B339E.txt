Thousands of axious web surfers were waiting when the first image appeared on a JPL websit revealing...a natural landform". Those people must've been really upset upon hearing this news. They had high hopes for The Face to be a creation of alien life on mars. But due to the fact that it's just a butte/mesa, an illusion, and just a piece of rock all together, those people need to accept the truth: Alien's didn't make The Face.

First of all, the Face is just an illusion, or a trick playing with your eyes. An example would be that when NASA unveiled the image, the caption said as quoted, "...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth..." This example shows that because of the perfect shadow casting, the rock formation on mars is just an illusion that's messing with your mind.

My second reason as to why The Face isn't a sign of alien life is that is resembles a butte or a mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. An example of this would be that it reminds Garvin of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This example shows that since it may remind people of other landforms that we have on Earth, and that we even have landforms similar to The Face at all, it must be and is a natural landform.

My third and final reason is that The Face is just a pile of Mars rocks. For example, when a foucused picture of this landform went viral, it was clear that it was just a pile of rocks, rather than the original picture, which was 10 times less foucused then the latest one. Knowing this, it is clear that aliens did NOT in fact, create The Face.

Some people might say that aliens mightve moved the rocks there themselves. This wouldn't be the case, considering that there are no clear signs of life on mars currently. No aliens means no alien made faces on mars. It's purely logical that The FAce is just an illusion and a pile of rocks and nothing more.
