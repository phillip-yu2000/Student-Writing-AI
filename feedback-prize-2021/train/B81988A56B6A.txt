I for one think that seeking for multiple opinions can help people a lot with making a better choice because people can have experience from doing specific things and sometimes making choices can be stressful for people who cant decide what to do, also asking a lot of people is the easiest way to make a decision on.

One reason why asking for advice from other people can be helpful is experience and experience is one of the most useful things to help with making decisions. For example, cooking because if you fail the first time baking cookies then you can start over again and learn what you did wrong from doing it the first time and try to make it better the second time and people who have experience with specific decisions can help other people out with making a good decision.

Another reason why asking for advice from people can help is being stressed because some people cant handle the responsibility of making the right or good decision and asking other people can make it less stressful for them to make because those people can help them out. For example, choosing a activity to do because some people might want to do a specific activity and other people might want to do a specific activity also and it can be stressful to decide so ask everyone to vote on what to do and make a agreement on the activity.

And for my final reason on this topic about asking for advice from people is asking people for advice is the easiest way to make a decision because if you cant decide what to do then just ask anyone around you. For example, ordering at a restaurant and restaurants have a lot of choices to choose from and if u cant decide what to choose from then just ask the waiter or ask other people around in the restaurant and ask them whats something good to eat and then your done picking what to eat.

In conclusion, asking people is a easy and less stressful way to make decisions.
