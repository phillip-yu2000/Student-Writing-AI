You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to travel to many places. The Seagoing Cowboys are gonna be hired because we would be in charge of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. They're are 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. The cattle-boat trips are unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy. It takes about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

Caring for the animals during the crossings keeps us busy. They have to be fed and watered two or three times a day. The bales of hay and bags of oats have to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. And the stalls are to be cleaned. The second trip you will be served as a night watchman. You have to check on all the animals every hour. You can find some time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys payed baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals have been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also help pass time.

Finally, being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an a adventure, it can open up the world and you will be grateful for this opportunity. You will be more aware of people from other countries and their needs. The awareness will stay with you, leading your family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.
