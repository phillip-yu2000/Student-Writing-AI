Cell Phone Policy response

I believe that the policy you will put into effect should be policy number 1. I agree that students should not be allowed to disrupt their learning by answering calls or texting in class. I do however believe that as long as teachers keep them from being used in class when the learning is going on, they won't be as much of a distraction.

First of all, I would like to defend my decision by saying that learning goes on in classrooms, during class. During free time, time in between classes, and lunch, there is usually no learning or educational content being taught.

I understand that we should be kept free of distractions such as cell phones during the time when attention needs to be on learning, and not on incoming calls or texts, but when students aren't learning anything, they should have access to their phones.

Another reason that I feel policy #1 should go into affect instead of policy #2 is that when kids at school aren't allowed to bring phones to school, kids won't have phones going to and from school.

These things would be even more distracting than receiving calls during classtime and might c
