As shown in the article"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supporte various forms of life, just like Earth". This conveys that Venus and Earth are more like twins because of how well they can satisfy the human needs and provide an adventurous lifestyle. Even though Venus has wonderful pros, it still has many cons as stated by the author "Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades" shows how hard it is for humas to actually place themselves on the planet. In conclusion, the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because as it shows similarities with the Earth-like planet, it also could affect the lives of those examing the significance of it. But this will not stop the humans from exploring the outer world. "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".
