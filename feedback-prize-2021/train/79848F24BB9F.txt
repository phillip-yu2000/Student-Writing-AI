In many cases, higher-level schools (such as middle and high school) require their students to complete some sort of project or assignment over summer vacation. This is an important task for students to take on, to insure that they keep their brains active and running smoothly. Creating a system where students choose their own project and compute it in a way that makes sense to them could, in turn develop a more inspired group of students.

Often times, leaders of any group come up with a "game plan' for their followers to carry on, but in many cases, said "game plan" might only make sense to the leader or designer of it. In classroom settings it is important for kids to learn in a way that flows with their individual brain. By letting students come up with and develop a study or project that they're passionate about could create a higher participation rate in secondary education. For example, a student who doesn't excel in things such as English or math could create a photo or video essay that reflects who they are and what they stand for. An athlete might spend the summer watching old, recorded basketball games and documenting how or what a certain player did in order to grow in the sport. Some families spend every chance they get traveling; maybe that child might write about and critique the places they visited, or even start a blog. The possibilities are endless.

A common misconception from teachers is that all students should be given an equal opportunity at the same assignment, but how is it an equal opportunity if not everyone's brain grasps concepts the same way? By changing common curriculum, and letting students draft their own projects and assignments, kids would feel more engaged and inspired to research and create something that they hold close to them, rather than something they feel no emotional connection to.Â
