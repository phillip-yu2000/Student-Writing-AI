Also, hearing from someone else can help you learn what not to do and how to prevent certain things. Specifically, people advising you to put on a seat belt in the car because they experienced what could happen, can help you prevent them things happening to you. They made a mistake by not putting on their seat belt, you took their advice and learned not to do the same.

In addition to, asking for advice can also lead to friendship. Knowing that you can trust their advice could make a bond. You having a friend to talk to and give you advice could get your mind of other things.

In conclusion, it is an good idea to seek multiple opinions. It can help someone make a better choice. It will prevent you from making a mistake. Their advice can teach you more then you think.
