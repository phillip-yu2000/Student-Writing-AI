I think that limiting car usage would be something good. My reason is for less car accidents. Many people drive reckless and speed and this is what causes these car accidents. We can save alot of people from getting injured in car accidents.

In this case we can also save traffic and causing people to be late to their jobs. This is why we should limit them also because of the gas rate. In this way we can save alot of money. Gas has been really expensive and this case we can save money and cause less accidents.

Nobody is willing to keep driving to stay safe and save gas money. "70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars and 57 percent sold their cars". I think that limiting this car usage would be a good thing for all of us. We would just have to find a safer way to get transportation.

In other ways alot of people drive around drunk and they cause alot of car accidents. This is something that is not fair for us innocent drivers. We would just have to find a new way to get us all transportation. Driving is something pretty dangerous though cause their really is alot of crazy drivers out their.
