Driverless cars have the potential to be somthing great. These cars could make the road a safer place and save you money. In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" the author makes points both for and againts driverless cars. Personally, I am for driverless cars.

Driverless cars could greatly reduce the amount of money spent on cars. Much like the cofounder of Google, Sergey Brin, I like the idea of being able to call for a driverless car. Sergey Brin foresees that these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis. Households could save the money they saved from not buying a car to go on a much needed family vacation.

Driverless cars could be much safer than a car driven by a human. These cars would have many sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius has a rotating sensor on the roof. While the human brain is amazing, it cannot process what is happening at all angles around the car. A hightened awareness of the car's surroundings could result in less wrecks. However, a human driver would still have to be in the front seat in case of an emergency.

Driverless cars could be intrumental in both long road trips and nights out. It can be very hard to stay awake when driving after a long day of work. The driverless car could drive while you doze off and has the ability to alert you when human supervision is needed. The same goes for long road trips. It is illegal and incredibly dangerous to drink and drive. With the driverless car, drinking and driving wrecks could be a thing of the past. After a night out you could crawl into your driverless car and be safe while it drives you home, given there is not a need for a human during the drive.

All in all, driverless cars could improve many aspects of life. The cars could save you money and allow you to rest after a long day. While there are still some risks associated with the driverless car, I believe the pros outweigh the cons.
