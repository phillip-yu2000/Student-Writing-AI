Generic_Name was running the fastest that she could,

suddenly she cross the final line ; Everyone was screaming from joy. Most teenagers can't participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons.

For example, in Generic_Name experience was because she had to look after her brothers.

Occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when

Generic_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day.

Generic_Name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream. Some parents think sports are a waste of time and that you are not going to needed in the future, although its going to help you in the future in many ways . For example, before Generic_Name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . Most teenagers don't like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do. Know you can decide what do you want to do after school.

I like the idea for students to participate in an extracurricular activities because students will have an activity to do after school and the will spend more time with there friends. If there is a student that don't have any friends this will help them make friends and learn new things. Teenagers should do at least one sport or participate in other activities for their own good. Do you participate in any extracurricular activities? why?
