Students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they would have nobody to talk, and they would be in the house all day doing noting but school work.

One reason students would not benefit from attending classes from home is because students would not have nobody to talk to if they attend classes at home and they would just be looking at the computer all day and wouldn't be able to talk to other people. When they can just attend school with a whole bunch of other students who have to learn just like you. You can also work together with friends you could make at school.

Another reason students would not benefit from attending classes from home is because they'll be at home all day and not going outside the house. It would be boring to stay in the house all the time and doing nothing but school work. Another thing is you would not be outside the house and you will be having the computer talk to you when you can just go outside the house and have a teacher that you can learn from in person because that how some people could learn better.

Some may argue that you could benefit from attending classes from home, like you could learn better by not being around a lot of other students and learn where there's nobody around, or just like being around their families where they're are more relax at. Others may argue that students would not benefit from attending classes at home. But it all depends on how a person learns. However if a person learns better with people around, or if a person learns better without people around them.

Students would not benefit from attending classes from home is because that person would have nobody to talk to and that person would be inside the house all day doing nothing but school work.
