Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Can students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Yes, I believe that offering students a distance learning class, it can help students who are stuck home sick, OSS, or if they're out of town. Students can truly benefit from a "at home class".

With distance learning students can learn and study class course inÂ the comfort of their own home, allowing them to feel more safe and not have problems with other people. It helps for students to stay safe keep them focus on the course. In addition, the classes can help students with homework, late classwork, or even tests and quizzes.

However, students can take advantage of these class course like cheat on tests or take the class and forget to do it or just not do it at all. Distance learning can be some what unorthodox for many students and even the school as a whole. But, some students would prefer a distance learning because they feel they would benefit more from it.

Some schools think that students can benefit from distance learning but, some students think they would be better with out it. I believe that distance learning can help students in many ways tho, it's just not made for some students. But, school to this day still offer distance learning to those who are willing to take the course.
