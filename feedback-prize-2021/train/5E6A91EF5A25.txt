There is much evidence to show that the Face is a natural landform created by natural causes. In paragraph seven, it is stated that with higher quality the picture revealed the natural landform. Critics assume the landform is alien made due to the pictures taken in 1976. However, as technology evolved over the span of twenty five years, the landmark was found once again and revealed the Face. ''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'' said Jim Gavin. Gavin then compared the landform on Mars to other landforms such as the butte or mesa around the American West. Gavin also stated that a landform similar to the one on Mars was in Idaho, called the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Scientists also ruled out the possibility of an extrasteral force creating the landform. The Face was first thought to be another Martian mesa. A Martian mesa is common around the area of Cydonia. With taking these factors into consideration, the landform was simply created by natural causes over the millions of years.
