Dear state senator.

I think that the electoral collage should be changed because it makes voting unfair, more people would vote,and it would be more effective.

The electoral voting system is unfair because your vote dosnt really count if the majority of the votes goes to the opposing party. It would be more even if your vote counted directly towards the party rather than voting for your states electors. I also feel that more people would vote because with the state electors your vote wont matter if the majority of is oppiste of who you voted for.

Also, other people would vote for other parties more rather than just the democratic or republican parties because the majority of the people are just gonna vote for those parties.

If the votes were not for the state electors and for the president than George W. Bush would not have been elected and the majority of the votes went towards John kerry so that wasnt fair for him.

Also every states number of electors is different, if they are going to have electors per state I think it should be the same amount for every state because if more of the states voted for the republicans but the democrats could have had the states with the larger amount of electors and won the election. The tinier states wouldnt do much for the election if they only have three electors. Also without electors voting, there would be a less chance of there being a tie in the election. It might make counting the votes easier but voting would be more effective if it was without state electors.

Those are the reasons why I think that the way voting is should be changed and hopfully someday it will be.
