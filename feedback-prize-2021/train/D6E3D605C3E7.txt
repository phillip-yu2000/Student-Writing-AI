This Face on Mars is not created by alien, it's just natural landform. If it's created by alien where are the alien? We have no prove, but i believe that this Face is just natural landform. We took a picture 3 times still there is no prove that alien created this Face. Do you even believe that there are alien out in the planet? Maybe but some people does, there might be an alien, but there is no way they are going to created that Face on Mars. If there is an aliens they wouldn't leave trace like that on Mars. We have been seeing this face form 1976 to 2001 still there is no prove. All we know is there is a Face on Mars. We doesn't know who created this face or where is came up form. Its just natural landform. NASA has been looking for it and take a lot of picture but there is not prove of who or what created. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute macimum resolution. 2001n image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. We look that close its there prove ? No! If you think this Face on Mars is created by aliens why did you stop looking information about it? There is no prove of an aliens created this Face. So its just natural landform, it created it self.
