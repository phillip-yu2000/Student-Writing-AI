State senator,

We should abolish electoral college, its unfair and non-democratic. The presidents  seat should be based on popular votes as the winner. Instead of this Electoral college that is clearly unfair  and has no clear outcome, look at what happened in 2000.

As stated in paragraph 16,"Gore had popular votes" but less electoral votes than Bush ,and Bush won that year. The problem is the

PEOPLE

are not voting for who should be president,its the electors that are electing the new or next president. This is so flawed needs to be changed like now.

The collage electoral process does have its benefits like if a president candidate increased his popularity in states he knew he could win popularity in, That would gain no electoral votes. The winner take all method sounds like a great idea. As stated in paragraph 20,The most thoughtful voters should be ones to to decide the election,

but their is a flaw with that even the most thoughtful people in the world make mistakes. Look at what happened with Nixon. The president is only one person. People make mistakes. Let the People make mistakes instead of forcing everything into a box like congress.

Is their a limit on how many electors the president chooses,I hope so. A elector doesn't have to vote for a president you voted for because your are actually voting for that candidate elector, Witch is so confusing. Winning votes by popularity is the way to go.
