You should keep the Electoral College because it was a fair and easy way of voting.

The founding fathers established the constitution as a compromise between the election for the president by the vote of congress and the electionof the president by popular vote of citizens.

The elctoral college process consists of the selection of electors. The meeting where the electors vote for the president and vice president, and counting the electoral votes by congress."The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college."For this reason the word "state" also refers to the Distruct of Columbia.

What's wrong with electoral college? " Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." So who picks the electors in the first place? "It depends in some states. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."Most voters think the electoral college is unfair."The winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the "swing" states."

In conclusion, I think the Electoral college is fair, but others don't. I guess we wont know unless we vote on it.
