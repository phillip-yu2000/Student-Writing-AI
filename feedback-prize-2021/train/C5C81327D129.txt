I think the Facial Action Coding System is valuable. It also doesnt do any harm, so i think ther shouldnt be an agument on why they shouldnt event ths type of technology. Making these types of inventions can even be helpful not just for the Facil Action Coding system but to many other inventions. They are becoming more advanced in technology and are capable of developing more interesting inventions. Many students also some times have problems trying to fihure out what there feeling or to tell some one how they feel. I agree that the Facial Action coding System is valuable and ould be used for goods.

This technology can be used for many thing and in a very good way. For ecample like the author wrote in the article. They can make changes in many things by seeing the emotions in a sudents face. For example in some ones homwork, in a book there reading. By reading there face expresions they can use that technology for the good of a person. They can find new things and make changes. So the things that are boring or sad or anything that is making someone not be intirested in something make them more intiresting. In my opinion people that make stories or news papr aricles want there work to be seen and get many reviews. So by figuring out what some one is really intirested in is a good way know. Many people like new developments. If this type of work becomes more advanced it could be something good.

In my opinion i think its valuable. It does no harm to some one and it heps so some one could be under stood and helped. This technology could be used for many thing. Its also once more a new invention and helpful for many more. It also is a very intiresing in the way it works. Just because it was well diveloped to know how the human face works and the changes it makesevery time it has a diffirent expression. Thats why i think this development is very valuable.
