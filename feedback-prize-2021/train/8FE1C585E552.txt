My prinicipal has just made it official, all of us students must participate in one activity during school. This is great for all of the students, even research will say. For example, sitting at our desks all day will increase the risk of health problems, and also decrease the blood flow to your brain. Therefore, this change to get us in extracurricular activities during the day, in my opinion, is great.

You might be doing yearbook year book or serving on the student council and thinking, how is the benefiting us? Well, let me tell you, both of these activities will make us communicate, be vocal, be involved, and be up and moving. Some of the classes we take do not get us up and working with other people/communicating. So, either way you put it, in some way, serving on student council or doing year book will have a positive affect. This may even benefit us with social skills more so than the classroom.

Sports, these activities will be very good for our health. Having us active, not sitiing down all day, and having a bit of fun is a win. If you would think about the difference compared to sitting at our desks all day, this activity decreases the risk of health issues and increases the blood flow to your brain. The comparrison of health between sitting and being active are polar opposites. Every sport that they have to offer us is benefiting us in our health, but might also lead us to building new relationships with other students.

This is a wonderful change, thanks to our principal. If you look at the facts this will have a positive impact on not only our school, but us students. If you really take this into consideration, it makes total sense why they did this for our school. Half of the students aren't very involved in the classroom, so, maybe this will let them have fun, while also being involved.
