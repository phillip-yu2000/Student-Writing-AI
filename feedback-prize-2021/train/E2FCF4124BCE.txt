Why is seeking other peoples opinion can help someone make a better a choice? Seeking for one persons opinion is not a choice, it's an advice that could be right or wrong so you could just take it or loose it. Don't get me wrong I believe people and friends have good advice but sometimes you just need to think if it's the right advice for you, depends on what problem you have.

However, with multiple people you can listen on what they think and from what there saying you instantly can tell if it's a right or wrong choice, and the person needs to know what position your going through so they can help you out. With one person it's hard to choose who your going to talk to cause not everyone has the best nor the worst advice or solutions. When it comes to different personality's it also comes with different result's and it's shocking to hear other peoples opinion when it's way far different from the others, I think that's why it's better to have more then one opinion cause as your listening on what there saying it's it's almost like being in the person's mind and seeing a different type of perspective.

I think having multiple people with multiple opinions can help a lot, because a lot of people could have the same experience that you had before, but if they did not then that's something different but I also think it's based on the person who is giving you advice, for an example if you had a funny or silly friend who is always your best pal but yet you come across a situation that is serious and you come to them for advice and they still act kind a funny with it I would say that's not the best person to come to, but if it was a more serious and chill type of friend I would go to them to get the best result but that's just me. Again not everyone has a best answer but what you hear off of them can help you make the better choice.

In conclusion having more then one opinion is the best way to help you out in any situation cause listening to other peoples opinion it's like your seeing from there point of view on how would they handle it and just by sorting it out from the wrong to the rights you can make your way to a better answer.
