Hi im going to tell an argument from lukes point of view using deatails from the artical.

Here are some reasons why you should come. First you should come beacause it might be the only time you will get to go to help other people from World War ll, so that would be a great opportunity to come.

Another reason is you would get to see out side of you country,and you would get to see other countrys. Also you would see what culture and gods they worship. You might even learn new things like how to grow carrots, or watermelon.

One more reason is you can even have fun on board. Like when you are coming back the animals would be unloaded and you would get to pet them and maby some animals like fetch. You could even play volleyball, or baseball in the empty hold wear animals had been. They also had tournements like baseball,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also help pass time.

Well that is it I gave you three reasons why you should participate in the seagoing cowboys program. I hope this will make your dicisean easyer. Thankyou.
