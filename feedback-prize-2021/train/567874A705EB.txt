I would like to drive a driverless care because you could just sit back and let the car do the driving.

A good thing about driving a driverless car is that you could sit back and let the car do the driving as it says in (paragraph 7 and line 5).

They only time you would have to actually drive the car is in construction or a place where there has been a wreck. The negitive part to this car is that it is probably really expensive. You would actually have to pay attention to the road because the car might not react to something running in the middle of the street at the last second. And another thing might be it may take more part for the car to be driverless, which makes it harder and more expensive to drive.

The driverless car would be a really cool invention that could allow driver to relax but also cause more stress. This wouldn't be a good car for a first year driver but maybe for someone that has plenty of experience with driving.
