Do you like to go on adventures? Do you like helping others? Then come sign up to become a seagoing cowboy! If you dissagree to sign up, here are some reasons why. I'm sure I'll convince you!

One of my reasons why you should join is because you are able to help others around the world. World War II ended in 1945, and peoples houses were destroyed from the war. This is a perfect time to help out and help build more houses. The people would be in joy and delightment for how you helped and you'll feel proud of what you accomplished. How about another reason why you should sign up?

Another reason to sign up is because you can travel around the world. If you like to explore, this would be the perfect time to join. You will travel to places like Europe,Greece,and China, which looks amazing by the way. These aren't the only reasons to sign up, but these are a couple of my favorite reasons why you should join. All of this brings me to my conclusion.

In conclusion, you should sign up because, One, you get a chance to help around the world, and two, because you can travel and see alot of places that you've never seen. It's alot of fun and great for the world. I hope you join!
