Against the developing of driverless cars. Driverless cars will we a dangerous hazard, they require a lot of sensors, a ready driver, specific conditions and waiting on the law.

Driveless cars require a lot of sensors without any sensors the cars would not be able to go forward, backwards, applying breaks, reducing power from the engine or drive themselves because the sensors are what keeps them from crashing into other vehicles.

Driverless cars need a read driver at a times. The vehicle can handle driving functions at speed up to 25 miles per hour, but require a driver to keep a hold of the steering wheel. These cars will give you signal telling you it is time to take over the steering wheel becasue the road conditions, construction site or an accident is happening or occured ahead.

When the car is driving itself it needs to have specific road or navigation conditions. If there has been an accident, a construction site or traffic the car might signal you to take over the wheel and let you drive instead because it can't drive itself through these conditions. This mean that the driver has to be alert and ready to take over when the situation requires.

There are traffics laws stating that only a safe car has a human driver in control at all times. And as a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. So far California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars.

Driveless cars will be a dangerous hazard because they require a lot of sensors, a ready driver, and specific conditions in order to run properly.
