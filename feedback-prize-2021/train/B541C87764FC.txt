When people ask for advice they usually ask for advice in different areas like say you need help with a babys name you wouldnt know, thats why you need different opinions from your family, friends co-workers, people that care about you , people that would give you a great opinion or in this case , a great name to name your newborn baby.

Once you have a problem in mind that you caant seem to figure out and have trouble with, you tend to get a little hasty and you have to go around your friend group etc and get different opinions from everyone.

Different opinions are a great way to make the right decision, if you get bad opinions you can get the wrong idea and make a bad decision thats why you need to be careful who you ask and how you ask for an opinion.

More than one opinion, and both times they are the same opinion you are more likely to be right or make the right decision the first time than get a bad opinion and be wrong all the time.

In conclusion different opinions are a great way to make somehting happen, or make a right decision and have a great outcome, and having a bad opinion can lead you to a bad oucome and worse answers to your problem.
