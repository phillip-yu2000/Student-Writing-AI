Luke was a sea cowboy he described every thing wonderful and great but is he just saying that to bring more people in the business .

My first reason that shows that Luke is maybe trying to bring more people to work with him is that in the whole script he only comes across one problem but everything else is great which is hard to believe because in the sea there could be storms ,waves,floods or leaks on the boat but surprisingly he never comes across any of those problems which is odd.

My second reason that shows that Luke is just trying to bring people into the business is in the text it said that Luke kept on saying that he got to ride gondola in the streets of water in Spain,and got to excavate a castle in create , and even got to see the Panama Canal on his way to China so he is basically saying that all of the things he did where fun he got to go siht seeing but not everything he did could of been fun he also had to feed animals and clean stables so not every thing he did was fun.

In conclusion these reasons show Luke maybe is liens but maybe he is telling the truth its up to you to choose a side is he lying or not so maybe just maybe he could be telling the truth.
