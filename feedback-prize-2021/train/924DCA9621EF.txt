Studying Venus is a worthy persuit alhtough it presents some dangers. Studying Venus and sending a spacecraft or even people would further our knoledg on the planet, it could help us further our technology aswell, and it is Earth's "twin".

We could learn so many new htings about the planet. Things that cant be seen because of Venus's thick atmosphere. We already know that the Earth and Venus have many things in common like mountains and vallys and craters, but if there were to be a mission on Venus where a space craft lands or an actual human is sent ont he ission we could discover how Venus came to have those mountains and valleys and craters.

With furthering our knoledge about the planet we could also further our knoledge in our technology. There has not been any spacecraft that has been named that has gone on a mission to Venus becuase they never last more than a few hours. We could betterthat technology so that the spacecrafts can last a lot longer to where ventually we can send people. We can have a simulated enviorment of Venus and test different materials to see which works best and improve it as we go. The improvements in technology could help us in future missions aswell.

Venus in known to have things in common with Earth which is another reason why Studyig Venus is a worthy pursuit. It is the planet that resebles Earth in its geography and it would be worth knowing how Venus got that. We can also discover new ways in which it is our planet's "twin".

We should take to challenge and study Venus. It may take years and it is dangerous but it is a worthy pursuit. We are aware of the dangers and difficulty of studying Venus; it is just the matter of accepting the challenge or not.
