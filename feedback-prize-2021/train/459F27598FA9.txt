Dear Principal,

I heard you were thinking about changing the policy's for athletes to play sports. I think its a good idea that you make all the athletes get a B or higher on there report card. The reason I think its a good idea is because school is generated to get kids into college so they can get good jobs but if they have a C in 3

subjects there passing but barley passing and they may not get into college. If they have a B or A in every subject they are more likely to go to college. Another reason why I agree is because athletes think that they can slack off if they have a C then its distracting to other students that are trying to concentrate on there work because the athletes will just talk and yell out in class. Are school may go down in players for sports but eventually they will learn that they cant just slack off in class they actually got to try and get good grades to play. I think this may have more an affect on the people who start in games because they want to play more then the rest of the team and they don't want to lose there starting spot because its hard to get back once you lose it. This policy will probably work better if you get the parents involved with it because most athletes have a parent that wants them to play and they will be very mad if they cant play just because they slacked off in class they will probably get grounded in till there grades come up to were they can play again. That is why I think are principal should set this policy for are school. Thank you for reading this and I hope you consider making this policy.

Sincerely,
