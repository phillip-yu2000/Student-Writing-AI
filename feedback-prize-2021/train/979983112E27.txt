Dear Principal,

I think that you shouldn't make everyone do community service hours. Community service is good but some people, like me, just don't have the time.

There are many students who play sports and have practice almost everyday. How would they find the time to do community service hours? Most of these athletes have good grades and the sports will help them get into college so you wouldn't want to take away their chance of going to college. The ones who do more than one sport are very talented and if they would have to do community service hours then they would be taking a chance of losing some of their talent instead of getting better.

There's also the people who have to study a lot in order to get the good grades they have. If they had to do community service hours then that would take away time from then studying and their grades would start to slip. Then our school wouldn't be a very smart one.

If there are people who want to do community service then maybe you could get a club of people who go out and do that. So then, the people who want can do it and then the people who don't have the time or don't wish to participate don't have to. It would make everyone happy and the athletes could keep playing their sports, the people who need to study can study, and the people who want to help the community can help out.
