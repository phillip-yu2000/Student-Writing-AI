There are three reasons why you shoud join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

First you get to help many nations with food supplies and animals, like young cows, mules, and horses, to get over seas. Second you can see many places across the ocean. The Seagoing Cowboys have a lot of free time on their hands, so they can visit a lot of places. If the Seagoing Cowboys are in Venice, Italy you could take a gondola ride. Or if they are in Greece the Seagoing Cowboys could see the Acropolis.

The third and final reason why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is you could do lots of fun fun stuff with other people. That stuff could be playing vollyball, baseball, table-tennis, boxing, or fencing. You could also do stuff on your own like reading or whittling

Those are three reasons, helping nations, sight seeing, and having fun with other people doing the same thing (or by yourself), are why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
