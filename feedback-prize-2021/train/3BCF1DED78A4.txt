The concept of the automobile in the early 1900s was enough to make others pursue the dream of having one. As car dealerships made better looking, faster, high performance cars, the more people wanted them. After World War II when cars became inexpensive, more and more people had them. But it's also becoming an issue. Recently, that trend is going down.

To begin, the car industry has been at an all time high. We're making cars so fuel efficient, it almost seems impossible. We even have hybrid cars, which run on electric and fuel (respectively). But with all of the cars out there, especially in the US, the pollution in nations and our own cities are at an all time high. China's air pollution is the worst in the world. Nations have been taking the initiative to partially ban car use for a few days. Paris for instance, banned motorists with even-numbered license plates from using their vehicles, switching to odd-numbered the following day.

Furthermore, we have Bogota, Colombia who took a different approach to the rising air pollution. Instead of what Paris did, they banned automobile use in general, for one day. Buses and taxis still ran, but private vehicles did not. This seeminly little feat over time has done wonders on the city. More and more cities, including nations, are beginning this practice.

To sum things up, we see that there are advantages (and of course disadvantages) to limiting car use. Companies may lose money if they transport items. But as a whole, it's only a few days. Or even one day, that no one drives a vehicle. It's a perfect time to ride a bike, and lower air pollution in a city.
