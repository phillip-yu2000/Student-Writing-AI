I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it give students a chance to be more social, and active. It also gives students an idea for what they want to do in the future. Most students stay at home, watch TV, and eat snacks, which is very unhealthy. Kids these days are not as active or as social as they should be. Extracurricular activity gives students a chance to get up, and get moving. Sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball, are things that get kids excited about geting up, and getting active. Extracurricular doesn't only allow kids to get up and get moving, it also give students a glimpse into the real world. For example students that want to go out for student council get the experience of what its like to work in the office, and be a boss to people. Most students that go out for the yearbook might want to be a professional photographer when they grow up. Yearbook is a great way to start, every professional has to start small somewhere, and yearbook is the right place. Professional athletes weren't always as great as they are now. They all had to start out small, and see they're mistakes and fix it. In conclusion, I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it gives students an idea for the future and also sets goals for students. Every profession has their own weaknesses, but with more help, and more focus,

and dedication their strengths always come out.
