school policy

It has come to my attention TEACHER_NAME i understand that you like the students to be very well educated, and i see that you want them to be the best they can but for some student that is not the case. Some students want to play sports and do good at school but sometimes they are ineligible to maintain a b average. Most of the time the kids that are playing sports feel that they cant play because they feel that they will not be able to maintain a c average and they could not play.

also it has come to my attention that the players that are on a team at the moment seem to be doing fine and need no help to bring their grades up. If you raise the grade average it could not only become a struggling manner for the player but also the league. By raising the average most players may not be eligible to play on the team and with not enough team members to play on the team they will have to shut down the team.

Now i see that your argument is a very valid one and that every kid should stride for perfection but some kids and not only that but also the extra curricular events while maintaining these grades such as soccer, football, baseball, basketball, lacrosse, cheerleading, and hockey. They should stride to be the best at every class and not only that but the sport they are currently active in at the moment.
