Limiting car usage has a lot of advantages in everyday life. Cars are the one destroying the planet. When the cars' smoke gets to the atmosphere, the atmosphere gets destroyed by it. If we destroy the atmosphere then what or who is going to take care of our planet from the powerful sunlight. Also limiting cars may also save you a lot of money. Think about all the money we spend on gas for cars, we can do a lot better for the world with all that money.

Now I'm going to talk about some evidence in the article that makes limiting car usage better for life. In source 1 "In German Suburb, Life Goes Without Cars", Heidrum Walter, a citizen from Vauban said that she lives happier without cars because when she had a car she was always tense (paragraph 3). Now in sourse 2 the article says that cold nights and warm days caused the warmer of air to trap car emissions(paragraph 15), and that is really bad. Also in source 2 again the last paragraph says that the smog cleared when they banned the usage of cars.

In source 3 paragraph 24 Carlos Arturo a businessman from Bogota, Colombia said when Bogota's streets were car-free that it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. At last, source 4 says that now that there is less driving, safety in the cities have improved.

So I say that we must limit car usage because of all the things i mensioned in the previous paragraphs. The city will be safer, the planet will be safer and everything will be better.       Â
