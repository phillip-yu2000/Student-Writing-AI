My position on driverless cars are that its a good idea. I think its good idea beccause it will cut down on fuel, not as many deaths because the people won't be driving it, it will be more comfortable and flexable. Driverless cars are a good idea to stay safe and get to somewhere more efficient, better than a taxi.

To have driverless cars mean that they could cut down on fuel. In the text it says that one of their cars used half of what taxi cars use right now. They will not have to deal with deaths because the driver is not driving. In the passage it shows that the car ddrove half of a million miles and did not crash once. Many of accidents today are because of people that are drunk driving, but because of the driverless cars there wont be as manny deaths as there is right now.

Other ideas are that people are not comfortable in the car. They could finally be comfortable in the car because they dont have to drive. Just think of this you can sleep in the car and no accidents could happen. You could get to places farther in a more efficient time.

Therefore, I think having driverless cars are a good thing to look forward in the future. You could have no more pollution and no more crashes and deaths. So look at the bright side of driverless cars instead of the bad sides. Driverless cars are a good thing to think about having in the future.
