Schools offer distant learning as an option for student's who likes work from home, can there be good or bad benefits from working at home?. I think that working at home would not benefit student's, reason being home is more comfortable and relaxing .Working at a public school can help you get opportunity's with friend's or teacher's like a job or college career. Public school is more efficient because, other students can help you out on work and at home no one is there to ask for help. Talking to a teacher in person can be so much more helpful then on a computer . Staying after school is a big benefit to people who prefer public school because you can get work done that is needed, but at home I feel like you can't get the same help you need on the work.

Working from home can have its benefits like being with family more often. Working from home can be challenging for some people because home is more comfortable therefore the student would become more lazy and get bad grades. One thing about working at home is you would make your own schedule which could be flexible to your own time. Students who work at home would have no one to help them out with work outside of class which would be hard on the student

Students who go to public schools will benefit more then the students that work at home. Public schools bring more opportunity's as distant learning would not get as many . This issue could be solved depending on the student, some students like to be at home and some like to go to public schools . Public schools help student's with college information and helps the student choose his path in life. Working in a public school environment, helps more students do better in there classes makes them more productive.
