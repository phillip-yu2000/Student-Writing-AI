Dear State Senator,

Perhaps you may know about the 'electoral college'. In my point of view, I would keep the electoral college because it's better and the process has been the same in decades. So why change it?

The Electoral College is better because it's more fair. In the story, What Is the Electoral College?, it tells how the voting for president and vice president works." one for each memeber in the house of representatives plus for your senators" Meaning the state votings plus the the number of members in the Congressional delegation. Also in the the story, What Is the Electoral College?, it states " Each candidate running for President in your state his or her own group electors"...... "but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are".

In other words, canadiates that are running for President have their own people to elect them but the state laws say that candidates are suppose to be elected by their responsibilities. Even though other say " the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" I think it is fair for how they process the Electoral College because it let's the candidate that you or that your state is voting have the opportunity to make some changes in the world.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME.
