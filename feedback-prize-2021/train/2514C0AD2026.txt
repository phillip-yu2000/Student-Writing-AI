To our principal,

I fully support "Policy 1" on cell phone usage and completely against "Policy 2".

I believe that students have a right to bring along a cell phone and carry it on themselves as long as it is not a distraction or disturbance to the learning environment. They should be allowed to use them during instances allowing them.

If they are seen with their cell phones out while a teacher is in the middle of an important lecture, unless he or she has gotten permission from the teacher it shall be confiscated immediately. When there are times allowing cell phones to be used, if a student is caught giving answers to a test or talking to someone in class, their phone should be taken up. One thing that bothers me is students cheat using paper all the time but teachers only get upset when it is done over cell phone. I think it's the same information, just being transferred a different way. There is no telling what students say to each other, using notes or cell phones. It could easily be on both. If a student's phone is taken up for them talking to someone, why do teachers not take up paper notes being passed? They are doing the same action, only on a different device.

I also believe that cell phones are a good way to contact someone outside of school. Let's use someone left their lunch at home for example. It would be easier to let your teacher know and to have them allow to contact their parent via cell phone in class than to have to get permission to go down to the front office, ask permission to use the phone, and then call. Also, some people use their electronic contact book and don't memorize numbers. The school may have your house number on file but they don't have your parent's work number or cell phone number. It would be better to contact them using a number they can recognise. Some people don't answer to numbers they don't know, even with the exception of caller ID.
