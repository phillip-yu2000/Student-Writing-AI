Today i will be talking about some good reasons to join the program seagoing cowboys. i will also be trying to get people to sign up for it. I think it would be a great idea to sign up for it.

Here are some reasons why youu should sign up. You could help people out by going and helping with the food supplies, horses, cattle, youn cows, mules,and more. It would be doing a good deade too.

Another good reason is it might be a opportunity that you may never get to take again or if you wanted to try it too see if you like it.

If you are 18 though you could be drafted for military service so if u ever wanted to be apart of the military service it would be a good idea to sign up. Another good reason is if you wanted to just go and look at some new places this would be a good idea because they travel a lot and make a lot of trips.

Going on trips like this to places that need help because they just got out of worl war ll can make you see how much more help thses people need then you do. Another really good idea is that if you ever wanted a chance to help out with animals and stuff and never got a chance to this would be a good idea since they help out with all that.

In this essay i was trying to get people to sign up for seagoing cowboys. I hope the reasons i gave you was helpful enough for people to see that it would be a good idea to go and help out all the people that are in need and to help out with the food and animals and stuff. I hope some of you who read this will sign up.
