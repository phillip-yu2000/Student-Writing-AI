Can we actually " calculate" emotions like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movments we humans use to express how we feel? I think if we had technoligy like this to see emotional expressions if students that would sovle a lot of problems. It tells someone how they are feeling without using words. Yes I do think it's valuable but at the same time I dont agree with it because theres such a thing called privcy and I dont with anyone wants to be read like a book because if the world sees us all as the same no one would be special. At the same time no one can tell you how your feeling beside ourself and I don't think a computer could tell the full story. I know thats not all the feelings in mona Lisa's face, there ahs to be more to it, there always is. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists but what if they are wrong? We don't know for sure, we just relie on people who tell us what we want to believe and we have no choice but to believe them. There is more to emotions then just happiness, suprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness. What about curiosity, passion, stress, guilt, excitment and etc but you get the point.
