Distance learning is a good thing because it allows kids who can't come to school a chance to get education. This could also become a casual tool that allows kids who missed school to get and stay caught up with their classes. People all over the world could benefit from this new form of technology.

Sometimes as a person with high anxiety, I dont like school because of all the loud and compacted areas. With distance learning this allows me to be able to focus somewhere and feel safe. This also goes with anything else as well, you dont have to have anything wrong with you to use it. Maybe you wake up one day and realize today isn't a good day, not an issue call in do what you gotta do and attend class online.

People who attend school regularly can benefit too. Say you miss a day or two of school due to the flu, with distance learning you can be there still while at home taking notes and keeping yourself rested. This could be integrated in many other ways as well, maybe the teacher is out one day or not everyone could go on the field trip. This technology opens a whole new door to the learning world and allows kids to expand and strengthen their education.

Kids who cant come to school should all be offered a chance, everyone should have an education and with this new technology you can. Third world countries where there's people who have never gotten education will now have that option available. Kids who cant control their lives in those particular places shouldn't be shut off from society. With this we will be able to teach and give knowledge to other people to hopefully make something more beneficial.

Distance learning benefits everyone because it makes education more accessible and helpful to all. With this new innovative technology people will be able to build past knowledge and even gain new. people all over the world will be impacted by this technology even if you don't directly use it.
