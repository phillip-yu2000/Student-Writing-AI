Venus is dangerous to human just like many other planets. This author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that it presents. Should this author really study planet Venus?

Some people look at Venus as Earth's "twin", because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size, and sometimes closer in distance as well. Since Venus is so close to the Earth they have sent multiple spacecrafts tp the planet but no spacecraft survived for more than a few hours. A spaceship has not touched Venus in over three decades. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus, that is even more dnagerous for humans to survive on. On Venus surfce it is over 800 degrees fahrenheit, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what ours is on planet Earth.

Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because a long time ago the planet could have once been just like planet Earth, today Venus still has some features but not many. In this article NASA has discovered a compelling idea for sending humans to Venys to study the planet. To study Venus the scientists would have to float above the fray, which is 30 or so miles above planet Venus. At 30 miles or so above the surface the temperature is still 170 degrees fahrenheit. Scientoss can not take very graphic pictures, get samples of rock, or gas from a distance, therefore the scientists have to get close and personal no metter the risks of he planet. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.

Even though there are many dangers on studying thid planet this author still wants to. There are many reasons s to why this author wants to study this planetand they are all great, but i think that it is still dangerous.
