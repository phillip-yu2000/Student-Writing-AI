Should drivers be able or not be able to use their cellphones while driving.

I will explain how drivers can be able to use their cellphones and how they can't use their cellphones.

there are many resources that you can use to help you understand whether or not cellphone usage is allowed. there are some pros for cell phone usage and some cons for cell phone usage. I really prefer not using cellphones.

Drivers should not use their cellphones while they are driving because a lot of things could happen like getting in car accidents, getting pulled over by the cops,

killing somebody else that is like crossing the road or street and you could get arrested. One reason why they shouldn't have cellphones because people insurance bill or rates goes up. People dealing with health problems and car accidents. Drivers be looking down at their phones and trying to text back to someone while driving which means that they are being distracted.

Drivers are allowed to use their cell phones only if they are talking on the phone while the phone is on speaker.

Drivers can talk on the phone through bluetooth headphones.

Drivers can also talk on phones, leave a message, call someone, and more on bluetooth in cars that only have a bluetooth speaker in them. If drivers have a passenger sitting beside them, then they could ask them if they could text, call, leave a message, or anything else to that person they are trying to reach. So there are some good with drivers having cell phone usage.
