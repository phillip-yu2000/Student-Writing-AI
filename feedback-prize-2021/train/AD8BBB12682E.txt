Dear Principal,

I firmly believe that students must have a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. there really isn't any way to elaborate on this issue, because it is simply an easy argument to be made. Students are supposed to come to school to be educated not to play basketball. So, shouldn't their education be the main focus of their schooling? Some may argue that it is not fair to the students that have learning disabilities, who already have a hard time maintaining a C average as it is. However, it is the job of the public schooling to provide them with the help they need in order to succeed. If we don't, then it comes down to the government not doing their jobs. But, I hope this is not the case.

So in all, if we let the school's star soccer player slide with a C average, what kind of examples are we setting to each other or the next generation? We need to challenge our students to strive to their fullest extent. Not to what they want to do, but what they need to learn and know.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
