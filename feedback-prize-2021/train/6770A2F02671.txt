Dear

Principle,

I disagree heavily with your idea to only allow the students to play sports if they have a B or higher on their grades. it is unfair and should never be approved. I cant believe that you, the principle of the school, are saying that kids aren't allowed to play sports if they don't have a good grade.

First of all for some kids, sports are all they've have. They may hope that they will be a professional sports athlete in the future. But because you say that the cant do what they love because they don't get good grades is just wrong. And I'm sure if pass this rule you will get a lot of unhappy calls from mad parents. Who knows, maybe parents will want you fired for what you have done. Now I think that rule would be really dumb, I mean so dumb, for real.

Also, since when did grades effect peoples ability to play sports? I'm not a fan of sports but i don't think that you cant play a certain sport just because your grades are low. Also, just not letting the kids who do bad do sports wont solve the low grade problems. Kids will still do bad because they are now mad because they cant do the sports they like.

The only thing that will improve the grade standard is if you either hope the kids realize that they need to get good grades, or get a bunch of new teachers that know how to teach the kids. Both of which will be very hard to do

You may be risking your carer and the amount of students that will want to go to the school. And why would you want to risk that? do us a favor and don't pass this stupid rule. You aren't gong to improve the schools grade average, you are just going to annoy a lot of parents and students. Also you could have picked a better writing prompt for me to do, this one is really not fun. And the fact that I had to write this with one hand, since I broke my other hand, is even more annoying.
