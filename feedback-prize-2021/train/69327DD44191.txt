Do you think students would benefit from being able to able to attend classes from home?.I think students learn better if they are hands on in the classroom. Students will have an hard time paying attention if the teacher is not there to get them back on tasks. They would get distracted and barely get work done. Some students may not be working as hard as they can because they could be hands on, which would not help if your listening to the teacher through the computer. Although some may believe students will benefit better by attending classes from home, students will perform better if they are hands on.

Students will have an hard time paying attention if the teacher is not there to get them back on task. The students may get bored and do other things. They might not have anyone to tell them to do their work,and possibly no authority at home. They may not pay attention because they lose focus and their friends could want them to go out with them instead of working.

Some students may not be working as hard as they can because they could be a hands on student. When your teacher is in the classroom talking with you and showing you the steps of the something it is easier to understand. When your at home there is no rules on how you do your work so a student could cheat and learn nothing. Students may not understand everything the teacher assigns to them and they're not going to be able to ask them questions all the time.

In conclusion, I think students learn better when they are being shown how to do the work in person. Usually, when your at home you don't feel like doing work or don't remember what the teacher said about a problem. So I would say it is best to do all the work you need to do in class so you can ask about anything your having trouble with. Students will get off task and need the supervision of someone telling them to do their work. Some students may not understand how the work on the computer is and get confused when it ask them something difficult.
