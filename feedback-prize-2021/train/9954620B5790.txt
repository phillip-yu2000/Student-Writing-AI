Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly support the idea of students having to do community service. If you make it a requirement to have community service it will help future graduates get into a better college of their choice. Occupation opportunity's will be given more to those who have done this helpful deed. Lastly, these students will be known and loved in and by the community for their time and effort.

Students start to think about college when they hit 6th grade. So that's seven years of stress that could be decreased by knowing they have community service to put on their college application. This will get students more aware and ready for their college future . Most colleges need some kind of curricular activity and community service so the best way to get that done with is to have that as a requirement to graduate high school.

After college students will be all on there own. To support themselves they'll need a job. Appling application after application could take these new adults forever to get a job if they didn't have community service to put on those applications. Your choice could effect hundreds of students jobs and how they will live for the rest of their life. For an occupation that pays the way to live needs people who have helped in a community. So lets give these future scholars a chance to make a living.

Our community would be destroyed without the help of those who give up their time to help. Small towns like ours need the small and big things done to keep it a town. The community would be overjoyed with community service by students.

In conclusion without the required community service our students will have problems in their life. With getting accepted into a college of their own choice. To getting a occupation that actually makes a decent living. Lastly, to help the community be a cleaner and more helpful place to be. I highly support and take the position of having to have community service required.
