Making hard desicions can be made easier by getting multiple opinions from other people. People who ask other people what their opinion is, can help that person decide on what he/she wants to do. Opinions can have good or bad things to say about the subject they are talking about, and opinions vary in manykinds of ways depending on the persons aspect of the subject. When people discuss about something in groups, they have multiple aspects that a person can take and see how the subject would be a good or bad idea. The way people see things will affect their opinions and aspects of their situation.

When someone is trying to find a reliable tool, they usaully look for the most rated items, because the higher the ratings are the most liked and most used. When somethin has low to no ratings, then that means that it is either not liked or not used. So my conclusion on one opinion means one aspect or idea about the subject, and multiple opinions mean more opinions which means more aspects or ideas about the subject.
