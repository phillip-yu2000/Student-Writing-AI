Dear, Principal,

I believe it should be required to perform community service. Performing community service brings many new advantages and perspectives to students. Students are also allowed to volunteer for a service program which they will enjoy. The experience provided through the volunteer work gives students new ideas and new insights on future jobs or even majors in college through experiences which will help students define their comfort zones in different working environments. I also assume that everyone should take their time to help the community.

Students have the advantage of choosing the service they may volunteer for. Most students volunteer in an environment they find safe and comfortable. An athletic student may volunteer to help coach children who play sports. Whilst a student who enjoys literature may volunteer at a library. Another student who enjoys working with children may volunteer at a daycare. There are wide ranges of programs available to suit each and every student's preference. Some students who do not enjoy their work may grow interested while working and decide to expand their knowledge for future reference.

The main idea behind community service is not to keep students busy but to introduce then to new working environments which may influence their decisions on job options or college majors and degrees. An intellectual student who is also known to be shy may find pleasure in working around people in nursing homes or other crowded environments. Community service allows students to expand their views on jobs of the community. I believe it should be required for all students to perform community service.

Sincerely,
