My argument against driverless cars, would be that first of all it would be really dangerous, many kids play outside how are the driverless cars going to see a young kid run across the street? Next is that yeah it might be gas saving but think about how much gas is already waisted in our world? lots plus, he saids in his artical " fundamentally change the world " or are these driverless robotic automoibles going to change the way people live today? think of themselfs not to good enough becusae you might not be able to afford these 'cars' or for the wealthy who knows he can buy tons of them feel way to good of themselfs? other words better than others in there point of view. plus many people bought many cars. WHAT are they going to do throw them away not many people going to automaticaly leave all these cars and right away move on to these driverless cars.
