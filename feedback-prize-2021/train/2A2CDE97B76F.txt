"Particapating in an extracurricular activities is required in this school." I disagree with the decison that every student must participate in one extracurricular activity. First of all, students may not have time to participate in extracurricular activities. Second, the student may not find an interest in any activities provided by the school. Lastly, some students may struggle with their grades. In conlcusion, students might not have the time, not have any interest in any activity, and having low grades are all reasons that extracurricular activities shouldn't be required.

First of all, students may not have time to participate in extracurricular activities. For example, a student may have to stay after school for extra help with assignments. Or, the student does alot participating with their religion. The student may find it hard to balance their activities through the day. All together, fitting all their day to day activities in one day could be hard for a student.

Second, the student may not find an interest in any activities provided by the school. Every student has different interest. One student may like sports, another music, or maybe even working on the yearbook. There could be students though that don't find interest in any of those activities. So, students shouldn't be forced to participate in any activilty they don't enjoy.

Lastly, some students may struggle with their grades. Some students may find it hard to keep their grade up. Alot of the time, the coach or teacher won't let students participate with low grades. The students low grades could get them kicked off their team or anything they are participating in. All in all, students grades could affect their participation.

I don't think students should be forced to particpate in any extracurricular activity. Not having time in the day, not having any interest in any of the activities provided, and having low grades are all reasons students shouldn't have to participate in extra activities.
