I do feel that this would be helpfull in a lot of classes. Not all the students understand the lesson all the time so they just dont do the work, but with this tool in the class room the computer would see that the student is not understanding and will change the lesson so thst eveyone gets it and is on task doing there work.

I dont feel that this should be used for anything else but to read students emotional expressions in class. This is helpful to the teacher aswell because not all the time do they see the ones that are not understanding what is going on because as long as most of the students are getting the esson they don't see the one's who are not. Most students who dont understand the work will not say anything and just sit there and look like they know what is going on but don't. So this will be good for picking them out so that they can get all the help they need. This is also good for when a teacher might feel like noone gets the work because of how the class looks even though they all understand it they just dont look like it the computer would let the teacher know that everyone is fine with the work and understands it.

In conclusion i do feel that this new technology would be good for all schools and that it would be a big help.
