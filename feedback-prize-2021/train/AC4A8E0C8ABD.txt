If you are considring becoming a sea going cowboy you should, and I have a few reasons why. My frirst reason is you get paid to travel and it makes a great learning oppertunity for adults to learn abot new cultures and races you will be able to do new hobbys, learn new resipes. Also you get to travel the world get to travel to the most beautiful places on earth including Greece, Italy, France and many more places. If you love animals you will be able to take care of them but the only down side of that is you have to clean there stalls

You may now be wondring If Im going to be taking care of animals twentey-four seven you would not have time to hae fun but dont worry you will have plenty of fun especially on the return trips you will enjoy baseballl, ,vollyball ,table-tennis fencing ,boxing ,reading ,and whittling. You will also once gotten to the destination have fun there and swim go ,boat rides, and see marvouls things.

In conlusion you see it is obvious that you should become a sea going cowboy. You will learn new things and vist many beautiful places and meet many interesting people from diffrent cultures and races.
