I dont't think that we should use the Facial Action Coding system in school. It's messing with the privacy of the kids who come into school and an ivasion on their personal space. I don't like the idea that a machine would be watching you and trying to find out how you are feeling.

There is a good side that I see to all if this as well too.

For example, it could be used to help a person who is depressed or really sad. It could help that person talk it out with someone and get the help they need, It can also catch a student while lying to a teacher. Despite these things, I still think it is like invading on someone elses privacy. It could also malfunction and say that the student is one thing but really isn't. Things like that could lead to alot of misunderstandings and confusion as well. It's okay to use it on objects like, paintings but, I don't think it would be such a good idea to use it on humans. A person's emotions is their own and not always needs shared with other people. If they want to express how they feel, then they will. If they don't then they don't. It's the student's choice. I don't think it would be fair to any of the students if it does become okay to use this. I wouldn't really feel comfortable that machine in the classroom at all.

In conclusion, I believe that this technology should not be used in schools or on people for that matter. I think that if we want to say how we feel then we do it ourselves. We shouldn't have to let a machine do it for us. I feel that it shoud only be used on objects. Even though it is a pretty neat machine, it still shouldn't be put in schools.
