In the year 1945, World war 2 has ended, With a long lasting war comes celibration, Joy, and freedom that has hid from the people for year's comes to spread joy accross the world. However there are sad things that come too, ruins. With war comes death, dispare, loss of hope, and ruins of what used to be a happy place to some people. The is a man named luke and a very large group of people are there to help.

Luke is a person who was influenced by a friend to join the so caled sea "cowboys" who help the broken countrys that were riped apart by war. However he went to many different places like eroupe and china and with that you get to see new places. After the animals dispatch from the boat, that will give the workers of the boat time to relax for a while because they will need to get ready to leave again. that mean's the workers have time to do whatever they want.

When the workers leave the animals to leave to thier new home they most likley have time to do somthing. Also if they are giding the animals by big towns you can most likley see the famous land marks or butifule sights on the way. to Luke it was a great experience.

The docs for a ship must have been near town's so the feel of being in a new place to you is a wierd but good feeling. Seing new places, historical land marks, new people, differnt costoms is wierd and different, but it is what is called home to alot of people. To be on a boat and sailng seas is a dream come true to luke, a one in a life time chance. It must have been a hard and dangerous journy is fun, but saying it was the best thing that ever hapend to you is somthing big, and even still saying that when you alomost die is still somthing.

So in all going around the world, sialing the sea, and helping people is a good feeling and to luke is the best feeling. Luke made the most trips as a sea cowboy. So his adventures were great and long but amazing.
