Driverless cars are coming to us soon, which means less driving. In the article, they say driverless cars will do the driving 90 percnt of the time. The only time the people will really have to drive is if there is tricky traffic or roads, and pulling in and out of driveways. For the most part, these driverless cars cover all of your driving other then that. This would be great for people that have to drive a lot for work and that are very busy. It would take a lot of stress and pressure off of teens or even adults that get easily frustrated or really serve road rage. If you aren't paying attention to the road when you are driving for whatever reason, then your car would technically be doing it for you. In case you miss something, or happen to almost run a red light, driverless cars would prevent things like that from happening! The article states that the car will pay attention to you just as much as you pay attention to it, and the roads. Which is great, because this will basically cover anything bad that could happen wihile driving like speeding, or running red lights, which means less tickets and getting pulled over. This also could really help out with less car accidents and save lives tremendously! A little help would never hurt with driving for everyone, or something there to keep an extra eye on you to be safe, because there are a lot of not-so-good drivers out there. Everyone will agree with that! Overall, driverless cars would be brilliant and do wonders for anyone at all who drives. Driveless cars could save you money, and or tickets/court, and lastly, even your life! These cars could change history even!
