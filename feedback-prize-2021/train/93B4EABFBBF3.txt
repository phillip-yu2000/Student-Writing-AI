Dear Principle,

I think that students should not be required to perform community service only because their principle says they have to. I think that community service does help the community but it does not have to be required by the principle. Students should only do community service if they choose to, not because someone is forcing them. I would not like it if someone is forcing me to work community hours only because it takes time off my schedule from doing what i want to do, and having to do something someone is making me do. I think I speak for most students by saying that it would not be fair to have someone make me clean up the community. and if i am going to help by doing community service, it will be on my time only, not by what someone is telling me because i have other things to do like having to be there for my baseball team or going to the mall or movies with friends and other fun stuff i want to do in my life. but if i was forced to do community service, i would no longer have the freedom to do those types of things. The same thing goes for every other student forced to do community service
