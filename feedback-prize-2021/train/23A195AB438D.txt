I believe that the use of this technology would be valuable to use in a classroom full of students. I believe this because instructors must know what their students emotions are like toward the subject being taught. For example, let's say a students emotion is bored, the taecher would then know what his students emotion is like. The instructor may be able to give a 2 to 5 minute survey to his students based on what he can do to improve his teaching skills. Which would therefor give his students a better environment to work.

The prompt explained a somewhat new computer software that could recognize emotions. It explains what the software can do and how it works. 'The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscle is called an "action unit."'(D'Alto), this quote talks about how it reads ones face emotion. Which brings us to a students emotion and how its read. This is where it is valuable, 'But if you frown, the next ad will be different. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming counfused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insstructor.'(D'Alto). This is where it is valuable this software, it will be able to tell an instructor their students emotion toward the subject and how they'll be able to improve/modify the lesson.

With this software many instructors would be able to improve on their lessons. Thanks to Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleage many students would be able to focus on their lesson and not be bored again. This is why I believe this technology would be a valuable use in a classroom full of students.
