Do you know what a Seagoing Cowboy is, After world war two was over many countries were left in ruin, so the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration UNRRA sent the ruined countries cows,horses and mules. The Seagoing Cowboys job was to take care of the animals that were shipped overseas. Luke Bomberger was a seagoing Cowboy who made eighteen trips as a seagoing Cowboy. I think that Luke Bomberg would want others to join the seagoing cowboys because, It could make you more aware of other countries, it is also fun and you get to experience other cultures.

I think that Luke Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get the oppertunity to go to other countries and experience them. In the text it says "Besides helping I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China." the text says that because of the Seagoing Cowboy job he had he was able to experience other cultures and countries.

Another reason I think that Luk Bomberg would want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys is because it makes you more aware of other countries. In the text it says " It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." If Luke Bomberg had not become a Seagoing Cowboy he would not have realized the needs of other countries and their people.

I also think that Luke Bomberg would want you to become a Seagoing Cowboy is because it can be fun. in the text it says " The cowboys played baseball and volley ball in the empty holds where animals had been." Once the animals were taken off of the boat the cowboys were able to play games and have fun.

What would you do, would you become a Seagoing Cowboy? Think of all the benefits like the sightseeing, the fun and the growth of your awareness of all the other people in the world.
