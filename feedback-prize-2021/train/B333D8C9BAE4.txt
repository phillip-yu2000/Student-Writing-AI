Studying the planet Venus is not the easiest task. The planet has very high surface temperature. They can be as high as eight hundred degrees fahrenheit. The planet also has high atmospheric temperatures. Along with these high temperatures, the planet has volcanoes and earthquakes.

Scientists have sent probes to Venus but lightning strikes them and can destroy them. Even though these have been destroyed, that does not men that we should stop sending them. Humans are filled with so much curiosity so we are not giving up yet. NASA has an idea that can allow scientists to hover the fray.

this woukld aloow us to explore the plaet and learn more about it while not losing equipment or human lives.

NASA'si dea is amazing, however there are some complications that are currently stoping them from pursuing this. Scientists would not have the clearest view of the planet from a safe distance. This woud make photographing the planet difficult. They also would be unable to take samles of the rock and other substances of the planets surface.

We should not let this get us down though. THese are onky chalanges that our very intelligent scientists will one day be able to overcome. There is so much that we do not know about this planet that is in our solar system. It is evident that our scientists reserch and invent technologies that will someday help us to view this planet and other planets as well. We shall not let fear and dangers get in the way or marvelous discoveries.
