Is it a good idea to have driverless cars? For me I don't think we should have driverless cars. For one it will be more dangerous. Second you will have less knowledge of cars when you think the car just drives by itself. Last you won't remember what to do and you'll panick when danger comes. That's why I think we shouldn't have driverless cars.

First, I think having driverless cars are really dangerous. One reason I think of that because you will not pay attention and you think that technology will take over. Technology isn't always the best source to trust. You can never trust technology because there will always be an error and the car will not work properly and the manufacture will be in alot of trouble for all the harm that has happen.

Second, you will have less knowledge with your vechile, when you think the car can do it all by theirselves. You will get to the point of being lazy and not worrying when danger comes because you won't worry about getting into danger when the car knows what to do. You will always rely on the vechile to do things for you and won't care what happens and you'll just blame it on the vechile and say it wasn't your fault even though it was part of your fault.

Last, you won't remember anything you learned and you will lack knowledge. When that comes you'll panick and be confuse when you don't know something. When danger comes you won't know what to do and you will panick and get into an accident. Most drivers won't care about safety because they will think its a driverless car that they don't need to know anyhting it will do eveything for them.

That's why I think we shouldn't have driverless cars. For one it will be more dangerous. Second you will have less knowledge of cars when you think the car just drives by itself. Last you wont remember what to do and you'll panick when danger comes. Do you really think we should have driverless cars?
