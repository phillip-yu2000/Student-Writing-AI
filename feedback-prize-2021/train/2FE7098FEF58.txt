Humans can detect what people are feeling why can't computers? The use of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in the classroom would be beneficial because "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This could be a serious asset in the classroom and it helps the student learn effectively.

The problem in today's world is students get lost and give up when they get bored and confused. They start to slack off. With this kind of technology it could help the student to stay on task and have fun while doing it. The type of technology that Dr. Huang developed could change the way students learn. This technology is personalized to the person using it. "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional comminication. So computers need to understand that too." This quote perfectly shows how our technology is advancing and that the upcoming students would benefit from having these types of computers.

In conclusion, I would say that technology that could detect human emotions would be useful to students. Useful to everyone really. The FACS could take learning and computers to a whole new universe.
