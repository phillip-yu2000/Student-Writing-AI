Dear principal,

I think we should be able to have cell phones during lunch periods or free time. Sometimes they could be really helpful, like if we forgot something we could just call our parents and ask them to bring it. I like being on my cell phone a lot. because of the free internet on it. Like if we need help on some things for homework or a project and we want to get working on it, cell phones could help us. Or if you need a ride home, that's if there's a problem like being sick, or anything else. It would be nice to call our parents straight from our phones to pick us up.

Sometimes when i' m at home using the internet for writing something out, i use my cell phone during that time to help me concentrate. Or when i' m in my language arts class my teacher lets me use our ipods for writing to help us concentrate more. It really does help me i do like it, it gives me time to think but also have music going on, or to give me more of an idea like one song could help me set the mood to the subject i' m writing about or give me more of an idea about it.

Most school's in America are banning phones from school's, because there using them to take pictures of people or video's of students. I hate that most kids now and day's are using them for bad things, or just to get a laugh out of something that's really not even that funny. When it could really hurt someone's feelings, it would be a whole lot better if they were banned. But it still wouldn't be fair for the kids who don't use them in bad ways and just for texting or other such necessary things.

I hope you do improve this idea, and think more about it. And that this is enough information to convince you too like the idea. It would be nice to have phone's in our school, and still be able to use them.
