I am going to write an essay on why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because it gives you a lot of opportunities to see different places.

You can go visit some of the most exciting places in the world.

Also if you like animals it gives an opportunity to take care of them.

If you have never gone over seas then there is your opportunity. You travel all over the world, go over the seas, and oceans. You get to adventure the seas, oceans, and the world. Also if you are a young Seagoing Cowboy and you still need to attend school the you can learn about the countries and seas by exploring them.

Like I said earlier if you still need to attend school you can learn different languages because you are exploring the world. So by learning diffenrent languages it can open up many opportunities for you. But it doesn't need to be all about learning. You can play games on the way and see many different sites that's the whole world would want to see. Then when you come back you can tell all your friends about the trips you have had. Then maybe they would like to come along with us.

In conclusion that is why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy to have those many adventures.
