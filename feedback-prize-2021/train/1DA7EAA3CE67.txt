Dear principle

I think you should let students bring there cell phones to school cause what if in a emergency happens. I know what your thinking they could just go to the front office and use the phone there. Wrong what if the power goes off and the front office phones are down. then what. By the way i think you should let them have there phone on all day cause what if an family emergency. You know and i know even those kids know you anit gona be able to stop them from bringing them any way so you should just let them bring them and let them use it on there free time. Instead of going through all that time and wasting breath. just give us the first policy. i know what your thinking there gona take advantage of it and you know what they might and if so just band cell phones for like a week or so and if they bring it within that week and if they get caught just take up there phone. But still you should not ban phones from school.
