Dear principle of SCHOOL_NAME,

I, STUDENT_NAME , who is representing the students of SCHOOL_NAME, believe that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school, as long as the phones are turned off during their class session.

I don't really like parts of this policy, but I'm more on allowing students to bring their cell phones to school because, the other policy is just too harsh. Students will just think about their cell phones all day, and they won't be able to pay attention on their school work. They to relax once a while, but not too much relaxing. If their is an emergency and the school phones are not working, students need a portable phone that does not need wires to contact help.

I, STUDENT_NAME, have looked over, and thought about both policies, and I have come to a conclusion. Students of SCHOOL_NAME Should be allowed to bring cell phones to school, as long it is turned off during their class session.
