I am against the development of these cars because those who own one would never know if the the car would stop working and will crash. Also waiting fo the driver to take its part too when driving, Although having a driverless car would be dangerouse to those who own one and the community.

Having a driverless cars would be a good idea but can cause an acciendent. In the text, it states that, "Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover libability in the case of an accident." If those who owns a driverless car got into a acciendent the new law would have to order to cover the damage. Also by having a diverless car, if the car have stop functioning well, it would cause someone to get injured. An example from the text is, "If tecnology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer." Having that car, those wouldn't know who to blame. Driverless cars can cause problems so it wouldn't be a good idea owning one.

Those who are thinking or has a driverless car can get into problems that they aren' aware of. Those people can cause an accident and can be dangerous to those around them and themselves.
