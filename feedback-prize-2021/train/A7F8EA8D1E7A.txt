What is Facial Action Coding system? A Facial Action Coding System is computers that will help identify human emotions. For example say the person is 85 percent happy 7 percent disgusted and 4 percent fearful and 0 percent angry. Some new computer softaware can recognize emotions. I am for the value of using the technology to read students emotional expressions.

The process beigns when the computer constructs a 3 D computer model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move helps human muscle. For example your '' frontailis pars lateralis muslce above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you are suprised your orbicaularis oris around your moth shows your lips to show anger.

Onther reason is facial excpressions for each emotion are universal says Dr. Huang. Second using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements. Last it bring a smile to your face while its shows just much the computer can do.

This is the reason why i think the FACS is a great idea because it can help kids tell when they are sad or happy. Helps them shows there true feelings. THE END!!!!
