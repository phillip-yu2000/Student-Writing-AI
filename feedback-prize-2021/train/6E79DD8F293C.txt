Dear Principal,

I believe that the policy for cell phones in the schools should be for students to be allowed to bring phones to school and to be allowed to use them in lunch periods and other free times. I believe this because in our society today, easier communication has become a necessity, and I cannot see any apparent reason on why phones should have forbidden use in times of the day were students are allowed to talk and enjoy themselves. School is a place for learning, but in free times of the day students should be allowed to listen to music, cell phones, etc.. Allowing students to have cell phones in free periods and lunch would give the student body a higher respect for the staff and faculty of the school for giving them the privilege to have there cell phones with them in free times, and I believe that this would result in more courtesy and respect in the student body towards staff, faculty, and each other. I do not disagree with students to have forbidden use of there cell phones during class because it would get in the way of a student's education, and this could result in bigger problems later on in there lives. the student body on it's part should not have a disregard for cell phone use in class, and should respect and honor the privilege given to them. If cell phone use is given to students in free times of the day, I believe the student body can uphold its part, and this would definitely result in a better community in the school. Thank you.

Sincerely,

A fellow student
