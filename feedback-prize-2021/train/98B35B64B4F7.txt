I believe that this technology is very usueful. This technologhy would be so amazing to have around, it would help students and teachers out so much. it can tell when you are bored, happy, sad, scared, worried, and can even tell when you do not like an ad. It could really help out in classrooms and other places.

For example, if you are sitting in class and you are doing something online, the computer can tell if you are bored and adjust itself so you are more into what is going on, or the teacher can come over and help you out too. It could also sense when you do not like an ad, all you have to do is smile or frown at the ad, if you smile you should get more ads like it, but if you frown it will try to find an ad you will be interested in.

Another example would be if your friends are worried about you because they cannot tell how you are feeling, then they can put you in front of a computer and the computer can tell them your mood so they can try to help you, or if you are going to see a therapist for help with a mental issue or anything, they could set you in front of a computer so they know your mood without you trying to explain yourself to them.

One final example would be if you are worried or stressing out about something, the computer could tell someone so they can take you somewhere so you can just chill and relax and forget about everything that you are stressed or worried about, then you will be able to go back to whatever you were doing and complete it.

This unique piece of technology can help out with so many things. It can tell when you are upset, scared, worried, angry, and bored. Every classroom should have one of these. It would make being able to read people so much easier. It would also keep the students interested.
