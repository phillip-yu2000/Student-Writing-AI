The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because long ago Venus was once like Earth. In the text it states "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." The author may not be the only one that thinks studying Venus isn't a bad idea because Astronomers are fascinated by it.

Now there is quite a bit of danger when it comes down to studying Venus.

The temperature gets really hot on Venus. In the text it states " On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." That can not be good for the human body. Venus has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide blankets and sulfuric acid clouds.

Also, in the text it states "such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." I don't know how good of idea this could be because according to the passage " ...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades." Now just imagine what it would do to a human without the proper gear on.

Than, again they might think it's a good idea to see if their is ife outside of Earth. This could possibly happen in the near future. I don't think the scientists or the author care about the danger that could possibly happen. In the text it states " Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

In conclusion, studying Venus is a huge risk. It could possibly take years or decades until a decision is made, or until the proper equipment is invented. Either way studying Venus has its cons and pros.
