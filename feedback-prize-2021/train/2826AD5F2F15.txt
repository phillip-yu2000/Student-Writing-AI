The author uses a lot of clear evidence to discribe how the scientists are tring to study Venus. Also, the author discribes the dangers of doing so. The author also tells us what the problems are with studing Venus. The real question is, is it really worth it?

One of the biggest problems with exploring Venus is that Venuses aptnosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide and the timperatures average over 800 degrees. Another problem is that the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than here on earth. Also Venus is some times mistaken for a star because the plannet is so bright.

At one point Venus would have had features just like earth and have water surounding it. Venus is also known as the the twin to earth because they are so similar in features. NASA would send shipes into space and go to Venus but they could never lang on Venus. They haven't had a succesful space travel to Venus in 30 years. NASA is thinking about sending a blimp like craft to venus and have it hover over Venus at like 30 miles off the ground. Even at 30 miles off the ground the tempurtures will be around 170 Fahrenheit.

With what the passage states it is safe to say that there are a lot of dangers NASA would have to address before they launch another space ship to Venus. But also there are a lot of possibilities that NASA has when they launch the space ship to Venus. NASA can be the ones who discovered Venus, also they could learn more about Venus and why it lost all its earth like features.

In conclusion, the idea of learning more about Venus is a great opportunity to learn more about the planets around us. Also, learning about how Venus lost the Earth like features is a good way to learn about our planet and how to keep Earth from becoming that way. This idea of risking everything to go and explore Venus is a great opprtunity for us at earth to learn about how other planets like ours were destroyed.
