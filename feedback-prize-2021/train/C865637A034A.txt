Students would benefit attending school from home in many ways.... students would be able to work in a quiet environment with no distractions from other students. Another reason why it would be better would be because, some students work in their own speed and won't be worried about how fast others finish. Sometimes students are more focused on who finishes first and sometimes think it's a race. students would also have the chance of working on their own time when they can,like that students could proprobly finish their work faster. Online school could also be better for students sleep schedule, like that students could be more rested and would be able to focus on their work.

Better sleeping schedule would help kids focus more on their work and would be able to stay up, whens students dont sleep well the tend for fall asleep in class. Falling asleep in class effects on class grades because student pay less attention. Having to wake up early and get ready on time is hard work,making it on time to school is a big task. Just having online classes from home would be better for everyone in general, would honestly make students life much more easier. Online school should just be a thing for students because its less stressful and much easier.
