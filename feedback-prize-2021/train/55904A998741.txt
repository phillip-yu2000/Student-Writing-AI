Dear Principal

I send you this letter because i would like to discuss with you about changing the schools policy on not being able to participate in sport and actives unless you have a average of an A or B. I think this is wrong because so many children have problems with their work or might have a disability of learning, which cause them to get a lower grade.

children should have equal opportunities to participate in any activities or sport just so they wont feel as if they aren't worthy enough to do be successful just like every one else. If you do change this think about all the other children who are left out, they try just as hard as the rest of the children and it would be unfair to them that the aren't able to do anything, only being able to watch. I just come to you say that this is a very big mistake your making an i think you should see for your self how hard these children try and how hard it is for them to learn and be just like all of the rest of the children... Think about what your going to do before you do it. Most of the student only make C' s try to include them.

I could understand if they had only flawed grades which means their not trying hard enough but the ones who are should have every right to join in on the most fun they might ever have in a lift time. I myself have talked to some of the kids in school an they also agree with me not because they think its stupid but because they have bad grades them self's and are working as hard as they can.

The children of this school are wonderful and i wish you would just listen to what all of us are trying to say when i tell you that this is a wrong thing to do for the school and that you should listen to the kids opinions more often then not. Why should the children suffer for the lack of their grades? then to be able to enjoy their middle school year WITHOUT having to force them self's to work harder.
