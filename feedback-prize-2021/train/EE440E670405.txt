Dear Principal,

Not being able to do sports or other activities if you don't have a B average or higher is not fair. What happens to the kids who do really well on other tasked, but when it comes to a project that they don't get, and they are to shy to ask for help. So the teacher gives them a bad grade and that brings their average down to a C, and lets say that they are really good at volleyball. It's the last day before the big game so you mean to tell me that the can't play in the big game because they got a C in a class because they didn't understand a project. Well if the coaches don't say anything i know i would.

Lets say we have UIL coming up and this actor gets a C in one of her classes, well for one she is not failing and two she is the main actor. You being in charge are going to take her out of the play and make her stay here because she has a C. That means you are willing to take a chance at getting a huge title and letting fall out of your hands because you took the main part way and handed it to someone else who has to learn her lines in less than one day because that girl couldn't come cause she had a C. That's just sad that you would waste a perfectly good title cause of one girls little mistake.

I also think that a C still deserves to be raised by letting that student have a chance to make up what they missed. By doing that they are still able to do what ever they singed up for and hopefully help out your school by winning something for you. I say that if that person has to suffer because of a C why not do something about the D,F, and other grades that seem to have no effect on those peoples lives while they work.

Sincerely,

your student
