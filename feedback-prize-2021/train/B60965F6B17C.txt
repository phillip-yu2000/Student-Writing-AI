Dear principal,

I think that all students should have to do some kind of community service over the course of the year. If the students do they could receive a prize or something if they choose to do community service. Some community service that they could is that they could pick up liter on the side of a road or help people cross a street or carry their groceries to their car.

The students could have a required amount of time to community service every week or month. So then if they do all of their hours on one day then they have the whole rest of the week to do what they want to do for themselves. If the students do help the community then the community would give positive feed back about our school making a change in the community.

Those that have more than so many hours of the year should be able to go on a field trip for making a change in the community. Those that don't have to stay with all the rest of the kids that didn't and do class work. We could start a contest within the school and in the district. The school contest could be whoever has the most hours gets to be the principal for a whole week and the principal gets a week of vacation. The district contest could be that which ever school has the most community service hours gets a cash prize or something.

That's what I think we could do to help encourage students to volunteer to do community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
