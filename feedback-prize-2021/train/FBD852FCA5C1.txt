Dear principle,

I really don't think that making students do community service should be made a school requirement. Maybe a better thing that you can try to do with community service is maybe make a sign up sheet where all the students that actually want to help people and actually want to help their community can just sign up to do their community service to help. In my personal opinion there is no point on making students that don't want to help people or their community do community service at all unless they do something that is actually bad and have no other choice. The reason for why I think this way is because they probably won't even do a good job when doing it, won't feel good about them helping, and will just see no point in doing the community service that they have done. Also sometimes they have something that they absolutely have to do at their house or maybe it can be as simple as having to go somewhere that had a very important reason. Community service, it takes up your time and its usually from stuff that maybe they have been planning from maybe even a really long time ago and have been looking forward to this for a long time. Homework can also be an issue here sometimes. Maybe because they had to go to perform their community service thing they had to miss doing their homework or just didn't have time to do their best, and when kids sometimes miss their homework or just don't do their best in class, it can really drop their grade down by ALOT. Now I know you don't want community service or anything to come in the way of having a good education. So that is my personal opinion on the community service that you are planning on making a requirement and the really good reasons for my opinion.

sincerely,

student
