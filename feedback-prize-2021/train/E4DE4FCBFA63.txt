Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

This is STUDENT_NAME saying that i think it is ridiculous to change the sports policy to a C average. I have gotten support by this idea from many students who play sports for the school. I have done some studying on most of the student grades and most students at our school are making low C' s - high B' s. I don't think this new policy is fair because we will lose amazing players that make C+ average. It is possible that We will lose a lot of students on our campus as well. I think that we should at least discuss this issue with the students who participate with school sports. I have also taken study on other school websites and most of their sport requirements are high C' s. Most of us here at SCHOOL_NAME really do think that you are taking this to far. Even some of the teachers are agreeing on my input, they have all signed my partition on lowering the policy. Please TEACHER_NAME, except our agreement on what we students of SCHOOL_NAME say. It would really make myself, my peers and the teachers here very happy.

Thank you,

Your students.
