To Principal

CLICK!.. Everyone loves texting and I'll tell you why. Fact everyone loves phone for communication so students should be allowed to bring phones to school and be able to use them during lunch periods, because student usually have to call their parents to talk to them about something important or something that happen in school or who knows kids are more aware of telling there parents then anyone else. It's also safe because something can happen during school or outside school, but it's also important to keep phones turned off to not bother the class. When other students are learning it may be a distraction to others and can be a big issue to others, and students should not be allowed to talk on the phone in class unless he or she is allowed by a teacher, it can keep students of track, so it is better for students to talk out of class and not inside class, but I think its more safe to let students to use phones during a free time or during lunch time, because students might text during class, students are more safe with communication by their sides and gives of more reasons to let phones be out. So let us keep CLICKING CLICKING for sometimes good news and some times bad times. Policy 1 gives of more reasons to be allowed students to be able to text then Policy 2 which Policy 1 gives reasons like the ones I gave in these paper.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
