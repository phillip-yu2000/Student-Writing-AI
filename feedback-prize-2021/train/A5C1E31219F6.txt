Decreasing car usage would serve as a benefit to our communities and enviorment. Many countries are already being influenced by the new trend. As proven that without cars we could provide ourselves with cleaner air, physically healthier bodies and a more pleasant social atmosphere.

With the purchase of a car comes the consequences to our only enviorment. In "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars", it is shown that "Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50% in some car-intesive areas in the United States". If we started to limit car usage these numbers could drop giving us cleaner air to breathe and a longer lasting enviorment. Some heavily populated cities such as Beijing, China are so polluted that there is a smog covering the entire city. The thick, grey cloud over Beijing is caused primarily by the greenhouse gas emissions from cars and various other pollution sources. Not only is Beijing to be held accountable but also cities in Europe such as Paris. From source 2, "Paris bans driving due to smog", it is said that "Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals", because of the over usage of diesel fuel vehicles Paris had to put a hault to motorists for a few days. If Parisians were not complient with the ban they were fined with 22Â€.

Giving up your vehicle for a day or two may seem like an impossible task but if you were not to have it there would be health benefits. We created the car for a reason, to get places quicker, safer, and more efficiently. Now that we successfully done that and have been doing it for quite some time, we have become much too dependent on them. I'm not saying to completely give up the usage of our beloved vehicles but just become more aware of when and where to we use them. If people used their cars a little less and started walking places, biking, skateboarding, etc. we would have a much healthier community. People wouldn't be so lazy or unfit and it would create a more sociable community.

Limiting car usage would enhance the idea of being social with your friends, family, a neighbor, or anybody for that matter. You could see more people walking down the street as opposed to being inside a car with a limited number of people. It would break down barriers of being afraid if you are walking alone, instead you'd have plenty of around who are mostly aware of their enviorment.

Car usage should be decreased a bit more than it is now for a better community and enviorment. We only have one planet and we should do as much as possible to try and keep it as clean as possible for as long as possible.
