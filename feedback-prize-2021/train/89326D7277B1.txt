Dear, SCHOOL_NAME Principle

I am writing this letter to you to inform you that some of the students at school are not liking you' r idea of community service. They disapprove because they all think its a waste of time and they have better things to do. I have spoken to a few of the students telling them that it would be great for our environment and community it can make a big difference. My opinion on this thought of your's is a brilliant idea I really want to help out. But to be honest if the students don't agree to do this don't punish them at least the people who went will be happy for them selves and fill good about there selves. I know I will be happy and extremely excited to help out!

Please reply to this letter stating the date, time, and place that we will hold this magnificent idea of your's at. Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
