Have you ever asked multiple people for advice because I know I have. Some reasons why you should ask multiple people for advice is you get different types of advice to choose from. You also get to choose the best advice for you,and if you ask multiple people for advice you have a better chance of choosing the right advice.

I think you should ask multiple people for advice because you get different types of advice. If you have different types of advice then you have more advice to choose from. If you only ask one person for advice there advice could be completely wrong. But if you have more advice to choose from you get the best advice for you. so if you only get advice from one person and you dont like the advice that they gave you then go and ask more people for advice.

If you ask multiple people for advice you have so many more chances to get the right advice for you. But if you dont ask multiple people for advice then I think you should consider doing it. Because I asked for advice on how to beat a level to a video game and I asked my little brother for advice and his advice did not work. Then I asked all of my friends for advice and none of there advice worked. But then I asked my older brother and his advice worked and I was so happy and i realized that I had to ask so many people for advice to beat this level and only one of there advice worked. So if you ask multiple people for advice try the advice and if it does not work dont give up and keep trying just ask more people for advice.

Overall I would definitely ask multiple people for advice because it gives you more advice to choose from,you can choose the best advice for you,and if you ask multiple people for advice then you have a better chance of finding the right advice.
