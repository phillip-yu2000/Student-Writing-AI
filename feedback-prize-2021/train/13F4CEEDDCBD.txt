Dear Principal,

Dear principal I believe that students should bring cell phones to school. Why? simply because they are a important part to our daily life. Cell phones do not hurt anyone's education as long as the cell phones are turned off during class time. If cell phones are turned off then students wont be focusing on their cell phones. It would be nice to let students use their cell phones during lunch or during their free time. If students use their cell phones during their lunch then the students wont want to use them during class time because they already used their cell phones during lunch.

Students bring cell phones too school all the time! Telling students not to bring cell phones isn't going to stop them. So why not just let them bring their cell phones to school with the condition making them turn their cell phones off during class time but letting students use their cell phones during lunch periods or even their free time. If the principal lets students use their cell phones during their free time maybe students will get rid of the egger to use their cell phones during class.

If cell phones are off during class then students wont have the erg to use their cell phones. This simply means that studets wont focuse on there cell phone but their educational time. Students should also follow the rules of having their cell phones turned of
