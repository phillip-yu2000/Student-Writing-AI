There are many arguments as to why these new "driverless" cars can be helpful to society. Although, there can also be problems that come with driverless cars. My position on these new-age cars and technology will be explained in the following paragraphs.

I presonally believe that using autonomous cars in the world is very far-fetched. It's a concept that doesn't seem probable to me, and I don't exactly understand it. There are so many problems that are present with these cars. Things malfunction and don't work correctly with technology all of the time. Having these cars than run using a large amount of technology like sensors, the LIDAR system-which creates a viewing field for the car-and much more, it is very possible that one small thing in any of these systems could go wrong, causing an accident. Another thing that has to be taken into consideration is that when an accident does occur, who is to blame-the driver or the manufacturer? That problem alone causes much controversy over driverless cars.

However, there is a large difference between driverless cars and driver-assisting cars. I have a much different opinion on cars that assist the driver in a situation. This technology can be very useful to drivers. For example: there's antilock brakes that are very advanced today that use sensors to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids. This technology is very helpful, making it easier for drivers that are in danger to prevent losing control on the road, injuring themselves, or potentially even death. In this situation, what would a driverless car do? It is very possible that this car would know how to react to such a situation and could cause a dangerous crash.

In conclusion, I personally do not agree with the idea of driverless cars at all. There are too many dangers that come along with this technology. I prefer to be behind the wheel, controlling my car, and knowing what it will do. That is my position on autonomous cars.
