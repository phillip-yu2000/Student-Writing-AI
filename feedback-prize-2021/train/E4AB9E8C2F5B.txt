My Position on driverless cars is i am not for driverless cars at all. Driverless cars are another thing that will make this country become more lazy and more careless. Sergey Brin the cofounder of google believes it will changes the world fundamentally, no this will not again this will make the whole lazy and careless and say they get in a an accident who do you blame the car the driver the padestrian? Driverless cars will make The world not a better place but a place where everyone is too obese or lazy to do anything. Driverless cars are also verry dangerous as well as stupid.

Driverlesss cars are dangerous becuase you wont know what to expect from the car. You wont know if the car will make a wrong turn break down out of no where,shut off completely or maybe even blow up at some point. Driverless cars are also very dangerous becuase they will not no what to do with all the oil they may not need any more, where are you gonna get rid of it , dump it in a river, ocean; no absolutely not. This is also not gonna be benefitical to gas companies or the goverment because where does all the money that we will usually spend on gas go that will go the goverenment, it will go to our familes and friends and be able to buy nice stuff for ourselves and not have to pay the government who already doesnt benefit the United States of America.

Driverless Cars are pointless and will not give us any benefits for our lives.

Again, My opinion is Driverless cars are very pointless and the will not benefit the US. It will only be destructive and a waste of time. It will also be another reason Americans will soon become obese and lazy, more than it is now. Finally, Whats your opinin about this?
