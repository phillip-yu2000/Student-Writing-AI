When People ask for advise they some times talk to more than one person because they want more than one opinion on a subject. Seeking multiple opinions can help the person deeply under the subject and have a good opinion on the subject. One example is if your getting ice cream and you want to find out which flavor is the most popular you can start by asking a group of people what their favorite ice cream flavor is by listing different choices of flavors.

Another example is if you have group of people and you want to know what their favorite holiday is then you can list holidays that are popular and many people enjoy the you can try to find out which one has the most favorites.

Another example is favorite season you get another group of people who like specific seasons like spring and summer fall winter. One more example is favorite food like pizza, hot dogs, steak, french fries, and chicken tally up the points and which ever one has the most points is the favorite.

The main reason to ask some one for advice is so you know what is most wanted by others and not just your self and seeking opinions about something is better than just using your own opinion. This is why I would go around and ask others what their opinions are befor I make a decision.
