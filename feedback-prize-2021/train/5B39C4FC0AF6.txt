I believe that the Facial Action Coding System is quite useful because it could keep the students interested and more willing, plus it could help students learn to become more happier.

This could detect how you're feeling and keeps you in interest. It could change the topic you're looking at or it could stop showing that ad you're getting sick of. If you are showing mixed interest, it could show you a different topic to keep you interest and want to learn more.

It helps us learn more about our facial features, like how all 44 major muscles help the model knows what expressions to detect. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

Also could detect what is fake and what is not, you could save lives be detecting who is really happy and who is faking it. The intentions are great and it helps alot along the way. If someone is really sad but fake a smile, then people could help that person start to become happy. Also it could help to teach you how to get out of a rut and not stay in one.

All in all, I do believe that the FACS is a great and useful and reliable is very valuable because you could change so many lives. It has all these great details ans helps you better in the long run. Students could have more interest in school and have better ways to stay up and awake during school, find new interests and grow much more. They could make even more, like reading someones mind, wouldn't that be amazing!
