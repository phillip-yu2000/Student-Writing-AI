I believe policy 1 is a good policy because if we don't have the privilege to use our phones then we actually will text during class or whisper during class too. Some teachers say its a bad thing to let students use their phones or electronics during free periods, but in reality if we don't have the privilege we will do trickery and do it any way without the teachers privilege. I am not saying this just cause I am a student, but because I see teachers getting mad at the students for doing things they should already had time doing before or after class. I see a lot of students texting instead of reading and doing the same thing when the teachers back is turned or not paying attention. It makes me mad at the student for being so mindless and the teacher for not caring. But if we did have the privilege of using our phones then we could say what we need to say and be done with it. Also i don't like the idea that the principle would not let students bring their phones to school because 1. How would we get home if we could not call for a ride?

2. Picture this scenario, a girl is walking in front of you and no one else is around, then all of sudden a guy comes in his car and kidnaps her? And the nearest police department is about 100 miles away from your school, and you have no phone to call for help cause the school BANED IT! what will you do then?

these are some reasons its important to have and/or use the phone during free periods and not expel them. This was my letter thank you for your attention and this concludes my speech.
