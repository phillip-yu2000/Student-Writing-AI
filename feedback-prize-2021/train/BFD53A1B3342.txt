the student will have to work hard than they are because the principal want her school to have a good grade in a over all as a school that why she said that they need to have a b grade average to play sports because the kids want to play sport more than ever thing so they will work as hard as they do on the field that they are playing on .Kid sent more time outside then they are doing home work they are just want to go out side to play then do what they need to do in school so that they can be what they are trying to become in life that why the principal want them to have a b grade average to play sports at there school and the other activities that they have at school.

but they will have to work hard and they not think that they can get a good grade in there class because they just want to play in the sports .so they think that it a passing grade so i can play on the football team you think are not doing your best in class just getting a ok grade in class when you put your name on that paper you need to hand to your best work every time that you hand in your work so that a good idea that the kid need a good grade so they can get a good grade average for high school or collage that why the principal need to change the average to a b or better .
