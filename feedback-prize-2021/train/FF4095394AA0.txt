Instead of having the Elcetoral College you should change it to the popular votes because the people vote for who they want as president not for who will be put in as president. It should be all about the people and what they want and who they want as the leader of the country not who the Electoral College puts in the office. Also the Electoral College is a process not a place but their are people that run the Electoral College and they put in who they want and not who the people want.

The counting of the electoral votes is done by Congress. Also the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. "In Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, youd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry." The votes would go to be electoral votes instead of what the people. Someone can be voted in to office by the peoples vote but it has to be that the other person might get in by the electoral votes instead of the individual votes.

The electoral vote overrule the peoples votes. For example "Obama received 61.7 precent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percentof the popular votes cast for him and Romney." It just is not fair for the people to vote for who they want as president and the Electoral College puts who they want in instead who people want in office. The people want who they want not who you put in office. In the state of Florida there are 29 electoral votes, Texas there are 38, California has 55.

These are reasons why the Electoral College should be changed to the election of the popular votes. It is only fair to do that instead of having it as someone that the people did not want in office. The electoral votes do not have to be there they just have them to put who Congress want in office. They do not care about the people they care about themselves.
