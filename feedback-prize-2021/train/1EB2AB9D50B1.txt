Did you ever wonder if limiting car usage is a good idea?

Limiting car usage can be a good idea in some ways. Some ways limiting car usage could be a good idea is by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, clearing the air of pollution, saving time, conserving rescources, and improving safety.

To start off, limiting car usage can be good in many ways. For example, by limiting car usage we could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. According to Source 1:

In

German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

, paragraph 5 says that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some areas in the United States. That is alot. With that amount of greenhouse gas gone,

the air can be cleaner.

In addition, limiting car usage can also be a good idea for clearing the air from smog and pollution. For example, in Source 2:

Paris bans driving due to smog

, a law was enforced to help clear the smog and pollution. On Mondays, people with even numbered licence plates could not drive. If they decided to drive they were given a fine of 31 dollars. This ban helped clear congestion by 60 percent in the capital of France.

Thirdly, the limiting of car usage could conserve rescources. If people do not drive we could save gas and oil to use it for something other than cars. People would also save money by not having to by gas or oil.

To conclude, limiting car usage could be good in many ways. If we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, clear the air of smog and pollution, or even conserve our rescources, we should limit our car usage.
