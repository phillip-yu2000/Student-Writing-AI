Have you ever wondered if driverless cars would actually work? Or if you would be safe in them? I believe that driverless cars would work and would be safe to an extent. I also believe that the taxis are going to go up a little to build more of these cars.

In the text it says that Google cars had worked in specfic conditions since 2009, but they also won't work in certain conditions such as construction zones,etc. The cars will have the driver take over while in construction zones or by accidents. The cars, majority of the time, are driverless which would make the driver lazy and not have to worry as much as he/she would if they were manually driving the car.

The article says that their cars have driven over than half a million miles without a crash, but what if they do? What if they dont alert the driver in time to take over and they crash? No one can be certain that they won't crash eventually. Another thing that the article said was that the Google car would use half the fuel of today's taxis, which is good, but what about the cars that aren't driverless? And aren't the taxis going to go up if we decide to make more driverless cars for everyone?

So do we know if they'll work properly or if they are safe enough yet? No we don't really know. No matter what we build or do the taxes are going to go up, and I still believe that we don't know if they're completely safe or not. I do see our society increasing towards more and more technology each day, and it would'nt surprise me if we do have driverless cars someday. Right now would not be a good time or even a few years from now wouldn't be a good time. So I guess the question is, What do you think about having a driverless car in the future?
