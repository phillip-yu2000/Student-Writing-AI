Dear,Senator

The United States Of America should change the voting of the president to popular vote. popular vote gets to see what the citizens of the United States want not just the 538 electors. They should change it to popular vote because it gets to see what the people want and we cant control who the electors vote for.

The president should be picked by the people because whoever wins the presidency is in charge of us. In the passage "What is the electoral college" it says "The electoral college consists of 538 electors". That means 538 people get a say in who they want the president to be not the many citizens. We all should get a vote because if the electors are the only ones who get to pick then the popular vote is useless.

Another reason why we shuold use only popular vote is because the electors dont always choose the president that their state wants. There only been a couple incidents of this happening but its possible. In the article"the indefensible electoral college:why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong" it says "Can voters control who their electors vote for? Not always". That is saying that theres always a possibility that your electors does not vote for what the state wants. Thats not right so they should change it to popular vote.

The citizens of the united states should have direct votes to the election of our presidents. Thats why You should change to popular vote. We get to see what the citizens want and we cant always trust our electors.
