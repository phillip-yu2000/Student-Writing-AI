Despite the risk and harmful factor of Venus, it is still possible to be survivable for humans. Once upon arrival, NASA concludes that "air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth" making it relate more to human life on earth. Venus would be toasty, considering the tempature on but there is still ablities for human survival.
