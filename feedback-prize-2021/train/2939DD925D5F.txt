Dear Principal,

From what my teachers have told me you are deciding whether all student should participate in community service. I believe that all students should engage in community service. I believe student should participate for two reason. the first reason is it would give the students something constructive to do after school. The second reason is the students may find a way to make new friends.

First, students should participate in community service because it gives them something constructive to do after school. Most students want to go home after a long day at school. The students will go home and do their homework and watch their favorite television show. instead of doing these lazy activities, they could help better their community.

Doing simple thing like babysitting, walking neighborhood dogs, and helping people do everyday tasks could help their communities in a great way. Doing these activities may help them see problems in the community. If the students see the problems themselves then they would be more likely to help fix the problem instead of just sitting idly by, making the problem worse.

Second, students should participate in community service because they may make new friends. People like to do different things with their free time. Getting involved with community service could actually be a way to find something new that the student would enjoy. Someone with different interests would be able to find an activity that they enjoy. hanging out with people that have the same interest would help a student make new friends.

In conclusion, I think that students should engage in community service. Students should be involved with community service because it would give them something constructive to do after school and it would also be a great way to make new friends. Seeing their communities be better off because of what they did could possibly make a difference in the child's life.
