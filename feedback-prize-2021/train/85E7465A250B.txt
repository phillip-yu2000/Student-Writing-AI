The studying of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The studys of Venus has almost the same features of Earth, using old technology that could help, and might danger humans.

One of the reason studying of Venus is a worthy prusuit despite the danger it presents because it might almost- like features of Earth, but its hard to get close to Venus to see if its true. For example," On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrennheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than whatwe experience on our own planet"(3). This explain that its too dangers to see if Venus has almost the same the features of planet Earth.

Another reason worthy prusuit depite the danger is using old technology fromt he pass. From the article," the thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and lever and do not require electronies at all" (7). This quite says that even tho NASA might use old technology from the past that technology don't require electronies from today. It's hard to use old technologly from the past with new things.

The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" that studying Venus is worthy pursuit depite the dangers it presents. Useing old technology and seeing if Venus has almost the same featuresas Earth.
