it would be fun to take the pertunity because you get to see new places and new sights and you get to live like a cowboy. for a wile and that would be fun to do if you normaly arent. countryand you get to do new thing such as riding horses and stacking hay.

And it would also be intersting, becaseu you get to new thinks like syack hay ride a horese agian and you get to live driffrent like get up early and you got to feed the, animals and you got to drees diffrent like put on boots so that you dont get muddy.

And there is something eles in valved the war when the war was over they had to give out food becaseu every thing was disrioed so they had to give out food and give out stuff that was needed.

And that is why it would be fun interesting and dangrous so next time never move somewere there is going to be a war
