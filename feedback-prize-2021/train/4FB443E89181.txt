Uh, no. If this is true, then our principal is a moron. This is such a dumb idea! Sure most students have a C average grade. But that's still a passing grade! Some kids aren't as smart as others, but are better at sports than them by a mile! Sometimes, when someone is feeling stressed out, they'll go shoot hoops or kick a soccer ball around. Sometimes it's the only thing they can do to relieve stress! and if they can't do right after school with their friends, just because of one bad grade, that's lame. Maybe they have a C average because they got one bad grade on a test because they spaced out on it. Big deal! They can make it up in the next week or so. And besides, more scholarships are handed out for sports than for academics.

If they're in the chess club, same thing. Let's say a team goes to nationals one year because of one kid. And the next year, that kid gets a bad grade. There can be no exceptions to the rule so if you want him back on the team, you're screwed. Because of one stupid little rule, you lose all chances of getting a nice trophy in your trophy case and your four year in a row winning streak. If you ask me, anyone with a passing grade should be allowed to do any school activity they want to.
