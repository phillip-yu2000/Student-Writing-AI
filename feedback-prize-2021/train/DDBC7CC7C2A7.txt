Phones and driving

Society today is run by phones. It is a part of our everyday lives and many people can not live without them. Phones are incorporated in our jobs our sleep and are very important while driving. It is a commodity that is simply needed while driving. Drivers should be able to use cellphones while driving for navigation, work purposes, and overall, just entertainment.

Nowadays nobody understands how to use a map or atlas. One of the main ways people get around is phone GPS. People do not have time to try to read a map because life today is so fast. Also it is not dangerous because phone companies have made it safer to use the GPS on phones hands free. For many people cellphones are the most essential part of travel.

In life today we live in the fast lane. Due to that jobs usually require you to be available at almost any time. One of these times can be while driving. People simply don't have the time to wait and need to have conference calls or listen to work instructions over the phone. Many jobs also require people to be on the road a lot which means people have no choice but to use their phones.

Lastly radio is dead. Many people use their phones for entertainment in the car especially for long trips. People also use their phones if they just want to talk to a friend or family. The phone and app companies have taken those factors into account and have made it safer for people to use phones while driving. People shouldn't have to be bored out of their mind while driving.

Phones are a new part of society that is taking over everywhere by storm. People have come to depend on the items more and more. People have also started driving more and more. There is much reason why we should figure out ways to incorporate into daily life rather than not. Times have changed and its best to adapt to it rather than run from it.
