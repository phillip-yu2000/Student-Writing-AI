You may think living without a car would be impossible. But just take a moment and think about if your life would be easier? Most of you are thinking most likely no. But I will show many examples on how living without a car would only make your life easier.

In all honesty. There wouldn't be any more car acidents. Which means there would be less deaths and injuries. Another advantage would be having more money because you wouldnt have to buy a car and pay for car insurance. You may be reading and now are starting to think that this isn't bad at all. It may be a hasle to get around but you'd be saving so much money.

In our eoconomy saving money is everything. So if people don't use cars. And they save up all their money. Then they'll be set and more happ with life. Mostly because they're not fed up with multiple car payments every month. And one more additional thing is that it will make the enviorment more safe and not as air polluted as once was.
