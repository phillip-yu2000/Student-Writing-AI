I had a very amazing time being a Seagoing Cowboy, and this is why I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy also. This is one of the best opportunitys you could possibly have. If you love being around aniamls or helping people this would be something perfect for you. Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is you get to see so many cool places. During my time of being a Seagoing Cowboy I saw Europe, China, Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and a excavated castle in Crete.

One of my favorite parts of being a Seagoing Cowboy was after we unloaded the animals. This is because we had the whole ship to ourselves, sometimes we even played games or sports in the area we kept the animals. The things we did were baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other ganes. If you love to do things like this then you would enjoy being a Seagoing Cowboy.

In conclusion you should really think about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. All of the reasons that were listed above are great things, and if you enjoy those things then you will enjoy being a Seagoing Cowboy. Also this is a really great way to help out for the people in need. So I truley recomend you becoming a Seagoing Cowboy!
