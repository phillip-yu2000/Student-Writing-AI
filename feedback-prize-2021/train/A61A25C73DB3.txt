You should join Seagoing Cowboys program because you can see lots of things you have never seen before in your life.

And you can spend time were ever you go but not forever.

You can stay there for maybe a day or two.

But that is mostly for rest, it dosen't mean you can't play around with kids or meat new people.

And you get to go sailing alot when you are traviling to were you are going or if you are going back to were you live.

When you are going to were ou have to go you do have to bring straw,hay, and soy beans.

For the animals to eat because you do have to take care of the animals.

But you would probably like taking care of the different animals you haven't seen in your life before.

And if you are luke you would take advantage of it because you can meat new people and play new games in your life.

Plus when you go home you can tell stories about what you did and when someone ask you if you went to china or somthing you can say yes probably.

Then you would probably have to go back so when you do you won't have to sneak around because you will no people.

That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
