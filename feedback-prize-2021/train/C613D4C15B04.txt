Dear Senator of Florida,

I strongly believe that we have to change the way we vote because the Electoral College is a horrible way to vote. It is not fair one bit and i think we should vote for the candidates that deserve to truely win. Not have it where we vote for someone but we actually are just voting for a slate of 34 electors who are pledged to the runner.

Electoral college has so many disagreements, but then it has agreements. This way of voting avoids run-off elections because if two candidates had the same amount of popular votes then they look at the electoral votes and it helps them know who is the winner. In large states they try to do electoral votes becuase it gives the presidential candidates more attention in a campaign than smaller states do.

Then we have the disagreements and they are pretty good logical points. When we use this system we dont vote for the president we are only voting for a slate of electors that elect for the president themselves. This just basically in my eyes looks like a cheat election and it shouldnt even count. Another thing is this method of selecting our president turns off potential voters for a candidate that has no intension of carrying for their state. Some people just vote to vote so they dont care of what might happen to their surroundings but then there are people that are voters and care and want to express a political preference other than the people that think a single vote will decide an election.

"Electoral Votes get overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner". The electors are the ones that are voting not the people. This is all wrong i believe that we should vote for the president by popular vote. Its more fair and efficent. There wouldnt be anymore cheat elections. It would be the "people voting finally"!
