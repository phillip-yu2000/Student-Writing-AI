Dear, Principle

I don't think that it is fair that you are doing this. A lot of people like sports and other activities that the school host. So they should be able to play and attend the activities. If you do this most people will not be able to play and you have enough players to play on the team. This will make me and a lot of other students very angry and I'm sure that you don't want that. Sports are my life to me and also to my friends and if you take them away we will have nothing to do. You shouldn't make a change to the rule whatsoever. I think it is fair that the rule is requiring at least a C average. It has been like that for all of the other students that went to this school before me. So it is only fair that you keep it the same for us too. You also might lose some students if you change the rule. You're going to get a lot of complaints from parents and students. So that will just be another thing to worry about. I'm sure that you already have enough on your hands

A lot of the students have a C average and a C is an average grade after all. Students will also be happier and will have a positive attitude at school. Besides you're supposed to have fun outside of school and a lot of people wont be able to have fun with this new rule. Also, you are supposed to get at least thirty minutes of exercise a day and some students won't get their exercise in if they cant play sports or attend activities because of their grade. I'm sure you don't want that. So please all that I am asking for is to not change the rule to a B average. If you don't change the rule it will be much appreciated by students and parents as well.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
