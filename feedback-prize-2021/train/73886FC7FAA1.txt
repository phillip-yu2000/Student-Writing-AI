Dear Principle,

I think that students should be allowed to have their cell phones in school. But they could only use them during free time, lunch, or out of the classroom. Because the students work pretty hard and deserve some time to themselves on the phone. Once they are in the class the cell phones have to be turned off or put on vibrate. Because if they are on during class it will cause a big distraction to everyone else who is trying to learn. But it is also important to have your cell phone with you in case of an emergency. For example, if the school goes on lockdown the students have to inform their parents of what's going on. Or if an after-school activity gets cancelled the student have to let their parents know ahead of time so they can try to get a ride. So if you can please take the time to consider the options it will mean a lot. Thanks for your time and have a nice day.
