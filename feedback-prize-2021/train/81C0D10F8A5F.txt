Lowering our car usage will be beneficial for all of us, the advantages of doing this will be huge, and will help the enviroment. Lately a lot of studies have revealed that one of the most eviroment-harming actions are the emissions that cars release into the atmosphere. If we lower our car usage we will help the enviroment of the planet we are living in, it only seems logical to do so.

One of the reasons lowering car usage would be helpful is beacause it would significantly lower gas emissions from cars. This would greatly help our enviroment. According to the text, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.". This shows how harmful this emissions are, and why we should try to lower them.

Lowering our car usage and creating car-free suburbs or car-reduced communities would help our daily life. Driving a car every day can be stressful because of trafic and road rage.

lowering our car usage would help people relieve stress and even get some excercise. According to the text, "When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way". This shows how stress-relieving reducing car usage could be.

Also lowering car usage could be a way for the goverment to create more bicycle paths. This would be really helpful to the people who only have a bicycle as a way of transportation. According to the text,"The day without cars is part of an improvement campaing tha began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"

There are some people that do not agree with this idea, most of them say that it would hurt the car industry. Of course it will, but this is for a greater good. So let's reduce our car usage and help our enviroment.       Â
