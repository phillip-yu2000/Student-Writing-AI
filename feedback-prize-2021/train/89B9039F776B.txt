It is a tough disition ,but i would have to side with No. The first main problem is that almost all states say it's illigal to use them, so good luck traveling. Another issue is that the cars don't travel that fast, so long distance drives could double or even triple the time it would take to get there, vs you driving. If the car somehow crash who would be to blame? That can be another issue, if it came to legal resons who would be to blame? Another key reason is Drivers will be less aleart due to them well . . . not driving, creating an issue if the car needed a driver and they wern't prepard because they were sleeping, on the phone, or ect. Even if the drivers were paying attention the driver would still have to drive making it not a self driving car.

Self driving cars still have a long way to go ,but it is intresting to see how they are now and how they can improve. Mabey I'd switch my mind even in the near future ,but for now, i'll stay with my own driving skills.
