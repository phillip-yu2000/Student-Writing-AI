25 years ago, there was an abnormal structure discovered by NASA's Viking 1 Space Shuttle as it was circling Mars to find possible landing sites for it's siter ship Viking 2 when it spotted the abnormal structure. This abnormal sturcture was called the "Face on Mars" that stretched out two miles from end to end located in Cydonia. Shortly after it was found, scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

In 1976, the first pictures of the "Face on Mars" was taken by NASA's Viking 1, but a few days later NASA unveiled the image for the world to see and told people it was just a "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." As of May 24, 2001, NASA revealed "the Face on Mars" is just a mesa. As the pictures were reveiled on the JPL web site "the Face on Mars" was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all. On April 8, 2001, Mallin's team captured a photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltuion, each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking 1 photo in 1976. "If there was an object in this photograph like planes on the ground of Eygptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!", said Garvin.

In conclusion, "the Face on Mars" is not real for it it just a natural landform on the Red Planet. "In the picture it actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common arounf the American West." says Garvin. Many people believed that this photo was created by aliens but we have pictures and space shuttles out there to prove "the Face on Mars" is just a landform on the Red Planet.
