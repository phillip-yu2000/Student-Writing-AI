Dear principal,

As you may know many of our students are either against the decision of changing the grade average to participate in a sport from C average to B. Or they agree with you. In my opinion i think its unfair, because we already work hard to maintain a 2.0 to be in a sport we love. and now with you changing the grade average. Honestly its going to be hard for some of us students, because some of us struggle already to maintain a 2.0. In my case and for the sake of my fellow peers please we ask of you to not change the grade point average many of us are outraged for your decision. If you can see and put your self in our shoes you will see and learn how hard it is for us students to go from a 2.0 to a 3.0. Consider this many of our students have a C average, and 'it takes a C average for us to join a sport right. Now with you changing the average there's going to be less students to join a sport that they love such as football,soccer,basketball etc. With the changing of the grade average sooner or later no bodies going to not join there favorite sport because its going to be very difficult to get in. So i ask of you for you in behalf of the students don't change the grade average, leave as is.

Sincerely an outraged student)&
