If you are thinking about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, I would highly recomend it. I am Luke Bomberger and I was a former sea cowboy. Being a sea cowboy is a great experence for any type of young man. You use all types of skills like taking care of animals, sailing techneces, and even your athletic side gets used.

You get to explore the world and its uneqe sites like Europe, China, Greece, Venice, and more! I had many advencures away from the ship as well as on the ship. Once I toured an excavated castle in Crete. I also saw the Panama Canal on the way to China and took a gondola ride in the watery city of Venice!

You get keeped working hard cleaning and taking care of the animals but you also get a whole lot of fun! Two weeks may seem like a long time at sea but there are many things that make time fly by! When the animals are getting unloaded you can play games like baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals are being housed. There is also many other games like fencing, reading, boxing, and table-tennis to make the time go faster. The opportunity has made me aware of the suffering and hardships in other countrys. Why can't it do the same for you?

This opportunity is not all fun though. Once on one of my16 trips there where 335 horses and the hay and oats to feed them. All of the animals need to be watered 2 or 3 times a day so you can not get lazy! Stall have to be cleaned too!

If you get a great opportunity like this, do not back down! It may be an advencure just waiting to happen!

Show the people in need that you do care for them!
