Have you ever wanted to become a hero? Have you wanted to help people through tough times? Well I know the job just for you! A Seagoing Cowboy. My name is Luke and I was a seagoing cowboy. One day my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I knew I couldn't resist the opportunity. It was 1945 and World War II was all over Europe leaving cities in ruins. Luckily, many nations came together to help support Europe. The UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were being shipped overseas. My friend and I both signed up.

We joined the group because we knew it would be an experience of a lifetime. We also wanted to help people and animals in need. It felt so good to be able to be called a hero. You also get to see many countries and their landmarks. They give you freetime to go and explore the city or town. You learn so much from the cultures and the different people who live there. Although it takes a lot of time, it is definitly worth the trip. You are so proud of yourself for helping people and animals. There is a lot of work involved and you have to be willing to do it. In the end though, it pays off.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy opened up a whole new world for me. It was definitly an adventure that I will never forget. It made me more aware of people and their needs. My family hosted a number of people from all over the world. It brought a new light into our eyes. We now know that not all people have what we have. We learned that we need to stay humble no matter how much we have. So go ahead, see what new adventure is waiting for you as a Seagoing Cowboy.
