I believe that using the FACS(Facial Action Coding System) is important to have/use in classroom to read students facial expression and to know what they are feeling, because some teacher's may be going through the classwork or the lesson for the day too fast and a student may not understand what is going on and they are too scared or nervous to ask the teacher to slow down and/or repeat what they said so having the facial coding system will help teacher's with that so they either know who to help or realize that they are going too fast and need to slow down or explain it better for other students to catch on. In the reading in paragraph six, it says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in class" the facial coding would be good at helping teacher know what they need to do more in the class, like if a student is bored then the teacher would know that they need to do more fun activities in class that have something to do with the lesson for that day can help with people who are both confused and/or bored, it will help the students that are bored have something to do so they will not be bored and it would help the students that are confused get the hang of what is going on in the class and help them understand. In paragraph six it also says "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor", meaning that facial coding would help teachers be able to know for sure if a student is confused or bored in a classroom. The facial coding system would not only help teachers figure out if a student is understanding classwork but it would also help to find out if a student is having personal issues and won't say anything or they are too scared to say what's going on, it would be more than helpful to know what that student is feeling and asking them about it and asking if they wanted to talk about and/or letting them know that they can talk to you if needed instead of knowing what that person is feeling and letting them keep their emotions bottled up and them not talking to anyone about how they feel and that student ends up doing something that could do harm to them or others. With that being said I believe that having the facial coding system would not only be helpful in classrooms but in schools too.
