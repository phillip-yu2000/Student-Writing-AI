Driverless cars are something that Google has been working on for years, some of the biggest car manufacturers in todays market are planning on having autonomous cars in production by the year 2020. There is still a lot of planning and designing to do before we will be able to drive these cars, but they will be in our future! Making driverless cars is a great idea and i am for it. Most states have driving laws that make it illegal to drive or even test these electronically driven cars, manufacturers are getting hopeful that when these cars are ready, safe, and fully advanced the laws will be changing.

First, todays trffic laws are "... written with the assumption that the only safe cars has a human driver in control at all times.", which means that the manufacturers must make a car thta keeps the driver, passenger, and any pedestrians safe. Manufacturers believe that once these cars prove more reliably safe that more states will grow onto the idea of driverless cars. Having driverless cars is a good idea because they also will only use around half of the fuel used in todays average taxi. So far Google has had these cars drive half a million miles without a single crash!

In conclusion autonomous cars should be a part our future. These cars have been test driven around 500,000 miles without a single crash. Driverless cars use sensors to keep a full 3D picture detecting all the things surrounding the car. Even though there is still some planning that needs done I believe the world should give these new cars a chance when the time is right.
