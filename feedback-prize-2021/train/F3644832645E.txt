Have you ever wonder what over planet is like earth?

Studying venus is a wortthy pursit despit its dangers,

venus has simlair features to earht in fact the text it referred to as Earth "Twin" becaus e of its size and density and sometimes the distance from the sun. venus long ago,"probably" had oceans and spme type of forms of life living on venus, at this moment in time if you look at a picture are captured of venus you would see rocky sediment and features such as valleys,mountains and craters.

Now that we've understand the good aspects of venus their are some very dangerous cons about veunes. at thirty plus miles above surface the temperature rises at 170 degrees farenheit it sounds nice and toasty but air pressure would close to sea level on earth,solar power would be plentifull and radiation would not exceed on earth so its not survuable for humans. many spaceships landed on venus but many didnt make it back due to conditions of the tempature in closing as much as we want to disciver new things and find somewhere other then earth we must look at the terms and conditions
