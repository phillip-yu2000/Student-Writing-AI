Dear principal,

You are honestly considering making every student participate in community service? I do not think you should require us to. Let me explain then you decide.

For my first reason it will be too much of a hassle for you and the rest of the staff. Parents will call and complain about their child not wanting to do it. How would students get to the sites after cleaning up close to school? You will have to pay bus drivers to take the students to the site. Depending on how big the school is you may need a couple busses with all the money going to this we could had got new text books or something to benefit our learning.

Less students will enroll in our school or some may drop out. We are at school to learn, not to pick up trash other people threw out. If students do not want to do not make them, it defeats the purpose. They already have a system that does that it is called a chain gang. They broke the law we did nothing wrong so why should we have to do it? How are you going to make sure students do not ditch you can only punish them later.

I believe it will be a great mistake and cost our school money we could be using to make our school a safer learning environment. So if you do not want to cost us everything then do not make us do it. Thank you for taking time to read this, and please respond soon.

Sincerely your student,
