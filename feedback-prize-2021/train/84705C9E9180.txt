To begin with, I personally think students wouldn't benefit taking school online and these are my reasons why.

I think that some students wouldn't benefit from taking classes at home, Just because they wouldn't understand what they are learning and It would be harder for them to actually understand the concept and do the work.

The students wouldn't have help from a teacher when they don't understand something or when they need help. some students would'nt be able to concentrate on doing the work because they may be distracted by something going on around the house. May have things to do around the house and wouldn't be able to do his work and turn in work on time. The student would find a way to get the answers rather then learning the concept.

The students won't learn a lot about things that some classes teach you such as, learning how to manage money and in school they can teach you those things step by step. They wouldn't be use to waking up every morning and if they have a job they would wake up or be late because they weren't use to waking up early every day just like the students that go to school.Â
