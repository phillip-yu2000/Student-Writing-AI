Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that Policy 1; Allowing students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is the best policy to use. I believe this policy is the best because would you rather allow us to have them and use them when we can and allowed too or sneak behind your back and use them all day long to text or call people? I think that by not allowing us to bring them will cause us to rebel more and use them during class time, lunch time and virtually all day long, when if you let us use them we will obey the rule and respect you by actually letting us use them so then we will listen and we will know you understand we are actually obsessed with them. The reason i think this is because if a kid is very sick and no one believes him, he can call his parent/ guardian during a time he will be able to use his phone and his the person he calls will come get him during school hours so the next day he is not sick because he did not get proper care from the school when he needed it and he will come to school the next day. Another reason i think they should be used during free time only is because if all you do is talk to your friends during free time you have nothing else to do, you can play around with your cell phone so we are not disturbing you and annoying the class and most of all the teachers. One more reason i think Policy 1 is a good policy is because by you actually letting us use our phones and trusting us to know that we will only use our phone during the time you want us too, it will make us have more respect for you and let us know that you trust us enough to obey the rules and not use them at any other time then free time. I also believe that if you do not let us use phones during school we will be more tempted to use them and pull them out during class to text or call people. These are just some of the many reasons I think Policy 1 is the best policy for you to chose when picking one or the other. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME, 8th grade
