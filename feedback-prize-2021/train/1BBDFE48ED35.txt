The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Should we keep the electoral college or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

In my opinion I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think we should change because under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elects the president. for example, if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for John Kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. If those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and get 34 electoral votes. The electors can be anyone not holding office. Voters cannot control whom thier electors vote for.

The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the races in the swing states. The elctoral college is widely regared as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. Abolish the elactoral college. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.
