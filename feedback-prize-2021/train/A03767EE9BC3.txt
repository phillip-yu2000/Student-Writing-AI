Dear Principal,

Helping others who are in need are important. Would you like help if you were in need of it?

Doing at least a weeks worth of community service is not going to hurt anyone. Community service can help build character and give a child some experience. Community service like picking up litter is go for the environment.

If we plan on living on earth, for many decades to come we need to take care of the earth. Conserve water, pick up trash and just see how much less trash there is and how healthy the earth looks. Tutoring some one is very helpful to. If a child needs help or is struggling with some academic subjects someone guiding them and helping them along the way to greater success in life and passing high school and college will be a much better future other wise with out all things you learn earlier in a child's life.

Requiring students to do a week's worth of community service is okay, but if you are deciding to make this mandatory you should make it so they have to have it all done by the end of that year that you assign it and it should be required that only for one year. This will give the students time to get this done and it will not interfere with their busy everyday lives or other school work.
