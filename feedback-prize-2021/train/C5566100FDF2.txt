Dear Principal,

I think students should be allowed to bring their cell phone and only use it during free times. It is better than not bringing it at all because even when they're not suppose to bring it they still do and get caught. Teens now just like texting and using their cell phone. Cell phone are needed because of an emergency , forgot something, or of other reasons. During free times, students get bored and want to use their cell phone for entertainment. Not bringing their cell phone get people in some trouble because they still bring it. Bringing their phones won't get many students in trouble because they're allow to have it and the population of breaking the rule will be less and less. I think students should have their cell phones and only be used during lunch or free times. Cell phones are used all the time anywhere you are and people are used to using their phone all the time so it should be used at school also.
