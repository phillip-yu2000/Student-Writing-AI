Opinions are great when it comes to seeking advise. The top things why people ask people for advise is because they want to dial the main one almost everyone said so that it is best option, people may have good different opinions, and the people might have gone threw it.

Dialing down the one opinion isn't always the worst thing, it could just mean you like that one opinion, or it could mean that it was the one that almost everyone said. Sometimes opinions aren't always bad thing, but you have to have a reason for the opinion or advise that you are giving to someone. Although some of the advise people gave you wasn't what you were looking for but it could help you if that is your last option.

Second reason why you ask people for advise is because they all have different opinions about the situation that you are in. Different ideas help because you might have not thought of that idea or thought of the idea but never saw it in that way. Yes maybe some if not most ideas will be bad, but it is still good to try so you do get there perspective on the situation.

Third reason why you ask for advise is because the people that you're asking might have been threw that situation before in there lifetime. I'll give you an example, when you ask for advise you usually go with someone that is older than you like a family member or an adult if you are a kid. Usually elders give good advise too because they have seen or done the thing that you are asking them.

Finally, as you can see there are many different ways why you ask for advise like dialing it down to the better one, different opinions from other people, and they might have gone threw the exact same situation or seen it happen. This is why opinions are great to people who need advise from other people in this world.Â
