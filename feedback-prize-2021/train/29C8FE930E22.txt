I believe that through the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," that the author has built an exellent argument for why we should explore Venus. I say this because throughout the article the author points out many of the challenges that would come up durring exploration, as well as potential solutions to them.

In paragraph three the author tells us that no previous spacecraft has been able to survive for more than a few hours. The author counters this problem in paragraph seven when they show us how simplified electronics made from silicon carbide last for weeks in simulations of Venus's conditions.

Another time the author shows us some of the most challenging problems with exploring Venus is in paragraph four when she talks about he clouds of sulfiric acid, the 800 defree Fahrenheit temperatures, volcanoes, earthquakes, lightning strikes to probes surface and atmospheric pressure much greater than here on Earth. They go on to explain, in paragraph five, a solution to this problem would be to make vehicles that would fly thirty miles above the landscape where the conditions are nowhere near as hostile with temperature of 170 degrees, and air pressure similar to Earth. This solution not only solves the problems of being on the surface but also comes with the advantage of having solar power.

In paragraph six the author states that from the thirty mile height above the the vehicle could not easily photograph the surface or take samples of the planet. She debates this in the same paragraph when they tell us that scientist are currently working on machinery that could contribute meaningful knowlege about Venus.

In conclusion trying to explore Venus cold be potentially dangerous, but possible. All of the problems the author has shown us have potential solutions, and the exploration could contribute to the knowlege of Venus. I Believe that because of this, the author has made an excellent argument as to why we should explore Venus.
