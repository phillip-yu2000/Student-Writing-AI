Dear Principal,

I believe that having a B average for playing sports is a ridiculous idea because a C average is normal range above a C average is above normal. When it comes to playing sports having a C average should be good enough to play on a team. Some students have a hard time keeping a C average but they do it because they want to be able to play sports. Sports are something students can do at school that is fun but if you higher the average many students might not be able to play causing not enough players on team which will shut down many sport teams. This will not benefit the school.

Some kids only get that C average to be on a team and if you raise the average they might not even try to be on a team so now they have no reason to try to get good grades at all. That will lower students averages down and make the school look bad. Having the average higher might make the students under more pressure and stress. With a higher average they try harder on their schoolwork, then they go practice, and then they do their homework which as to be twice as good as it was before. When do these kids get some free time? Being on a sport team is hard enough but if they have to work even harder keeping their grades up it might be too much stress on themselves.

It might make the grade averages higher but I believe that it will be too hard on the students so we should keep it a C average. These are my thoughts and opinions use them when you consider your ideas.

Sincerely,

A student
