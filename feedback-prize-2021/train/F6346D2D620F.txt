Do you think drivless cars are safe? Someday everyone in this world might have a car that can drive itself. For this reason I think driveless cars should be given a try and be used by others in the world. Having drivelss cars may also be better for the environment.

Having driveless cars is a very cool and interesting thing, but it can also be very dangerous. I am all for having driveless cars but there are some dangers and questions that come with that. Such as "How do we know that the technology is up to par?"and "Will it know when to exactly tell me when i need to take over?". It can also be dangerous because the may be driving in the right direction, but you have people that get out of control or do dumb things when driving. Sometimes it might not be you or the cars fault.

The article says that the driveless cars "would use have of the fuel od today's taxis." Having the cars use less fuel will help the environment function better and it would cut down on some pollution. Pollution now days is very bad due to more factories being built and more crisis evolving in the world.

So I think driveless cars are a good thing. There just needs to be moremodifications and research done on having them. Driveless cars could be a way to cut down on pollution. I think manufacturers should give it a try and see what the turn out is.
