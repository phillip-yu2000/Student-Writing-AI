Dear Principal,

I think that students should not be allowed to use their phones at school at all. If students text or talk over their phones on their free time, when they go to class they might still want to text. Probably they will off course the teachers wont be able to notice because they will be busy teaching the rest of the class.

If students are talking to other kids from other schools, the other kids might get in trouble because they are probably not allowed to use their phones in their free time to. The other school might find out and our school could end up having problems.

Students might not finish texting in their free time and they will want to finish in class. When students are in class and they look like they are paying attention, instead they could be thinking about what they were texting or talking in their phones.

If we do not want our school to have problems with other schools because we text or talk to the kids from other schools then YOU the Principal should not allowed for students to use their cell phones on their free time.
