Hello, my name is Luke and I am a former "Seagoing Cowboy."

What is a "Seagoing Cowboy", you ask?

It is a member of United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA.)

Our job is to keep an eye on the cows and horses that go overseas.

If you ever get a chance to become a Seagoing Cowboy, trust me, you will NOT want to miss it.

One of the reasons I enjoyed being a member of UNRRA so much is that it gave me a chance to build friendships and communities with other countries.

I think that is a very important thing to have because without that bond, you might beome enemies and go to war.

Another thing that I enjoyed was just life as a Seagoing Cowbiy in general!

For starters, I LOVE farm animals so I had no problem with watching a bunch of cows and horses all day.

Not to mention that the scenery is absoloutly gorgous!

I got to see plenty of astounding sights such as the Panama Canal and the Acropolis in Greece.

In conclusion, being a member of UNRRA is and oppertunity you don't want to miss.

You get to spend time with animals, see epic scenery, and most importantly, build a bond with other communites.

I had so much fun as a Seagoing Cowboy, and I know ypu will too.
