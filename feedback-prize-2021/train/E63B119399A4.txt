Dear Principal,

I think the better policy of those two offered is the first policy. For one reason, students already text during class, so if you give them the opportunity to do it in between class periods and during free times, there will be no need for them to text during class.

Another reason to let us have cell phones during free times is that if we need to fix our plans, we could call our parents and tell them what we are going to do. An example of this would be that if your after school activities were cancelled, you could call your parents and arrange for a ride.

A third reason that I like this policy is that if I wanted to go to a friends house, I could just get out my phone in between classes and call my parents and ask them if it was alright if I went. I wouldn't have to go to the office in between classes and I would already have the number programmed into my phone.

If you are afraid of students texting during class even with this policy, then you should design and give them a contract to sign. What I mean by this is that you should make and print out one contract per student. It wouldn't have to be a very fancy or official contract, just make it state that if they do text in class, they lose their privileges. It should also say that if they get caught doing it again, then they would start earning themselves detention.

If you choose the first policy, many students would be happy with your choice. I also suggest that you use some of my ideas to help.

Sincerely,
