When growing up, you most likely imagined the future having flying cars. For example, Meet the Robinsons, a movie in which the whole plot of the story is based on time traveling cars! But, to me, having a car that can drive itself is way better. I'll prove it to you.

My first example is, you wouldn't have to necessarily get your license! The car drives it for you! I mean, yeah, you might want to know a little about how to drive them if something goes wrong, but none of us would have to go through the 6-9 months of "Drivers ED" that costs a million dollars. You should be able to take a class in high school or grab a book that tells you all about the vehicle, giving you all the information and knowledge you need. Wouldn't that be awesome?

Next, less accidents would occur. No, maybe not all because of some freak accident may happen sometime along the way, but less is better than what the rates are now. I mean, most deaths you hear about have something to do with car accidents. Just think about it, all those poeple that have lost a loved one in a car accident most likely would be on board with this. I'm sure they would never want someone else to go through what they went through. Also, old people wouldn't have to get their license revoked becuase they're too old! Everyone can drive!

In all honesty, it would just be easier. No worrying about drunk driving, no having to take someone to the doctor with you because you can't drive yourself home with all that medicine in you that makes you wacky, and no more backseat drivers! Oh my goodness they are so annoying! Now, when you think the driving is bad you can yell at the car, (which it shouldn't be but you get what im saying).

In conclusion, I hope I have at least altered your opinion in some way, shape, or form to agree with me. I also hope sometime in the future we can all enjoy a driverless car, along with safe roads and better lives.
