Imagine if you wanted advice on how to make a cake, and you asked one person that may or may not know how to make a cake, you decided to make anyway, and it looks terrible, but if you asked multiple people how to make a cake, than you would know what to do right and what not to do. Personally I think that asking more people about advice on anything can make it a lot better than what it originally was.

Asking multiple people about anything can make it so much better, say you wanted advice on what type of shoes to buy, and you didn't have the greatest taste in shoes, so you decide to ask people around you what type of shoe looked better and why they are better, and you buy the shoes multiple people said were better and they where actually good.

Asking multiple people advice is like a vote to what is better, like voting for president which president is better than the other, would you want a terrible president or never to be able to eat the food you enjoy eating.

Asking advice can sometimes go wrong, like if you asked someone for advice on how to get a girlfriend and they told you to say things that are offensive to women or make them feel uncomfortable and could possibly put you in jail, thats why its best to ask multiple people before you do what they said.

Personally I think that asking more people about advice on anything can make it a lot better than what it originally was. Would you want advice from multiple people or from just one.
