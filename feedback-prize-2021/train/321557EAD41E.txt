Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an amazing thing to do. You get to do all kinds of stuff on the sea. You get to do stuff you don't even think of doing. Here are some reasons why I think you should join us and become a Seagoing Cowboy.

One of my reasons why I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is because you get to have so much fun on the boat or other places you stop. You get to help animals, find new people, and when you drop the animals off at the location, you can even play games in the stalls where they were held. Another fun thing you get to do while being a Seagoing Cowboy is going over-seas. Going over-seas is an awesome experience. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice.

The second reason I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is, because of the sightseeing. When you see those amazing sculptures or ruins of what you know what they were, you can take pictures in your head and tell people stories of what yoiu saw. A couple of the sights that I got to see were, the Acropolis in Greece, I got to see China, and I also got to see Europe. Seeing these things changed my life completely.

My last but certainly not least reason is that you get to be with animals the whole ride. Sure they "cost" some responsibility but they can be fun to play with. Animals are amazing creatures and getting to spend along time with them will make you never wanna let go. When you're on the ship, and you're heading to your destination, you can sometimes get lonesome. But don't forget you have animals to keep you not bored and get your responsibility up.

Seagoing Cowboys are amazing jobs that you can do. Even if you don't like adventures this is still an amazing job. People need more adventures so if you're olne of those peopled, join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
