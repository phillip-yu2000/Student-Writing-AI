Dear Mr. Principal,

I have recently over heard that you are changing the school policy so that only students with a grade of B or above my participate in sports and other activities. In some ways I agree with this change. Education is more important than other activities. Yet, sports and other activities are also very influencing in a child's life.

This change is reasonable in many ways. Education is always more important than sports and other extra-curricular activities. School is what helps people have a effective life. It's the foundation of a successful life. Although sports are good for the body, education is what makes people's futures brighter.

Although education is very important, I also think sports and other activities are very prominent too. Sports are what make people healthy. They can make personal issues better. For example, if someone is very self-cautious of their weight, lots of running and workouts can improve those things. Sports can also improve a student's behavior. Not only do they provide exercise, they also teach students how to use team work to get things accomplished. They also teach students a very important life lesson: how to cooperate with on another.

In addition, other activities can get kids involved in their communities and the school. Joining recycling club can teach students how to make the Earth a better place to live. Maybe they'll take the initiative and go pick up trash in their own neighborhoods. Plus, statics say that students participating in sports and other activities are less likely to do drugs.

In conclusion, I think changing the policy is a very big mistake. Although most of the students in our school have a grade average of C, I think they should still be able to participate in sports and other activities. Being active in sports can make for a more healthy person. Also, activities can get students more involved in their communities and the school.

Best regards,

A very concerned student
