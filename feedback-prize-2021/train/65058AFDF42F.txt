It would be a cool thing to have for something to read your facial expressions. But i don't think it will work very well because what happens if someone doesn't show much facial expressions. You just can't go by what their facial expression is. What if someone is having a bad day but is showing no facial expression about it.

The facial expression machine would be fun to have until we need something more new that can read facial expressions and nonfacial expressions. The reason we need something more new i becuase the fact that the machine can get it wrong if the person isn't showing a facial expression. Like you can't just tell by that becuase they can go wrong. The person may not show emotions that much so they can hide it really well. Also people don't really like to tell people how they are feeling.

So if they did have a machine that can read facial expressions but can't read emotions that they are hiding isn't a very good machine. They just need to build a machine that can do both. All because someone can be something else then what the machine picks up. So they need something that can do both so it can be right. All because of the reason someone don't show a whole lot of emotions. Plus the person can be lying to the machine and the machine picks up that you are happy but really you are not.
