Dear Senator ,

The stretegy we still use to elect our president is not always effective. During the times that the United States was becoming a country , many senators argued that having states with more electoral votes is extremely unfair. By doing so ,you are telling the people of that state that their vote is not worth as much as someone that lives for example in California. Using electoral college made George W. Bush president when most people preferred Al Gore. With the help of our advanced technology , we could accomplish giving equivalent votes to each person of the United States regardless of their location. If we wouuld have used popular vote since the beginning of history, we could have avoided having presidents such as George W. Bush that have caused catastrophes in this country. The winner-takes-all system portrays no justice. It is no coicidence that the president constantly visits countries with the most electoral votes.+

Sincerely , PROPER_NAME
