I don't claim that having a technology to read the emotional expressions of students because you never know how someones expression can be it can either be happy,sad,mad,disturbed,anxious,frustration,angry,down,worried or etc. i mean with that technology for that to sense and see how there doing can be kinda weird cause we dont want others to see how were feeling or expressing our self for what reason do they have to see how were expressing our emotions so i am against this claim of have technology to read our emotional expression. For instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the way they have a look on their face. Of course, most of us have trouble describing each facial expression on how u feel an why u feel that way or have that look on your face. My conclusion is that in ife were not gonna need technology to sense our emotion just trust someone or look yourself into the mirror and let all youe expressions out but it's better to know how your feeling instead of technology see how your feeling deep down inside you.
