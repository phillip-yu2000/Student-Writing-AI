The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. There are different ways Venus can despite the dangers.

Firstly, Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet. Can provide limits on ground conditiond because of the dense atmosphere. In the passage says " Researches cannnot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance." Venus would get up close and personal despite the risks. Researchers are working on that would help us know more about Venus.

Secondly, NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicorn carbide have been simulating on Venus surface. In the passage said " Chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and gave lasted for three weeks in such condition." (P.7) Now they use modern computers to help them understand things better then the old computers. Now modern things are more resistant to perssure, heat, and other forces.

Thirdly, striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. Not only because of it's gained on the planet but also in human curiosity. This lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. In the passage said " Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts." (P.8) This saying expanded to meet very edges of imagination and innovation.

In conculsion, Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. We learn new things everyday. We also learn from our past and that's what we are doing with Venus. We are learning how it's not dangers unless you think it is. New things happen everyday we will always want more to learn.
