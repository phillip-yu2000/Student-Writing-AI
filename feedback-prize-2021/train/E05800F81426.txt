Dear principal

My response to these ideas are that I agree with policy one. This is because I think that students should have there cell phones with them in case of an emergency. For example if the student walks home every day someone could try to kidnap them. Or when they are at school there could be some kind of problem, another student could be trying to hurt them. Another example is if they are not feeling good at school and they call there parents to tell them they are sick. Or maybe if the school lets the students get out early and the parents don't know so the students call there parents to let them know. There is also the possibility that there is an earth quack or power out and the school can not call the parents so the students use there phones to call there parents to come and pick them up. also the students should have there phones off during school and they should not interfere with there school work. So in conclusion I think that the students should be allowed to have there phones at school.
