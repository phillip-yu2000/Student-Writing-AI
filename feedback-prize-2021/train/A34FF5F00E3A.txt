I disagree with the principal because some kids may like to go home ,or do not want to do anything after school, they could be busy ,or do not have the right actions or just are not as good at any of the sports. Some kids at the school may not think of the sports as something to do or dont like there school team and could think its not for them to play on a school team or they just cant do it at all . Although,

kids might not wanna do sports at all and think itÃâº a bad team or it just not the type of things they prefer to do . Most children like staying home and playing games or doing other fun things or just eat a lot of food and be lazy but possibly , kids are having a busy life and have to do things and do not have time for the sports like help grandparents or siblings or just watch over the house while no ones there. It may be a bit hard for them to get into any sports if students cant control their actions as in helping or showing there doing something or communication or even able to focus and do what there supposed to do in the sports rules . Also, some students might not like sports at all they might disagree with what things the players do like the body movements or the way their stretching or they just dont like the feeling in sports or activities as in some may not like moving around a lot or they may be out of shape or just have bad health so they think their not going to get anything done or think their not fit for sports .Mean while, some kids may think their not good enough as other students or cant move like them or be as focus when their doing things.
