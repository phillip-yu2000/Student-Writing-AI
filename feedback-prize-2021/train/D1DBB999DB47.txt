Dear Principal,

Students should be allowed to bring their phones at school and use them during free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. Some students need to have their phones at school with them. If you allow students to use phones during free times they won't try to sneak to use their phones during class. Phones are sometimes a necessity. They can be used in school responsibly and turned off in classes.

Many students participate in after school activities. Sometimes these practices or club meetings can be cancelled or delayed. Students may be stuck waiting for hours with no one to call if cell phones are not allowed at school. Students need cell phones at school for extracurricular activities.

If you don't allow students to use cell phones they will just use them behind your back. They will hide them and use them during class. If you allow them to use cell phones during free times they will use them then and not during class.

Some of these people need a phone for emergencies and taking them away could have a negative affect on these students. Students can be trusted to turn off their phone during classes. Although teachers should be allowed to take these phones away if they see them or hear them during class. Some of these students will be driving in a couple of years but you can't trust them with a cell phone.

Taking away phones could do horrible things to your school. Cell phones are a necessity in some students life. You need to trust your students with cell phones. Consider allowing students to use their phones during free periods.

Sincerely,
