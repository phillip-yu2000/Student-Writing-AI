Dear State Senator,

I think that the Electoral College should be disposed of and the president should be elected through citizens' votes. I think this because Congress is biased. They don't have the same ideas as the citizens and can sometimes be difficult. It could be hard to compile the votes from the citizens and the votes from Congress because Congress could have a completely different view on the candidates than the citizens because they work for the government. I think it would be easier to just count up the citizens' votes and majority wins. Apparently Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agree with me.

How it works is they add up all the citizens' votes and say who has the most, then add up Congress's votes and tell the winner. What happens sometimes is there is a winner of the citizens' votes, so who the citizens think should be the new president, then they add Congress's votes up and the president is the other person, not who the citizens want the president to be. How is that fair to the citizens? That would be a big problem because then they wouldn't like their president, there would be rebels, etc. It would not be pretty.

For instance, in Texas, if you wanted to vote for one person, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that would be pledged to that person. If the electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and that person would get 34 electoral votes, but who are the electors? The citizens have no idea. They don't know who picks the electors or who the electors are, it depends on the state. The voters can't always control who their electors vote for. It's not their decision.

I don't think that is fair to the citizens.       Â
