Have you ever wonder how it would feel to know how a person felt in a picture, painting or any other thing or even if they hide their emotions? I feel like that would be such a great thing to have a piece of technology. I believe that this technology is valuable because so many people might have courosity to know what a person felt in a pictures, painting, ect. In this essay I will be arguing, why I feel this piece of technology is valuble, and what differnce would it make to society.

Technology is a major part of our lives, but having a piece of technology that can read a persons emotion is a pretty impressive on how we have advanced in technology. The Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the University of Illinois was capable to make a software that can read people's emotions. the author states," at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions". This proves that now theres something that can study a persons emotions.

Technology has made a big differnce between the years and to have a software that can read a persons emotions is such a huge expanced on what we know. Now that we have a software that reads a persons emotion can really make a really big differnce of society. The author states, " the facial expression for each emotion are universal, usinf video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions".

This proves that the new software is going to make such a huge differnce to our society.

To conclude, Technology is such a valuble pesesion we have in our lives. By having a software that can read emotions is a big step on making this world big. Many won't believe the same but most people in this world are involved with technology and this is going to change throughout the decades. Do you believe that this technology is valuble?
