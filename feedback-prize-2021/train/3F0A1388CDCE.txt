Pursuiting a study of Venus is a really great idea, you learn that its like earths twin. Venus has been called Earth's twin the Evening Star, because its one of the brightest points in the night sky. But the problem with Venus is that its nicknames misslead you. In paragraph two, it talks about how in some past missions they have sent space crafts that haven't survived the landing and if they did it was for only a few hours. It has been three decades since we sent anything to Venus. In paragraph three they talk about how Venus's surface temperatures are over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than Earth. With that environment its posible to crush a ship or submarine. Studying Venus can be a great thing but we still don't know alot about the planet sending some one up there is crazy. Eapasually because we haven't sent anything up there in three decades, sending a human would be crazy.
