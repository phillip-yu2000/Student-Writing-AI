The Seagoing Cowboys program was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. In the Seagoing Cowboys program, we sail to Europe (and many other countries) and see magnificant sights on the way. The Seagoing Cowboys in a huge opportunity that you should take!

The concept of the Seagoing Cowboys it to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you join the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Administration) Seagoing Cowboys you will not regret it. You will be having a great time, while helping other people and making new friends on the boat. While I was on my cattle-rides I have visited many places like Venice, Italy, Europe, China, and many other fasinating landscapes. Being on the Seagoing Cowboys also taught me that work can be fun! During free time, you could enjoy a wide variety of activities including table tennis, boxing, fencing, whittling, and many other games.

The years that I participated in the Seagoing Cowboys program were some of the best years of my life. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a once-in-a-lifetime experience that no one should pass up on!
