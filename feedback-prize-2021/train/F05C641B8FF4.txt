imagine if u could do your school work from home and you didn't have to go to school. you can do your work at any time. although schools are the place of learning but we need a new way of learning. students should benefit from being able to do their school work from home because if a student is sick, they can do their work form home, students dont have to get up so early for school, and they can do it when they want to.

if a student is sick in bed, they can do their work at home. for example, a student has the flu and they cant go to school. they can go home and do the school work there and when they get better. they can go back to school and they will be caught up. anther example, a student has cancer and he has to stay at home. he can do his school work in his bed and he can get treated at the same time.

students dont have to get up so early for school. for an example, Generic_Name is a good student and he has good grades in school. but Generic_Name didnt want to go to school because he wanted to sleep in. he woke up at 12 in the afternoon and said, "i need to do my school work before i do anything else". so he did his work at home and did it first. anther example, a student has a job and work 9 hours a day. he didnt get home until 1 in the moring. he want to sleep in and not go to school.
