Luke think you should join the seagoing cowboys program because you can travel all around and see some pretty nice things like Luke it said in the passage that you take nine trips to things like Greece,China,you will past the Atlantic Ocean and also you can make the world a better place and you can be a hero for being nice. Also so if you want to you can help out animals in the passage it said, the animals had to drink two or three times a day also a way you can help you could clean the stalls on the ship and they will give you jobs and other stuff and so you won't think it is boring you can have fun onboard to they got a lot of things like baseball,and volleyball and the house it is table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and the games make time go fast and that's why I think you should join the seagoing Cowboys program.
