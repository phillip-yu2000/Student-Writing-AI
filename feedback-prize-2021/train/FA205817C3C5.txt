To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME:

As of two weeks ago, I understand that you have considered changing the policy of our academic program here at SCHOOL_NAME so that students may not participate in sports or other activities, such as clubs, unless they have at least a B average in all their classes, which is 86 percent or above. I also understand that you would like to hear the opinions of your students about the change.

Of what I have heard, student don't seem to like the change very much but parents agree with the new policy idea. But as for me, I tend to lean towards the idea of the new policy. I agree that students should have to earn the opportunity to be involved with extra curriculum. The case of most students is that they get very involved with the after school activity and they forget that it comes after school. That's why they call it "after school activity". Therefore, their grades begin to drop.

Students may think of this policy unfair but at the same time they are working hard to meet the goal to bring all their grades up to a B average. This policy will give our students the determination to be in sports or any other activities and they will care about their schoolwork a whole lot more than before. If all of our students have excellent marks it will also give our school a great reputation.

In conclusion, I agree with your new ideas and I hope that you follow through with them. I'm sure that if you do, you will be happy with the results.

Sincerely,

A student at SCHOOL_NAME
