The painting by Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa is very famous around the world and people wondered for years. What was Mona Lisa's emotions?

her emotions are 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry. And you would ask how do you find that out well its this new peice of technology called the Facial Action Coding System.

Do you think this technology should be used in clasrooms to read students emotions. Yes I think that it should be used in classrooms because it would help in so many situations. For example if the teacher hands out an assignment and it shows that the students are confused then that means you could go over it with them and find out what they dont understand. Also the tehnology could find out what the students are feeling in class or if they are getting picked on and you could find out their emtion by it. The third example would be that if the students enjoy the subject or class. And if not change up your teacheing style a little bit to make it more enjoyable.

I think that the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms. It would have so many benifits.
