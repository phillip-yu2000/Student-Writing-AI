Have you ever had that feeling when you get home, finish your homework, maybe hangout with some friends and your still bored? Well, an extracurricular activity like a sport or a club would really be great for you! I think that every student should do at least one extracurricular activity because, it would help students make new friends, and students could earn scholarships while learning on the way.

Doing something else around the community would really get yourself out there to make new friends and open up new opportunities. This would help you later in life when you might need to make friends in college, and those friends would help you out before your exams and other times like that. All in all this is just something everybody should do. It doesn't pack your schedule too much because, if your day is already too chaoticÂ then you probably already are doing an extracurricular activity and you don't need to do another.

This doesn't just help make new friends, trying out new clubs and sports would help you find your thing. This "thing" could be what you really like doing or what your good at doing. Its not only for a great time, but you could earn scholarships to the hardest colleges to attend. You could earn one by simply being good at any sport, or even through a club!

Most clubs through the school are free so I would sign up now to find new friends, open new opportunities, and even earn a scholarship to a college. Next time you turn down a club, I want you to think again and sign up.
