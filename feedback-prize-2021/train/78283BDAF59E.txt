The author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becuase the author thinks that they are "Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans".

In the text it states that "since no spacecraft survived the landing for mote then a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity us." and what i think the author means that venus would be a very challenging planet for humans to study despite that its proximity to us.

The second thing that the author states is that "such an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of oceans and would liquefy many metals." meaning that the temprature in venus is so hot that it would liquefy so many metals. The author says that " tempratures would stillbe toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. not east conditions, but survivable for humans."

The last thing that the text says is that " Our travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginations and innovations." meaning that when humans go to venus and they should expand the very edges of there imaginations and innovations, that they will discover wonders about Venus.
