Dear principle,

I think that community service is very important for us and the environment not only because we are doing good things for our earth but because it helps us too. We come together with people to do something special for our planet. but, I strongly suggest that community service should become an optional decision for students because students should have lots of spare time and use it wisely like to do homework or play sports after school and or have some free time. We need time on our hands to do activities that we need to accomplish. Even though Community service is very important, most kids don't like helping out in that specific type of way.

I myself would consider being a part of community service because i understand how important it is to our everyday lives.

We need community service so people can come together to help out. For example, we need someone to pick up litter or help out someone who is sick and needs to be treated or taken care of. Even though i think it should be an optional opinion on wether or not to be a part of community service i would like to become a part of helping out and everyone getting together and along so we can make our world a better, safer, cleaner, and happier place where we wont have to worry about these important decisions.
