Dear senator i think that the electoral collages  should stay because .With out the the electoral college we could not have a party that is the tie breaker. So then we could not have a president .and they all so vote for the ''president and vice president all 538 electors but to win the vote a party must have 270 of the votes to win ''.and to have equal there are 2 senators and one member of the House of Representatives.

But a electors are chosen by the candidate's political partys  by law .In a certan way  and then be given a responsibilaties . And on every first monday in november the people vote for the prisedent that you want to win. but you are voting for the candidates electors  but each state has a plathora of electorals like texas has 38 electors and californa has 55 and florida has 29 so does new york they are given more because the more populatina a state has the mor electorals you can have . and one other good reason that electoral college is more sofishint way then popular vote because " the winning candidate shares the popular vote and people starte to bicker about how to share it .

The large states  restored a good porshine of the weight in the political balances because the larger states have a bigger population so for example Obama got 29 elactoral votes  and the person who won would get 3 extera elactoral votes . but it is easeyer for the larger states to get attention from presidentail candidates in the campianes than the smaller ones because of how many larger ones have more electores vote then the other smaller ones.
