Dear Principal,

As an Eighth Grade student I feel that sports should be allowed to all students. Knowing that the students usually get C' s, you should let them be included in sports. I think that kid's should get at least a B in classes, but saying they cannot participate in sports makes them feel left out. Some kids are better at academics than sports and others are better at athletics. By having students involved in sports, I think it will have them feel better about themselves. If they feel better about themselves, they can possibly get better grades. I feel an adjustment to the rule can be students can start with a C average but if they can't bring up their grade by the third week of sports, they should be kicked off of the team.

Students should also be allowed to participate in other activities such as Student Government, Writing Club, and Drama. Again, some students are amazing in these fields and they won't be able to prove that if they have lower than a B. I personally know many talented people who don't do a good job in school, but excel at music, writing, and art. I am not disagreeing with you that a good education is not important, but sports and activities can help kids get more out of school.

I also feel that these sports and activities can be an escape for some people. Some play football to let go of their anger and others write to express themselves. Personally, I play sports to relax and write music in a way to let all my feelings out on paper. I am not alone in doing this. By telling students they need at least a B average, you are not letting them show what they are fully capable of.

I am asking you to please take this letter into consideration. You may agree or disagree with this letter but this is coming from the eyes of a student that cares about their peers. Thank you for reading this letter.

Sincerely,

An Eighth Grade Student
