Does asking for peoples advice on a matter help you or does it make the situation worse.

Well I believe that asking for some advice can have its pros and cons.

For example one pro can be that by asking for someone advice it can open up more ideas on the problem that plagues your mind, but a con can be that by adding a new idea into the situation, it could build up more stress and anxiety to get it done or solve the problem.

But I think in all honesty that getting more opinions can be good and make it easier for you to make best choice.

By listening to others opinions, the choice you have may broaden allowing you to make the best choice.

Which in turn could lead to more and more good choices in your future.

Another reason why asking for other peoples opinions, is that everyone has a different opinion, therefore has different ways to solve the same problem.

Trying to solve things on your own can lead to a complete disaster, so asking for others help can really make things less stressful and easier for you.

Also by asking for others opinions you can build trust between you an the people you ask.

By building more and more relationships, you have more and more people to talk to about your problems and can help you fix them.

When listening to other peoples opinion there maybe things you don't agree with, but you don't need to completely dismiss the idea instead you can let them finish voicing the idea then give your own spin to it.

By listening and not stopping them, you have helped to build your patience, listening skills, and your possible choices in the situation.

So you see by asking for others opinion you can, build new and better relationships, relieve stress, build important social skills, and see the bigger picture to choose the best course of action.
