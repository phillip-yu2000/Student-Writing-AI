Dear principle TEACHER_NAME,

I am highly concerned student from SCHOOL_NAME. There is a big issue that your school has, and we would like you to fix it. The issue is our inability to take part in sports activities if we have below a B average. Many of the students including me think this is unfair to the students. One of the main reasons is that a B average is above average which is a C. Many of your students in this school have a C which is expected of most students and is considered passing therefore the grade expectancy should be lowered to a c avrage. You may not feel that would be good enough for your students but it is the average for all schools in the country and the average grade your students in your school are getting.

Another concern of yours may be that the students in the sports program may slack at school if you lower the grade level. I can assure u that will not happen.

Many of my fellow students at our school take pride in our school work and never get below a C-, I suggest if they do that they should get some source of extra studying or tutoring to be able to stay in the sports activities we offer here.

It is a good reason also to allow C ranking students in because it keeps students busy. With out the program there would be a lot of your students getting in to trouble . Such as joining gangs and doing drugs or getting into fights Sports is a good source of virtue to students my age. Its good to have values you may acquire from sports instead of us being juvenile delinquents from bad choices you do when you have nothing better to do. You do not want those bad types of kids going to your school i presume ?
