Dear Senator,

It is the peoples right to vote on who represents our country, but why vote if you cannot choose the the direct candidate you want? I demand the electoral college to be abolished, it is a violation of the peoples right to vote for who they want. It is enough nonsesne of voting for someone to vote for you. Popular vote is the fairest way to vote, in lines 24 though 31 of the text, it exclaims that state committee's and candidates pick the electors. So candidates choose the electors that the people vote for? How do we know the candidates or committee's aren't sabataushing their power and picking the people they opinionly want, as opposed to whomever? We don't!

With the electoral college exsisting we are giving our power to other poeple that can vote for us. We are handing them free votes, so they can vote for who'm they'd like. That is not fair! They say that the most powerful person in the world is the people, but with the electoral college it has partially been robbed. In lines 26 through 27 of the text that supports the electoral college it states that "it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." That sentence proves to you that the people are incontrol of voting for their president.

Yes people may say that without the electoral college favoritism may appear in certain states and places. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that! There may be more voters for one candidate in a certain place, but as long as the people voted for whom they want there is no injustice.

In lines 17 through 18 of the text that supports the electoral college it states " that trust is rarely betrayed." RARELY? Meaning wrongful doing has happened between the lines of the electoral college, and are likely to happen again...Do not be blind to the electoral college's purpose. It is damaging the voting for our presidential election. Popular voting, where all equals and powers vote for the president they want.

Sincerely,
