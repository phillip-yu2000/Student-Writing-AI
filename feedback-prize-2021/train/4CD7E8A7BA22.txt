Cell phones while driving essay

Are cell phones a necessity while driving? They do account for a lot of distracted driving accidents leading to serious injuries and fatalities. So, the real question is, is it worth it? No, I believe cell phones should not be in use while driving.

There are multiple reasons why phones are a liability while driving more than an asset. I want to cover the most important reasons. First, distracted driving, specifically with phones leads to drivers being 57% more likely to be in an accident. That's more than half likely to potentially be in harms ways than before if you just simply put your phone down. Statistics also show that using your phone while driving decreases brain activity, focus, and depth perception by 37%, which are all necessary factors required to drive safely. Many people lose their lives, and risk others lives due to cell phone activity such as texting, playing music, phone calls, and more. This could be your life, or your sons or your daughters or anyone you love. All it takes its to put your phone down and wait!

Cell phone use while driving is even more common in the youth. Teens are 79% more likely to pick up their phone or any device while driving, then adults. The number 1 cause of teen deaths are motor vehicle accidents, majority caused by distracted driving. Phones being the primary source of these distractions cause horrific fatalities. Parents and guardians should strongly advise their children not to drive with their phone on, authority figures such as government officials, should ban any use of devices such as cell phones, to prevent as many accidents as possible, and save lives.

So is the cell phone worth it? Is it worth your life? Absolutely not, cell phones should not be used while driving, all it takes is to put the phone down, save your life, and others.
