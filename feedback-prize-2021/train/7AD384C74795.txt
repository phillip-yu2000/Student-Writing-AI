Dear State Senator,

Please take into consideration the following message.

I think that it would be better for our nation if the Electoral College was taken out of our system and instead let popular vote decide who wins. There are two main reasons I bring this argument to you. First, we pay taxes, we work hard, we put food on our tables, and we put a roof over our future voter's heads. We have absolutely no control of anything in this world. Letting us choose who gets to boss us around is something that we earned as US citizens. If you're going to kill us, atleast let us choose the weapon. Second, letting the popular votes decide who's president is a great way for all of us to get to know each other a little better, we may disagree but alteast that way we share our opinions and feelings and that is the foundation to a very happy nation and world.

Please consider all that I asked for, and I hope to see changes in my favor very soon.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME
