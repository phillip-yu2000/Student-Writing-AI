Is it okay to seek advice from multiple people ? Of course , in my opnion is is okay because everybody point of veiw is different from each other . Let's say he or she benefit from everyone advice and it actually better them as a human .It gives you options to choose from , so you can take the adivice that you think will better you . You get to see everyone perspective on the issue in ways you probably didn't look at it .

Some people can better their self with multiple varities of advice . Recieving advice from a generous amount of people can give you options to pick from , and then you can think about which one is going to help you the most . Since you are recieving different varities advice you can pick the best one or ones to apply to your life . I prefer to seek advice from an generous amont of people .

However , you should consider every piece of advice you get even if it's from the unexpected . Sometimes it's good to look at the advice they have gave you from an different perspective . It can also be an eye opener to you . Also , makes you think about the situation in a way you thought of never about it as . Looking at the issue in a different way because of advice can better you just from the advice from different perspectives .

In conclusion , you should get advice from multiple people . If getting advice from different perspectives help you better yourself then get advice from multiple individuals .
