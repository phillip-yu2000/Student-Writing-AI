I think students should not be able to take classes at home. Because is not going to benefit them with their work. Sometimes students dont know how to do their assignment assigned. Students need to communicate with others to gain more experience.

a lot of students needs help with one person to support them with their work. Some students are not smart enough to work by their-self. If students take classes at home they might have some issues.

For example from my point of view I think students should come to school. Because is more helpful for them they get help from their teachers. They communicate with others share their thoughts. If their having problems with their assignment they can ask for help.

however some students are not agree to come to school because they might not like to wake up early every morning or deal with others. Some students have bad attitudes and they dont like been with others or forced to talk. But it is more important to come to school because it benefits you gain more experience.
