Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm going to be straight and to the point, our students should be able to use their phones during free time and lunch periods, I do first agree that it has become a big enough problem to do something about the cell phones, but doing a way with them is not good idea it was already a rule not to use them during class, but they use them anyway what would a policy saying to never bring your phones to school do, we don't have the man power or time, or even rights to search them and no doubt a majority will still bring them anyway and disrupt class and their own learning, but if give them two times within the day when no learning is taking place to text or talk on the phone this will give time the time they need to get their socializing out before schooling.

If we give them some freedom they will come back and give us what we want, and in that case it's a winning situation for everyone. I

can say myself I would learn better if this was the new policy Now if students disregard this new rule then disciplinary action goes as follows 1st time caught using device outside of free zones then a warning is issued, 2nd time and you get detention, 3rd time you lose the privilege for 9 weeks and detention, 4th will be decided by you the principal. If you go with the policy i have brought up, you will become more popular with the students and gain more respect giving you more lead into new rules you apply. it's said that if you give students more freedom of choice the can pay attention more and stay awake and alert during class. When students are distracted by these things like texting, talking on the phone they become distracted, and use food as a source of getting out of conversation or of being bored, which means more money will be spent on food, which is more money for the school.

The only non benefits i can think of from this plan is that students might still use their phones in class but discipline could take care of those problems, so the plan is almost flawless.
