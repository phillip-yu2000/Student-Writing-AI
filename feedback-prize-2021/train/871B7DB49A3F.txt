Dear Principal,

I do not agree with your idea of changing the school policy to have a B average to participate in sports. As you know right now the policy is a C average and i think that is a great grade average. I can see why you might want to change it, maybe its because kids would work harder and try to bring their grades up to a B, which would be a lot better and they would learn a lot more. But i don't think that that is a very great idea because, a lot of kids wouldn't make the team or they wouldn't get to play as much because their grades were not as high as they were suppose to be. I know some students that try really hard to get good grades but they just don't get school. So if this student was getting a C average and then he couldn't go out for sports then i think his self esteem would go down really low.

Also some kids might just be lazy and not even try out because they think it would be to much work to get a B average. If this was the case then your sports teams would start going down, your teams wouldn't be very good, and my guess would be that some students would just stop trying to get good grades because they don't see the reasons of why grades are important because he doesn't have anything to work to.

In our class there is around 30 students and about 23 of them do sports, and of that 23 my guess would be that around 10-15 of the students that do sports have a C average, so if you were to change it to a B average then these students would not be able to do sports or they would just have to start working a lot harder. I know from experience that it is hard and stressful to get an A and some of these students think that it is stressful and hard to get a C.

This is why i think you should leave the grade average the way it is.

Sincerely,
