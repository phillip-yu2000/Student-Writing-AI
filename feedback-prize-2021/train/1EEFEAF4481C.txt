Why is advice important?

Advice can be important in multiple ways It can help you in life, sports, jobs, chores, and even fulltime jobs. Advice can help everyone in life, it has helped me alote in sports, it has helped me get better at basketball over the past 2 years I proceed to get better every year I play, Because I get a new coach every year and I get new advice and I get better by using that advice.

Advice for life is one of the more important than other advice.

Advice for life can be used everyday no matter what your doing, I think that older people would give the best advice because they have lived longer and have expierienced more in their life. Another reason advice is good for life is because goood advice can help you be a better person in the world and in our community.

When people ask for advice it is good to have multiple choices of advice and to have advice from multiple people.

Multple choices of advice is good because if you have more advice than you can use more of it in your life and could help you more. The more people you ask you will get more advice that you can you can you and you can use that advice to help others that maybe struggle with certain things like sports and that could help them alot in life.
