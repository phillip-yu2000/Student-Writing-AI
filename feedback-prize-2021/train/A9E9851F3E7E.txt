Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some parents think it is a good idea for students to stay at home for education. Students should not attend classes from home. Here are the three reasons why students should not attend classes from home.

The first reason is students are just wasting time at home doing work, but they are really just playing video games or watching T.V. Also Most of the students that are home schooled can easily get distracted from Cellular devices too. What if the students have siblings, they might not have the time to do there work on time. Students at home may not have any connection. So, students will not be able to do any homework.

The second reason is students can struggle with homework. Students can focus on doing there homework or class work. But what if students are blind and can not do any work at home. If a student is blind, parents would have to hire or contact someone to help that blind student at home for some help. A student from a different country may not speak English. That also can be a struggle for a parent or gaurdian because they might not be able to afford classes at home.

The third reason is wasting money on books or classes. Most states have classes for free books or classes, but some other states might not. Parents might have not have the money for the classes or for the books. But wasting money on classes or books is not a good idea. Parents have to pay bills but what if the student needs the money for the classes.

Some schools offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home or by video conferencing. Parents may think it is a good idea for students to stay home for education at home. Students should never attend distance learning for there education.
