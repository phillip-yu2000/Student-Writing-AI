No matter wich candidate has the most votes The Electoral College holds the final decission. Even though this makes it unfair to our voters this is a secure way of choosing the next president. Sometimes we are not smart enough to pick the right candidate ourselves. I believe that we should rely on the Electoral College. It is there to make sure that we do not get a president that might over rule and it also avoids run-off elections.

The Electoral College reduces the chance of getting a president that might have intentions of over powering. For instance in Cuba, nothing like The Electoral College exists which is why Fidel Castro is still in charge and does not give the citizens freedom. Although he may not be in full charge, he still rules through his brother. But because of him they have poor food supply, barely any money, shelter is weak, and food is scares. With the Electoral College this would be less likely to happen because the electors process everything before making the final decision. Like stated in Source number three "voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates".

"Candidates may have won the popular vote but not won the presidency" says source two. This makes it unfair to voters. On top of that, The Electoral College avoids Run-off elections. "Avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast" says Source three. Nixon and Clinton for example had fourty-three percent of the popular votes. For a candidate who can not run their state The Electoral College may turn off voters. When candidates seem to be tied or are about to be tied it complecates the process and so it is reduced by The Electoral College.

I support The Electoral College becuase of the reduced chance of getting a president with over powering intentions and it avoids run-off elections.
