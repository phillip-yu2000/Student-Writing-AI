Dear Principal,

Keeping our community clean is a big issue and should have some thought put into it ,but not by our students. We got to school to learn basic skills such as: Math, reading, science and social studies; not how to clean up.

Students should not be required to perform community service because it is time consuming. Even a person like you should be able to understand that. Students have homework to do, projects to complete, and other things to do with our lives.

Instead of cleaning up our neighborhood park, we could be working on school work. Teachers are always complaining on how we should do our work, but if we are to busy cleaning up how will we ever finish it ?

Students should not have to do community work also because that is not our responsibility. Right now,

being in the time that we're in, economically, shouldn't we be trying to create more jobs for people ? Instead of students having to clean up on the side of the road, get someone who's going to be paid for it. Then we would all be happy.

Although we should want our community clean, it's just not our job to do so. It is a great idea, but wrong perspective. So, again I say, us students should not have to perform community service.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
