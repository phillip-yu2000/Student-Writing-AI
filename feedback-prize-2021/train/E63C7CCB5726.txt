In world war 2 the UNRRA hired the "seagoing cowboys" to take care of animals such as cows,horses,mules and other animals.

Now if you ike animals and want to take care of them on certain occations then join the seagoing cowboys."The cattle-boat trips were unbelieveable for a kid" Luke said.

They travel alot and they see alot of places and travling can be sometimes intresting and fun.

It doesnt take that long to get to these places ethier, it only takes about a month because they are on a boat.

Now some people think thats long but it's really not.

They got to china from somewhere in the atlantic ocean in a month.

Not to long right.

The cowboys go to places for jobs and then the play games or go siteseeing its not all just work they have a ton of fun.

The cowboys liked to have fun too.

After unloading the animals they play baseball,volleyball,table tennis,and they read and box.

This can give you great oppertunities as an adult and a kid.

Some of it wont be fun you will have cetain jobs, but sometimes it's better to do hard work instead of play. From what ive said so far are you intrested?

Some of the jobs are even fun and majestic.

If your a watchmen you get a majstic site of what your around.

If theres danger your going to be the hero because you would warn your team about everything that is going on and tell them to turn around.

In some of these jobs you get to work with anaimals and that could be fun because you really dont do alot of work.

The most you have to do in that job is clean the animals and feed them thats it.

Now to me being a seagoing cowboy sounds like an awsome and fun job.
