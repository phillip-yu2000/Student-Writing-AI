After reading the article on the Facial Action Coding System, I believe the use of this technology could be very valuable. With the help of a computer identifying wether a persons emotion shows sadness, confusion and etc., the help of this technology can educate students in different ways. For example, if the computer recognizes a student is confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This invention could completely change the way teachers teach and help them understand how a student feels about a topic. Just by looking into this advanced computer, it can improve your skills and help you better understand the topic.

Using this new invention can impact the way students are learning and determine if they are a slower learner than others. The technology can easily modify the lesson if it recognizes a confused emotion on your face. Students may tend to find themselves further educated with the use of facial recognition just by showing a single emotion and the way your facial features are moved.

In conclusion, I believe the use of this technology in schools can change the way teachers are educating their students. It can also notify teachers if a student is struggling on a certain topic if the teachers can view that the lesson had to be modified on a students laptop. I believe with the help of this technology, students will become more informed with school topics.
