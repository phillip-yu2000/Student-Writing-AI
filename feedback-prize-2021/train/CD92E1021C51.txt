Driverless cars could change the world. If we had cars that could do the driving for us, we could avoid wrecks and traffic jams. Googles driverless cars have drove over half a million miles without a single crash! Having driverless cabs would be amazing, especially if they took up less gas.

If we didnt have to worry about things like wrecks and traffic jams, life in cities could become much easier. Driving would become much more effecient if we didnt have to worry about human error. We could get to places much faster and safer.

The driverless cab idea would be amazing if we had the technology to do that. We need to be able to make driverless cars safer before being able to legalize them in the states. I'm sure in time that we will reach the technology. Once they are completely safe then there will be no reason for it to be illegal.

Being able to notify a driver in a sticky situation would be helpful as well. They could help us be more aware of our surroundings. Maybe they could even see blindspots.

Overall I think that driverless cars would be very usefull to us. It would make driving much safer, especially in crowded roads like cities. It could even make getting to places faster. Being able to see blindspots when driving could also help avoid many wrecks.
