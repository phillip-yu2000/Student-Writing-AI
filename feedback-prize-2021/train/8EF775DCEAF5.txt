Although having more advice is better than one person advice. When you ask for advice you got to trust that, that person to not give you bad advice or lie to you and tell you bad advice.

After you gain advice from your friends,family members or others you could trust that will give good advice . You could us that advice to see if that would be a great idea for your choice on your situation . With how you want to execute that problem and or situation you might have .
