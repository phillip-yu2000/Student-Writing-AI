Dear Editor:

I personally believe that if students brought their cell-phones to school and were able to use them during lunch and other free opportunities that this would be best. It would be best because students could call their families, and if they had them out at lunch they would not use them in class, also students would be better listeners. Students in the end that listen better, are better students.

If students were aloud to have their phones out during lunch and free periods it would be best because they could call their families. this would be nice because they could ask if they would ride the bus after school or if their parents would pick them up. Also, if a student plays sports for the school they could call their parents if practice or a game was canceled. This I believe would be an over all good idea.

Secondly, if students were aloud to have their cell phones out at lunch they would most likely not use them in class. The reason being for this is that students could get everything they wanted done at lunch. There they could text or call their friends and family. The ending result being that the teacher would have better listeners and less distractions.

Lastly I believe that if students were aloud to use cell phones at lunch you have a distraction free environment. Students could actually get their work in class done and would understand subjects better. The teacher would also not have to repeat things more than once. All in all this is a great idea.

In conclusion I believe that if students were aloud to use phones during lunch and other free times they would be less of a distraction. Students could first, call their families, second, most likely not use them in class, and third, students would be better listeners. So in the end, this is my belief.
