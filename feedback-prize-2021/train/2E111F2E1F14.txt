Would you ever consider giving up your car? No, well you probably should since it seems to be the trend these days, and there's seemingly countless advantages of limiting car usage. Acording to The End of Car Culture, we hit our driving peak in 2005, and the amount of miles driven has been going down steadily. There has also been a large drop in how many 16- to 39-year-olds are getting a license, while older people are likely to retain their licenses as they age as was stated in Mr. Sivak's research.

With the amount of car usage going down other things are taking place and helping shape our future, as Mimi Sheller says, "Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift. As said in The End of Car Culture, Instead of driving to meet and talk to people, we have the internet that makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected, unlike the tense, stressed feelings cars give you as shown with Heidrun Walters response to having gotten rid of his car, "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."

Cars dont only create stress, they also produce large amounts of smog. As stated in the article, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, up to 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions are caused by passenger cars. All of the smog is destroying the ozone layer and causing major problems such as global warming.

Limiting car usage can be a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution, as Carlos Arturo Plaza says. Cars not only destroy the health of your enviroment by doing damage to the air around you, they also do damage to your brain and cause you to stress and feel tense over imaginary things.
