Dear Principal,

I think it's a great idea to require the students to have at least a B average to participate in school activities. It encourages the students to work hard in school and be rewarded with the things that they love. If students were required to have a B average or above to take part in school activities, they would be happy about participating in the activities, and their parents and teachers would be happy about their good grade.

This new policy would be a great motivator and would also help teach your students about responsibility. It will teach them how to organize their priorities and recognize which things in life are more important than others, such as doing well in school before playing sports.

With this new policy, you would also be preparing your students for the future. As they enter high school and college, they need to realize that the real world is tough, and to have a good job and better life in the future, they need to do well in school. This rule change would help prepare them for that.

Overall, this new policy is a fantastic idea and I think that you should carry it out. It would really make the students push themselves academically, and make the school look better too. This new rule would be a great addition to our school, so please consider it.

Sincerely,
