Dear Principal ,

I believe that students should be able to bring their cell phones into the school building. I believe that they should be able to use their cell phones at lunch or a free period.

It's a good way to let the students have fun and learn at the same time . But they should not be allowed to use their cell phones in class , because this will cause a distraction to them and other students. If this become a school policy , the students might even appreciate you and other teachers for letting them use their phones and have free time . This will also be a good thing that will let the students know that you appreciate the efforts and hard work that they do whether it's an after school activity or just class work. Students may even think that , since the teachers and principal are letting us take the advantage of using our cell phones at lunch or a free period , then we should show them that we are really grateful and satisfied by working more and improving well . They might even reward you with something because this doesn't often happen at many schools. Some schools are zero tolerance and very strict. But to really make the student do their best is to give them a break or free time to show you really care. Pressuring and making the students do something won't make them want to do it. It'll just tell them that , this school is boring and say things like I don't want to go here anymore . Or maybe they won't even recommend that particular school to others. So

I believe that this is a great way to make the students think positive and say great things about your school to others and maybe they would want to join your school .
