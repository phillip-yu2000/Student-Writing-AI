Seeking multiple opinions can help some make a better choice. People often ask for advice from multiple people because they want some one to agree with there choice. We often ask for opinions from multiple people because we want to see if they have a different perspective on a certain choice. We want someone to be honest with us.

We always want a second opinion. Us as humans want someone to agree with are decisions. Sometimes we dont think it's a great choice,but when other people agree with are choice we gain confidence. I remember when I was younger I asked my mom if my pink sparkly dress looked cute with my red shoes and she said " yes ladybug it dose" and I went to school thinking I looked like the next Hannah Montana but really I looked like a clown. Her opinion on the outfit gave me confidance .

Asking other people there perspective on certain choices changes your perspective on chocies. Everyone thinks in different ways. when someone shares there opinion with you and the reason they agree or disagree. You start to see,think and act on there opinion. They bring new input that you would of never thought of. Sometimes we don't think of situation or action that may effected are choice but when another person makes us aware of this we change are aspect on are choices.

Humans like honesty we want some to tell us that are choice is the perfect decision or to tell us that are decision may not be so great after all. When someone is honest on an opinion we know we can count on the fact that they will tell us the truth. When we get this opinion we like to think on how it will affect are choice. If it will lead us to make the best choice?

Making a better choice can come from the help of multiple peoples opinion.
