When you make a decision without advice, you are trusting that you have enough background knowledge to make a wise choice. When you ask more than one person for advice you are expanding your knowledge so you can make a better choice. The more people you ask, the more knowledge you have of a situation. Everyone has some advice to give, it might even be worth your while to find out what that is. Just remember to check for bias when asking multiple people.

As an example, you go to the store to buy your favorite product, but someone tells you it is cheaper at another store. You can make the best choice by asking someone else what they think, this saves time when you find out that it is not cheaper. When listening to someone else'sÂ advice make sure you listen for bias. If that person who told you it was cheaper here than at the other store, then they might have been bias against the other store. They would lie to you so you would avoid the other store.

Every person sees from a different set of eyes, we all have a different view for every situation. When asking for advice you should always consult more than one person. If they have some different insight to a situation, they will share that knowledge with you, helping you make better choices. Those choices could help you reach your goals or even reach the stars
