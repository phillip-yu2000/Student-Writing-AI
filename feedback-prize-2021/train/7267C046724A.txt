Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 would be a good decision for the school. In many cases students must use their phones for after-school activities and it might become a problem if the students do not have their phones with them at school. Most parents often feel safer when their children have their phones with them at school. So in my opinion, it should be the parents decision if they want to allow their child to bring their phone to school or not.

A big deal for teachers is that the students are paying attention to their phones and not the lesson in class. With this policy it would allow the students to be able to socialize without doing it in class and disturbing others. This policy states that they would only be allowed phone use during free times and then turned off during class, so the teachers should not mind this situation.

Another thing is safety. In the case of an emergency these students would be able to help contact emergency services or simply call their parents to inform them that something has gone wrong. If you decide to go with Policy 2 these students would not be able to contact their parents at all until they get back to their phone. This could cause many problems for many people.

It seems like everyone uses a phone, may that be texting or calling or getting information. Policy 1 would let students be able to do these things at school during appropriate times. In my view point, there is not anything that would seem to go wrong in this situation.

I have heard of other schools having this routine before so I do not see why it would not work for this school as well. I think, personally, that Policy 1 would be a good choice to have at this campus. Teachers would not mind, parents would feel safer and the students at this school would enjoy this privilege. Please consider my opinion in your decision.

Sincerely,

Student
