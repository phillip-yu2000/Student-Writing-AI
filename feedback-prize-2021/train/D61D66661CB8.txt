Many kids should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program will help other kids, and adults, to be more aware of people in other countries and their needs. This can open up the world for everyone in many ways.

In this case, this program helped Luke find time to have fun on board. The cowboys played many different sports at this program.

They played sports in empty holds where animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tounaments, fencing, boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time for the Seagoing Cowboys when there was nothing to do. This was cool.

Some children might not want to go to this program, but if they do go then they would have a great opportunity to experience what it is like to do new things that they have never done before. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure for everyone. Even for Luke Bomberger.

This program is helpful for young children to get a chance to discover many things, and it will give them a chance to make outstanding, new friends to hangout and play with, too. Anyone who wants to become a Seagoing Cowboy, can travel to this camp and have a really great time there. Also, anyone can even visit many unique places.
