My opinion on driverless cars, i think it would be a stupid idea because i love to drive and im sure there are alot of other people who love to drive. Driverless cars could be a big problem, what if a driverless car had a malfunction and could wreck and kill somebody. Im sure the goverment would disagree with this idea because they love to make money, and all the money to make driverless cars would be outrageous, and that could make the goverment go in dept and it could ruin alot of things.

No details support my position because im against it, like i said i love to drive and i wanna be able to go wherever i want in the future and not have to worry about not having my own car because driverless cars just sound stupid. What if these driverless cars have a malfunction and just took off on its own i wanna be able to have my own car and drive on my own, because what if i end p getting a audi gr im sure ill be the one wanting to drive by myself and like i said everyone loves driving so i really dont like the idea.

These people who make the driverless cars such as nissan and audi, how do they know they can even make these cars to where it wont wreck on its own, or get us to where we need to go, the only thing i think would be cool about it is if i am tired and im driving and i need to go to sleep and the car could drive on its own, but what if a deer jumped in front of the car and the car is going 60 mph the car isnt just going to stop your going to wreck. If they really wanna make these cars they need to have good protection like a tank or sometin because that would be safe. Im still against it but it would be pretty cool to see what they can really do in the future.
