Sometime when people ask for advice, they tend to get nerves cause there coming to you with a problem or a situation that they need help with and probably dont want to talk about. But most of the time they go to many people cause they dont know what to do in whatever problem they have. I think going to many people is a good idea cause what if all of there ideas can help you. You can chose witch ever idea of advice you like."I also think that if you go to maybe a older person that they will be able to help more with what ever cause they might have good experience with your situation". So in conclusion I think going to many people even old people is a good idea cause they will probably give you good advice on what you need help with. and not to be scared with going up to people for advice cause the worst thing to be scared of is not getting any help back with what your problem. Thats why i think it good to ask for advice.
