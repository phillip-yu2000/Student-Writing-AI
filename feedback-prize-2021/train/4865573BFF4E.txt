Dear Senator,

Change is not always a good thing. The Electoral College being changed is definetly not right. Many may be persuaded by fleeting emotions into a strong desire for changing the Electoral College. This however isn't as good an idea as people may think it is. It's unnessecary to fix something that isn't broken.

The Electral College so far as been working extremly well. Its a benificial system that our founding fathers created. The Electoral College has kept balance and silenced the chaotic voices of the citizens. According to source 3, "A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote." This is a fact because the human mind is fragile and tends to let anger or ego get the better of them. This will then be the cause of uneeded casualties.

A lot of people find the idea of changing the Electoral College to be satisfing. In thier mind's this will make things more "fair". Source 2 implies that, "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." Many will believe this because their not able to see the big picture. The Electoral college as stated in source 1, "is a process, not a place." It's not about being unfair or cheating. The electoral college is valid system that has allowed the election of a president to go as smoothly as possible and it is in every way superior to the popular vote method.

So let's be realistic and leave things as it is. Comparing popular vote to the electoral college is like comparing a newborn baby to an adult. The fact of it is that the electoral college is the more reasonable method to use whereas popular vote is unreasonable because it'll only give birth to more problems. The Electoral College has been and still is the best method to elect a president for our great country.

Your's Sincerly,
