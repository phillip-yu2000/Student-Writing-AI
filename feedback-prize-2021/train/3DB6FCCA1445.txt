To Principal

Our students should not be allowed to have cell phones at school. They might use them in class and receive calls in class. This would disrupt the class and some student care about there school work. Others will just be texting or talking to somebody else in class. All the cell phone does is create an easier way for bully's to get a hold of some of the other students. They will call them names of tell them they're going to beat them up. But for girls it would be kind of a different story. Most would start rumors and the rumors would spread much faster. Girls can be bully's to. With some of the student you might see there grades staring to go down because they don't pay attention in class. The teachers would all ways be sending in students cause the were not paying attention. The only bad thing about this is the students that don't have phones might have their grades going down to from the noise the other students make while they use their cell phones.

Instead of study time they would just read a couple of lines and then start to use their cell phones. Yet again people might bother the people that don't use them during class.

Sincerely, Student body president
