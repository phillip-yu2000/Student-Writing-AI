Being a Seagoing Cow is great way to get to know and see more things about other countries. In this draft I will talk about why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. When you become a Seagoing Cowboy you are helping others and at the same time you are having fun. When you arrive at your destination you are not only delivering goods but you are seeing many amazing buildings, landmarks, statues, and more.

Being a seagoing cowboy is hard work but it is for the greater good, as in helping others during World War Two. A way to start can be by getting offered by a friend or offering a friend. After the War, people in different countries needed supplies, and fast, so a Seagoing Cowboy could get the jobs done. Making the world a better place is a good thing to do. Plus when you do so you feel good that you have done something that has helped others.

When you are done dropping off your load you have a lot of extra time on the way back so you can play games like table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fensing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass the time. Traveling all around the world can show you that a lot of countries are in need of food and help.

It will take a while to cross the sea to where you are going, and if you have animals on the ship you have to feed almost all animals two or three times a day. Ypu have to be up for the hard work of cleaning animal stalls, feeding animals, night shift watching, and more.

I hope you want to become a Seagoing Cowboy, and enjoyed the draft. That's what I have to say about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy and why you should become one.
