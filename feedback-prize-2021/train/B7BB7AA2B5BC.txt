In my opinion driverless cars are a liitle more on the sketchy side in my opinion because you have to put a lot of trust into a machine.

Especially if in the future they make these cars in a factory where not a lot of time is spent of each car specifically, then a lot could go wrong.

It would help decrease pollution though which is one of this world's biggest problems right now.

Though this new concept of driverless cars would decrease pollution, there are sure many more ways that we could decrease pollution without a machine that are sketchy to put anybody in.

Such as in paragraph 7, it states that a human that is riding in the car must stay alert for any zones that calls for tough navigating and situations.

Some of these cars do watch the driver as they take over the wheel to make sure they are alert and stay awake through the process.

Overall my opinion on driverless cars is that I don't think it's the best option in the world because you do have to put a lot of trust into them.

A lot of car manufacturers have been working to improve these cars over the years, but if it came down to it, I guess we all would have to come together and make these cars as efficient as possible.
