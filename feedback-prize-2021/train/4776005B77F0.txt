It is better to have multiple responses than just one. Because whats the point of having one answer when you could have multiple. You can also go base off of people advice instead of listing to just one person tell you somthing. And lastly it would make you think on your options for advice if multiple people give you advice.

You can also have a way better answer. On what you do for advice and how you would get more. Like I said befor one is worse than alot of people. And finnaly one person can't give you as much knowledge or the best advice as multiple people can.

It is most likely you would get the best advice from multiple people. also it is like having fun and i'll tell you why. Let me give you an example who would want to go to the park with one person to have fun when it could be all your freinds there to have fun with you. Or why play video games with just person whe you can have your whole freind group play to.
