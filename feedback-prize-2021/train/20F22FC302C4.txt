The automobile has been around for decades but it's only now that we can see the devastating effects car emissions have on the ozone layer. With the obvious change in the environment, people are starting to use cars less. If people would limit their car usuage there would be less polution and happier people.

Car pollution is probably the number one disadvantage to car usage. In 2014, Paris had to ban people from using their cars because the smog was too bad. "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the global city." Limiting car usuage in Paris would be very benficial for their people and enviornment.

In sources one and three though they had the right idea about the advantages of limiting car usuage. In Germany, one suburb is car free and residents reported to be happier than when they did have cars. In Bogota, there was a large turn out of people to particpate in their car free day. A business man says " It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution".

The automoblie maybe out the door anyway. In source four, "driving by young people decreased twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009." Less and less people are getting their licenses and more people are starting to take the public transportation and carpool. This is really significant because itt's the young people that are gonna live with decisionn that are mad today.

Car limting advantages out weigh the disadvantages. More care free cities and days and more people riding bikes and taking public transportation and carpooling can lead to many great advantages. Some of the advantages would be less air pollution and happier people.
