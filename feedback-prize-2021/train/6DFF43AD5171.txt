Dear Principle,

I think we should have cell phones in school all time but have to be put on silent and in your pocket.

It would be nice to use phones during lunch time and free time.

But the phones to have to be turned off during the day because we could just put them on silent and know one would if you have it on or not.

What's it going to hurt if you have it on silent or if you could use it when the teacher is not giving incrustation to the class.

Because cell is another way to communicate with you friends instead for calling them you could just text them.

Also at lunch you could just text your friends with out going over to them and talking it's much easy to do that.

If the teachers don't let you have your phone in class that's dumb because people love there cell phones and use them all the time and teachers take them away because your not supposed to have them out but if you could have them when she/he is not talking or doing a lesson so we should be allowed to use them in those reasons and if them give homework do the homework first and then use your phone as long as you have permission to use them.

So really both of them are not the greatest policy's in the world I don't agree with either one of the policy's I agree with the one I just wrote, just not having phones in school is dumb and only having them your at lunch and other free time that's boring.

Come on if the teachers have them out why cant we?

Are there just better than us and can do what they want.

So for that i think we have them out when teachers and not giving incrustations or giving out homework thank you for taking the time to read this

Sincerely,
