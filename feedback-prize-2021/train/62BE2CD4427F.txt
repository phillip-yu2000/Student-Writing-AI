dear principal i think you should allow us to have our cell phones during our free time at school. if you have an emergency. you need to call your parents and you can't get to the office u can just use your cell phone. if you have them off in class then you can't cheat but you need to call someone you need help. it boring without cell phones. you should be allowed to have electronics on campus. what a life if you can't have fun. cell phones should be allowed on but off when in class. if your cell is on in class then you are in big trouble. the policy that we have right now is stupid but it the schools policy so we have to follow it. we should have what is best for the students that is to have cell phones in school. My cell phone is my life. i keep all my important stuff on it.
