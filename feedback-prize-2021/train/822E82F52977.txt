If technology knows when you are mad, or frustrated the computer would know that and the computer would alert the teacher then, the teacher would know you were probably frustrated because you were struggling. Say a student was scared or nervous to ask the teacher for help, the teacher would get the alert from the computer saying the student is frustrated.

Last, technology will tell you if the student is happy. This will help because, if students are happy with an assignment that means they are getting it and they know what they're doing. The teacher will get an alert saying students are haptpy then that means they are enjoying the assignment or lesson. If everyone is happy it looks good on students and teachers.
