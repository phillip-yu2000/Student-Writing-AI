This new found technology is outstanding and can do marvellous things, however, it is not needed for students in the classroom.

I feel that it would not be as beneficial to students as the author makes it sound. At some point this technology may be helpful for counselors of schools but it is not for daily classroom use.

I am not saying that this technology is not an innovation. It is a tremendous breakthrough to the world of technology. And it could be beneficial to some professions and aspects of life, like psychology, but it just does not apply to students in the same way. The author says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor".

This is not true.

The only way that this could be true is if we replaced human teachers with computers, and that, i think, is a huge step in the wrong direction.

Technology is helpful to the world but to much of it may be a problem that is irreversable.

Furthermore, I think that this technology could be very helpful to high school counselors. With the emotional reader the counselors will be able to identify cases of depression or anxiety or other mental disorders found in high school easier.

In the article it states, "we humans perform this same impressive "calculation" every day". This is referring to the calculating the computer does. It says that we do that to which is true but we are not nearly as precise or efficient. That is why we need this technology or something like it for counselors, to lighten their burdens, but to also ensure that their job gets done.

Finally, I believe that the installation of emotionally sensing computers to every classroom would be a mistake. However, putting them in the hands of counselors would be brilliant. I think that the world should look into this technology more and decide the best uses for it.
