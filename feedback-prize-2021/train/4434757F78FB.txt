The Face on Mars has been a pop icon for years. Many people believe that the Face on Mars is made by aliens. The Face on Mars is a natural landform and was not created by aliens. The evidence that proves this is true is there is another landform just like it on Earth and there are detailed pictures that show it is just a natural landform.

The first evidence that shows it is just a landform is the fact that there is another natural landform like that on Earth. The picture shows an equivalent to a butte or messa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. The text says, "'It reminds me of the most Middle Butte in the Snake Plain of Idaho,'...about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"

This quote is giving a clear example of someone saying that the Face is like a natural landform on Earth. If it is like something that is made on Earth naturally, that means it could probably made naturally on Mars too. There is another great piece of evidence showing that it is a natrual landform.

Another piece of evidence that proves the Face is a natural landform is that there are detailed pictures that show it is all natural. In 2001 NASA could take pictures with each pixel thats spans 1.56 metes, which is very detailed for the technology we have. The text says, "'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'" This example goes to show that NASA took a picture using the best resolution they had on their cameras to show and see the fact that it is not alien made and is all naturally made.

Many people believe the Face on Mars is made by aliens but that is not true at all. The Face is just a natural landform. The evidence that goes to prove it is the fact that there is another landform just like it on Earth and there are detailed pictures that show it is just a natural landform.
