To me reading people emotion expression of students in a classroom is valuable, because not everyone would tell there probles to their friends or familly therefore the new technology to read people emotion is a good thing,

is good for everyone . We need all our emotion for thinking, problems solving, and focused attention. In the other hand by reading other people emotions would help you figure out on how to help them focus more , because every human bein are neurobologically wired, and to learn anything , our minds most be focus and our emotions need to feel balance. In the article it say's " the process begins when the computer model of the face ; all major muscles in the model must move like human muscles . In the article 6 it say's'' by the way did making a happy face in this experimrnt also make you feel sligtly happy?'' To me putting a happy face just because you fake in it or not trying to let other people figured is not a bad thing however it can also be bad because on the inside you not happy , so therefore i think using technology is better good thing to figure people out.
