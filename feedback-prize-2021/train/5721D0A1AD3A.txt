Driverless car are becoming more likely to be bought then any other car. They have been given speical quanities that draws the buys attention to. In cars like Audis, Nissans, etc they have become more likely that buyers wants. Has anyone ever though of what happened if a snsor didnt ctahc something whose fault would it be the person or the car, what if the automatic breaks didnt completely stopped the car and the person hit something whose fault would it be. I believe Driverless cars are not the greatest Development.

In some peoples eyes driverless cars can be the greatest thing or maybe not so great to evryone. Many people over the years have had sudden mishabs of something that wasnt there fault or maybe someone elses. driver less cars are starting to become very too expensive. Driverless cars are starting to mess with peoples mind, maybe having scensors and cameras everywhere along with automatic breaks but has anyone sat back and realzied how much this would cost. many people need to pay attention to whats going on, on the road and not just have a car do it for them.

Ever since the 1980s cars like this have been invented every year and more and more have gotten more advanced and more epensive. Automation is becoming a more major challenge according to Dr. Werner Huber. Many people want more entertainment and information systems and hope that there car will be successful by having things. People should take there own responsibility by driving there own car and realizing safety is a huge concern.
