Imagine having to argue about keeping the Electoral College or changing to Election by popular vote for the president of the United states of America. which one would you choose? If i had to choose I Would pick to Abollish the electoral college because it effects who president, confuse people and  candidates don't spend enough time in the states.

The first reason why I said that we should abolish the electoral college is because it effects who can become president. In passage two it said that "in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency"."Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. And yet , the electoral college still has its defenders. what gives?

The second reason why I said that we should Abolish  the electoral college is because it  confuse people. when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the  presidency I bet  a lot of people were confused. Most people would have pefered a direct election to the one we have now.

The last reason why I said that we should Abolish the electoral college is because  candiates don't spend enough time in the states. what i mean by that is that is because of the winner take all system they know that they don't have a chance of winning. In the passage it said that during the 2000 campaig, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

In conclusion the reason why we should abolish the electoral college is because it effects who becomes president, it confuses people, and candiates dont't spend enough in the states. Now that i told you my reason don't you think the same.
