In my opinion i am againest the driverless cars. Why because to me the cars aren't safe yet. I think if we use dirverless cars there would be so many accidents. The cars won't know what to do. Even in the article it says the cars that they have devolpoed aren't even completely driverless. It says that the cars can steer,accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.

Other reasons why i am againest the driverless cars is because all the cars the world has made what are they going to do with them. If they keep making driverless cars all the regular cars are no longer going to be in use. That's going to be a lot of money people have wasted on a car that no one is using anymore. Another reason why i am againest the driverless cars is because people might not feel safe to ride in them. Honestly would you want a car to be driving for you on the highway late at night. No the driverless cars aren't safe yet .They can cause a lot of accidents and problems for you and the company that makes them.

So this is it my final thoughts on the driverless cars. I say they should not make these cars because they are going to be a waste on money. Instead of using the driverless cars we can use the money on many more important things that the world needs. Like in the passage it says that only a safe car has a human driver in control at all times. So that's all i have to say about driverless cars. We should not make them but use that technology and money on something else.
