Computer driven cars, the future of cars, but is it safe or dangerous. i think dangerous for three reasons. first off what if the computer driven car malfunctions or is even hacked. secondly will they make new driving laws for these computer driven cars. and last but not least if its safe then why is it illegal.

Computer are the future,but is it for cars. Computer driven cars can be quiet dangerous. What if the car malfuntions. Feor example, your driving in the woods heading for your camping spot, but the car dosen't want to turn. Your heading for a tree and you cant pull the stearing wheel what happens next? Or what if your car is bieng hacked by an unkown person. how would the car company fix it.

Will they make new driving laws? As stated in the story"New laws will be in order to cover liability in case of an accident". "Who is held responsible the driver or the manufature". In the story it states "Presntly, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the safe car has a human driver in controlat all times". I know here already tired of the regular driving laws.

If computer driving cars are so safe why is it illegal? in the story it states "As a result in most states it is illegaleven to test computer-driven car." That dosent sound safe to me. It also states "manufatures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proven to be mor reliably safe." meaning that there not safe now.

Still think that computer driven cars are still safe? i didnt because of my three reasons. What if the car malfuntions or get hacked? Will they make new laws? If it is safe why is it illegal?
