I think the technology to read a student's emotional expression is not valuable. My reasoning for thinking it isn't is because it shouldn't be that serious to know one's emotions. The idea itself at first sounds cool if your trying to figure a painting's expression (like Mona Lisa) but, using it on a student to figure how the emotions they feel when they're doing something on the computer (math questions assigned by a teacher or a reading passage, etc.) is just unessassary and weird.

My evidence to support the claim of how this isn't really useful or nessassary is on paragraph 6 where it all explains how a computer should know when you sad or happy or confused/bored. It also explains how using the expressions the computer picks up it can determine whether the ad your seeing is boring you or confusing you and in my quiet honest opinion it is unessassary.

in conclusion, i think the technology to read a student's emotional expression is not valuable.
