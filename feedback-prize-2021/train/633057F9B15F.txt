Should drivers be able to use their cellphones while driving? A serious car crash could occur from using your cellphone while driving. You could harm another driver or yourself. If caught by an officer you'd have to pay a ticket.

Say you check the road and get the clear to check your phone for just one minute, but you just sort of glimpsed to see if there was any cars coming and you missed a stop sign. You hit a car in front of you and seriously injure the other driver. Checking your phone for just one second while driving can cause a life changing accident to happen, so it's better to stay off the phone while driving.

You can accidentally take your own life or someone else's life just because you couldn't keep your eyes off your phone. If you harm someone because you were texting and driving, they could sue you and take a lot of money away. You can even end up in jail if the other person's injury is serious. Imagine having to talk to the victim's family and explain to them that you hurt their beloved family member because you had to send that text message.

A less serious result of using your phone while driving is being caught by an officer and having to show up at court to pay a fine of minimum twenty dollars if it's your first time but texting and driving tickets can go as high as four hundred dollars. Also you may get your license suspended for minimum of six months. Why not just put the phone down?

Texting and driving has many negative outcomes; some more serious than others but we can avoid bringing harm to others and to ourselves by just staying off the phones until it is safe to or until our cars are on park. We can avoid having to pay a ticket and getting our license suspended. We can avoid taking someone's family member. It's better to just stay off the phones while we are driving a vehicle.
