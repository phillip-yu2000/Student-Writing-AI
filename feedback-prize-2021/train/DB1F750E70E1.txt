"Against Driverless Cars"

In the future we will need our own cars it's not neccesary to have that types of cars or traportations car like those kind. Everybody needs their own traportation to go to work,store,hospital,etc. For some reason it would be a good idea because it would save fuel because they will only used half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more far flexibility.

But,instead why don't they do they same cars now days people used and do it as the driveless cars it would be the same only thing that would be differnt is that everybody would have one it would be much easier and it wouldn't be public they would have to ride with other peopl or go all squish together because it's full.

Driverless Cars can be dangerous,How? well it couold cause accidents it can lose it's control anything can happen because their are that 100% reliable,plus google cars aren't truly driverless;they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of drivewaysor dealing with complicated traffic issues.

My opinion is no. I don't want for the future to have public cars like those.
