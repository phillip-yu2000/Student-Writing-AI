Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is or can be more resistant to pressure, and to heat, and to other forces. Venus also is a worthy pursuit because it has rocky sediments, and venus has valleys, it also has mountains, and craters. 97 percent blankets carbon dioxide. Venus also is a worthy pursuit because it is the closest planet in terms of density and size, and occasionaly the closest in distance too. Venus is a worthy pursuit because it orbits the sun at different speeds.

The dangers of venus is the clouds have a high corrosive sulfuric acid, the atmospheric pressure is very high, has the hottest surface temperature in our solar system, has erupting volcanoes. It also has powerul earthquakes and frequent lighting streaks to probes seeking to land on its surface. Another danger of venus is that radiation would not exceed earth levels.

I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because you can learn something about Venus you didn't know about, and you could learn new things you didn't know about venus. I also think studying Venus is a bad thing because it can lead to some dangers like getting to hot cause it has a very high atmospheric pressure. I also think it is a bad thing cause it has powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting streaks to probes.
