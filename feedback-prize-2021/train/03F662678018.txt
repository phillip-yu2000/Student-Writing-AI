Being a Seagoing Cowboys is a great job and you could become one too. This could be a great for you and im going to tell you a couple of reasons why I like my job and why you should join in with us.

I didnt really know much about this whole Seagoing Cowboys thing but I might as will give it a try i thought so I did and once I got into this it changed my whole live and this can be you too this can change your life too. If you love animals you will love this job as much as I do. They hired me to take care of animals like horses,young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea and this could also be you. You could take care of all these animals. I made nine trips the most of any seagoing cowboy and maybe If you joined the seagoing cowboys program You could beat my record and go up to 10 11 12 or higher. But the best thing about this is when you get to travel you get to go places you have never ever in your life dream of going. You get to go places like

Europe, China , Greece, and even Italy and have a good time . And you get to go on cattle boats for me they were unbelievable. But a good thing about this job was that you still get time for yourself and get to relax.

These were a few reasons why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure it opens the world to you. And you should join you will have a lot of fun in this program Its also will open the world to you.
