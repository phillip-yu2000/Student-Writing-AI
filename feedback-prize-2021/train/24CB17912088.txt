Dear Senator,

What do you think about the Electoral Collage? The electoral collage is a process,not a movement. The Electoral collage is unfair to the citizens of the united states. Its unfair to voters because they are not able to vote for a president of their like. Another reason the Electoral Collage is unfair is because citizens are not voting for their president they are voting for a slate of elector how will pick the president for them.

Citizins are givin the rights to vote. The electoral collage is a way of taking voting away from them. Why would someone want to vote if they are not going to be able to vote for a president of their like. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what they might call the disastor factor. The electoral collage is also unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning president candidate.

What is voting to a citizin? Isint voting a right for citizens to vote for their president of their choice? Why take it away from them with the electoral collage. If you look at it from an american citizen prospective its like they dont even have a word when choosing their president. What di Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on? they agreed on abolishing the electoral collage! According to a Gallup poll in 2000 over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct elections.

Thank you,

Anthony camel
