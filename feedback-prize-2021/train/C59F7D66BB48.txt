I think this kind of technology could be useful in a classroom. Most days, kids feel bored or tired just sitting in a class listening to a teacher talk. If we had this technology, kids could get more free time playing on the computer and when the computer notices boredom, then it could make the lesson more fun. If it can help kids learn, then it might be a good investment.

I am for the new technology. If computers could tell someones emotions, I would use it to explain my emotions. I could figure out what is wrong with my friends if they weren't acting normal. I think it is amazing.

To conclude, I think it would be cool to have this kind of technology. For computers to have technology like that, is mindblowing. We could use it to see how other feel about certain things. Like if you want to computer to learn fear, put someone that is scared of scary movies in a dark room and play scary movies until they get scared. Then have the computer scan them and see how it works. You could do this with any emotion. I like this technology. I think it is a good and practical investment.
