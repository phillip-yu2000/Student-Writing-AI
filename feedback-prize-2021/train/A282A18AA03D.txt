In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus the authur talks about how we should study Venus even though it is dangerous. He believes that even though expolring Venus can be dangerous that shouldnt stop us from trying to explore it anyway.

A claim that the author makes to support his idea that we should explore Venus is that " Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value". He believes that exploring Venus could be valuable to us on Earth. Some evidence I found in the text that supports hsi claim is that he says " not only because the insight gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. So hes basicly saying we might as well take on this challenge because our curiosity as humans will lead us to more challenges just like it.

So in conclusion that is my essay about the authros claim on exploring Venus even though it could be dangerous.
