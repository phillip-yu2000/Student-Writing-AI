When people are asking for advice,why are they asking more than one person? Well here's why they are doing it if you were to get in the middle of something and you had to pick from two things and you didn't know what choice to make you would ask some friends what they think would be a good choice to pick if it was one person they might not know which one would be a good choice to pick but with more people they can help you pick a good choice and they could give you different opinions on why it would be a good choice and it could also change your opinion on which one you choose because you could think about what choice you make and choose if it's what you was wanting to pick or not.

It's always a good thing to make good decisions and to take good advice, it's okay if you ask other people for advice because you can explain to them what's going on and they can help you understand that you should make a good choice instead of making a bad choice so nobody get's hurt or get's in trouble if you make a good choice it is the right thing to do so you don't get hurt or get in trouble and so the other person doesn't get hurt or in trouble and yall both are safe.

Helping people make a better choice than a bad choice is a good thing to do because you want to make sure they are safe and make sure they don't get in trouble showing people you care and that making a good choice can help you throughout life so you can have fun and be able to do what you love doing and being happy so instead of making a bad choice tell yourself no i'm gonna make the right choice and live my life and be happy.

Making a good choice is a better choice to pick so you can be happy and free and so you dont't hurt others or yourself always pick a good choice to make in life do what is right and not what is wrong you don't wanna pick a bad choice because it could really hurt you and affect your life and your future always make sure you pick a good choice and live your life happy and be able to do what you love and make sure your family is safe.
