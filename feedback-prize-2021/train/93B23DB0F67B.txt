Students taking classes from home is a advantage and disadvantage. Because most of the students don't pass the online class, its hard for students to understand, what the teacher is talking about when talking through a video call. But most of the parents cant afford to send their kids to school, so the kids gotta learn from home. Goin to school learn is the best way, so the teacher can explain them. The advantage is teachers stay after school for extra help for students. Most teachers come home, and teaches student. The parents can watch what their child is learning. So my paragragh is about disadvantage and advantage.

The students stay home and learn from their parents. If you live in a village in parts of Asia they have small school for students, they are free but their education isn't good. Parents don't have enough money to send their kids to school with good education. The small schools that are free doesn't offer that much education. Students just stay home and let parents teaches watever or how much they know. The schools that are free, the environment isnt good, the teachers arent that much educated.

The advantage is most of the teachers come home, and teaches students for free. Because they understand their parents cant afford. If students go to school and if they need extra help, teachers can stay after school. There are public schools in USA that offer free education. The students can learn a lot from school more than learning at home. In most part of the countries some good schools take a test what students know, if they pass the Government pays the expensive for the students. It is a very big advantage.

So taking classes online or going to school are both good. Beacuse education is very important, going to school is best way to get education. Because what the school teaches nobody can't.
