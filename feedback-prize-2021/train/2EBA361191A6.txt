I am against driverless cars because, it isn't really driverless if a driver is still required to drive at times. What if the driver falls asleep and the warning signals for them to begin driving doesn't wake them up? Then you have a wreck and then who is to blame? The owner or the manufacturer? Now, you have a huge arguement that would most likely have to go into court , and the buyer is most likely going to try to sue the manufacterur.

Another reason why i am against driverless cars is because, if the sensers mess up And don't sense a person walking across the street or a wreck ahead etc. and the driver isn't paying attention because they're on their phone or something and the warnings don't go off then you have an even bigger situation than the one that was already ahead. Then if the car gets messed up in anytype of way then the driver has to pay a lot more money to get things fixed then they would with a regular car, because that type of technology isn't cheap.

Another reason is , what if its snowing out side and the roads are icey , would the car be able to drive it's self through all the ice and stuff? It barely safe driving on ice with a regular car now. I believe that more wrecks would be caused by making driverless cars legal in all states .
