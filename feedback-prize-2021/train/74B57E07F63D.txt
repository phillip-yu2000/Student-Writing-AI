Dear Principal,

I think all student should perform in the community service because most of the students complaining about how the school is dusty and nasty looking, so for all that stuff they complaining about every student should help the community service to clean up the place and not the younger one alone, because a lot of people litter the place. so yes my opinion is that student should help out the community so it can be clean and not polluted because that way people wont after require about getting sick. so yeah i think helping out the community service is a very good idea.

when student use papers they don't throw the away , they can put the in the reycle bin and each week student will come around a collect them.

Other than throw garbage on the flow and around the community people can throw them in garbage bin because when you throw wasted tuff around the place. it just cause a lot of pollution and people get sick by that sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
