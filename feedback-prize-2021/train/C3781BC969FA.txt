Have you ever thought of driverless cars being a negative or postive thing to have? These cars would be a public transportation system. There are a lot of positive and negative things that these cars may offer. In my opionion driverless cars would be a negative thing to have.

When using a driverless car, the driver must remain fully aware. This is dangerous because a lot of people who drive a regular car, do not use their full attention. With that said if a person is on the phone and the car alerts them to take over, they may be to zoned out into a conversaion to notice it. This can cause the car to misfunction by the lack of control it is reciving. The misfunction of the car can lead to wrecks, injury of another person, or passing in zones that are blocked off.

In order for the car to prevent accidents, it must have sensors to tell the driver when they need to take over. These sensor could stop working at any given time. For example, we all like to use the internet on our phones and computers. When there is a terrific storm our conncection may not work. What happens if a wire breaks on an important sensor? Then an accident comes up and we do not get an alert. That can cause a very serious wreak.

If everyone is driving a driverless car, how can we ensure it is safe to trust them. We already have problems trusting the drivers around us today, due to them being irresponsible. What happens if something breaks on another persons car and causes them to wreck into someone else? This might not be the drivers fault. Car lights do not always work, so they may not be aware their car is going to wreck.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If there is a chance these alerts may not funtion correctly, how are we ensuring they are all safe? These negative outcomes and lack of information we have on these cars, are the reasons i believe this would have a negative outcome.
