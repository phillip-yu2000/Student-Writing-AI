There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Limiting car usage helps reduce smog in the cities. In the article, " Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog", the author, Robert Duffer, talks about France banned driving in order to clean the polluted air. According to the text, " Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals". Here it is evident that Paris has major pollution problems. Most of the vehicles in Paris have diesel fuel rather than gasoline, in which they favor due to a tax policy. "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party". This clearly shows us that the ban on driving in Paris had an advantage in keeping a clean air.

Not only will limiting car usage will maintain an polluted air for us to breathe, but it will decrease traffic jams. In the article, "Car-Free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota", by Andrew Selsky, a program is to "promote alternative transportation". Selsky writes, "Rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic". This tells the reader that this has positive impact on the city.

Limiting car usage could save time, improve safety, and conserve resources. According to the article, "The End Of Car Culture", the author mentions how her children live in places in which driving a car would be useful, however its not their priority because they "organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends". Although they could have gotten their own license to drive, it would have been a waste of money and time when there is always an avaliable and less cost transportaion.

Limiting car usages indeed does have advantages. The limiting of our car usages has positive effect on our enviroment by the reducing of smog, the decrease in traffic jams, conserves our resources and time, and also improves our safety.
