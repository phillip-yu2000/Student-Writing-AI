Cellphones Behind the Wheel

In the 20th century the cell phone is the most commonly used item. Everyone in most parts of the world have one. Cell phones paved the way for us to do so many things faster than ever before; it was a revolutionary item that has quite literally changed the world. People overusing it has become an issue to the point where it affects other things like driving.

People overuse phones because it's basically everything you do for entertainment packed up in a tiny little device. You can communicate with people, listen to music, watch tv, and a lot of other things. There is no question about why cellphones are this popular. Some would say they are too popular. Cellphones have been the cause to many vehicle accidents. People text and drive, or just do things on their phone while behind the wheel and next thing you know, their car is in a ditch.

There have been laws passed in some states that outlaw the use of cell phones while driving. While I don't completely agree with the full banning of phones while driving, I do understand why they did it. Being on your phone while driving is a huge safety risk to you, anyone in your vehicle, and also anyone on the road with you. It isn't fair for others to be at risk because one individual can't wait to respond to a text or check a notification.

I think there should be some kind of phone lock that is incorporated into each device which basically only gives limited access while moving in vehicles. It could be similar to "do not disturb" but also only allows calls to come through and has like a one-touch system or system that uses your voice so you won't have to look off the road.

As dangerous as cellphones can be they are also useful and we need them. There needs to be more of a sure proof method of stopping people from using their phones for the wrong reasons while driving.
