To me I like the idea of having driverless cars, because if someone goes on a long vacation and they did not want to fly they would have to drive. When you are driving for a long period of time your legs will eventually get tired and you will have to stop at rest station. With the driverless cars they will drive themselves and you can just sit back and relax while of course still paying attention to the road ahead of you. This will get you to your destination in less time because you will make less stops.

In the article is states, "In 2013, BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant. The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." This is a good thing for these types of cars because you do not want your car to just go straight through a construction zone and not be able to stop it. Or you do not want your car to go the wrong way if there is a detour. I like the idea on how if the driver needed to he can take over the wheel and get going the correct way.

I agree that these cars could be a good thing for us in the future because of the things that I have said above. These cars may not have sounded like a good thing in the beginning but as of right now they are an up and coming thing for us. Even if you like to drive this does not mean you have to get one of these types of cars. It is just a good idea for people whose legs can get tires really quick or if you are going on a long car trip. This car is the way to go.
