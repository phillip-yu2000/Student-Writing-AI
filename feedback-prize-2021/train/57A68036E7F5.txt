Asking people for advice can be hard work. So hard, in fact, that you are tempted to ask only one person. However, this may not be the best option. The most optimal technique for gaining advice is to ask as many people as possible, and to follow the advice that you feel is best. Here is some advice on how to ask for advice:

When seeking advice, turn to who you feel are your most credible sources. Teachers, parents, and trusted adults can all lend you helpful tidbits of information. People usually give advice to you as if they were giving it to their past selves, so advice tends to be full of bias. There are also a lot of many-sided ethical dilemmas that have completely different answers depending on who you ask.

Always follow the advice that makes the most sense to you. When people are throwing their opinions out there, they will usually tell you what works best for them. For example,Â when asking for advice about how to study, not every tip is going to apply to you, because everyone has different learning styles. You might want to ask many people and only use the advice that you like most, or that you feel would work for you.

If you are too shy about asking for advice, you may be tempted to look on the internet. Do not look on the internet first. Always ask your parents or other trusted adults before embarking on the quest to find advice on the internet. You may find articles written by random strangers who are writing for a much older audience with different needs or wants than you. Since they are writing mostly for everybody, they will not consider everybody's needs, and will speak for the default demographic.

Remember to always ask more than one person for advice, and to follow the advice that you feel would help you the most. Ask parents and trusted adults before consulting anyone else, and especially before consulting the internet. Armed with this new toolkit of knowledge, you are now ready to ask for advice the right way!
