I would say that driverless cars could be dangerous in many cases.

There could be an accident if there was a driver just going across the road and the driverless car malfunctioned.

The driverless car could crash straight into the driver no matter how people see it.

The article stated that driverless cars can't see the road themselves but they can sense when something is coming near it.

Even if a driverless car sensed something near it; if the car was going at any type of speed like 25 mph it would probably hit somebody that it might not have sensed.

Anything bad could happen with these new generation of cars, sticking to how regular things are is better than taking a risk of someone getting hurt.

The moral of my essay is to tell people that even if people say there is no harm done by making these cars, the truth is anything could happen and it could malfunction anytime.

My answer would be no to having driverless cars even if they made it a bit safer that doesn't mean it wouldn't accidentally crash into someone.

Driverless cars would work better as a gps not as a car that could move on it's own.
