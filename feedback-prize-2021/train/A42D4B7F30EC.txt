Dear Principle,

To me community service is very important. It helps others who are in need. If you want to assign people to do community service go right ahead. But most people don't want to because they think it's a waste of there time.

So you can solve this one way, you can show these students how great charity is!

For example helping clean up litter is a great way to prevent pollution. And reading to young children helps there education. Talking to elders gives them hope, and helping the homeless keeps them alive.

If you can show these student that its not a waste of time then maybe they will help. My advice is to prove to them that community service is a great thing. If people can take up about two hours of there lives for charity, then the world would be a better place to live in. And not just our school should do this i think everyone should.

But you cant force people to do community service if they don't want to because most likely they wont show up. And then they will get an F on that assignment, and they will fail!.. And nobody wants that.

if they don't want to do a great thing for the planet, or for young children or even family's or elders then that's there problem, they can just do extra credit. But i still think you should show them how it will help the world. Ex; Have an assembly to talk about community service!..

If you do decide that you want to assignee the task of community service, then i would like the position of helping homeless people. i think they need more help than anybody. But that's just my opinion. I would like to donate food and clothing to a fund who does help homeless people.

i think that this assignment is a wonderful idea!

Thank you... sincerely your student .. STUDENT_NAME:)
