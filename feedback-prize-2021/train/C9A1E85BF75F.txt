When I need advice, I don't just ask one person I askÂ multiple people. When someone asks multiple people they usually make a better choice. People usually make a better choice when they seek multiple opinions because it gives them more ideas for what they should do, and if multiple people say the same opinion, then it usually means it's good advice. These are some reasons why you ask more than one person.

The first reason is because it would give the person more ideas on what they should do. If you can't think of what to do, why not just ask a few of your friends what they would do, then you could get an idea of what you should do. Say that you dropped your phone and it broke, and your mom is going to get very mad at you if she finds out, and you have no idea what to do. You could just call a couple of your friends ask them what they would do, then you would have a whole bunch of ideas to go off of. Since you asked multiple friends, a couple of them might've given the same advice. That is also a reason why it helps someone make a better choice. If you go to a restaurant and everyone is saying that their steak is the best in town, then it has to be good right? So if you ask six of your friends for advice, and four of them say the same thing, then it has to be good advice.

Those are all of the reasons why multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. These are just a couple of the reasons why but not all of them. There are a lot more reasons. So remember, next time when you need advice, don't just ask one person, ask multiple people.
