Dear principal,

I think you should use policy number 2 for our school because phones at school would be distracting to kids and they wont be learning what the teachers are teaching them. If you let kids bring their phones to school they wont pay any attention to school work. It could do damage to our school district. they wouldn't be getting the education they need. most kids who don't participate in school work end up with out a good career. School is a place to learn and there should be no electronics at school at all. I think most parents would agree with policy number 2 also. Thins could also get broken or stolen.

If you think about it most schools policy are no phones in school and their students are probably doing better than they would be if they could have there phones at school. Most kids wont agree to this policy but its actually better for them. They need to concentrate on school. I think its ok that they have them at school when they are being rewarded for something. Kids are easily distracted in school because they are usually bored. Please pick policy number 2.
