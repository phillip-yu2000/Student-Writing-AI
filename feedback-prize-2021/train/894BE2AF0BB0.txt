Hi, Im luke, If you are sitting around looking for adventure, stop by the seagoing cowboys program and find your adventure. We can help lots of people and so can you! We can take care of horses, cattle, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Once you get your seaman's papers then you can aboard a boat as you travel across the 7 seas, with cargo full of all sorts of different animals like horses, cattle, and mules. It takes about 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic and the sheep have to be fed 2 or 3 times a day but you will get used to it.

You can also have lots of fun once you get on the boat. there are games you can do to pass time, The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

There is a lot of sight seeing on the boat too, you get to see China, Europe, Acropolis, Greece, Italy, and lots of other great places around the globe. You can take a granola ride in Venice, Italy of maybe even tour a castle in Crete, and marvel at the Panama Canal. Like i did There are lots of fun things you can do at the Seagoing Cowboys!

So if you you like to have adventures, sight seeing, or even play a lot of fun games, come on down and sign up for this wonderful journey. We can take all the people we can can get!

So sign up at 4354 Seadog Lane, Florida. I think you will enjoy it, I know I did.
