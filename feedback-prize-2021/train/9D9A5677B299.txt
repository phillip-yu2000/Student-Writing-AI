In paragraph 6 it mentions why FACS is a good and helpful tool to use inside a classroom. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Adanced Science at the Unversity of Illinois, ¨A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,¨ Dr. Haung also goes on and predicts ¨Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.¨ By Dr. Haung telling us this information it shows us that by using FACS our students may pay better attention in class becuase they are not confused nor bored.
