In the aticle "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author talkes about how this new technology made can detect the emotions a human face is making. The technology can also detect famous faces painted like the mona lisa to detect if she was actually smiling or not. The technology seems great and all but would it be usefull in classroom enviornment?

The technology is still new and being devoloped more and more. The inventors that created it think it would be useful in the classroom to tell when a kid is confused or bored. I for one wouldnt want a camera watching me all class to tell if I am bored or confused. I would rather go and ask a teacher a question if I was confused, instead of being asked if I was confused since the technology might not detect facial features correctly.

In the sventh paragraph the author states, " Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.", If a regular PC at home wouldnt not be able to hand this software how would a school be able to afford such high tech software for all of its classrooms. The school could in turn spend money on things that matter more instead of trying to detect facial expressions of students.

In conclusion, I think this software has its ways to go to become ready to come into schools, once in becomes less expenisve and it can run on regular school computer. I find this technology intruiging but I do not find it right for a school enviornment. I do however find it interesting to use to find out when people are lying or use it to detect facial features of people that are maybe in trouble but can't say it in a kidnapping type of situation.
