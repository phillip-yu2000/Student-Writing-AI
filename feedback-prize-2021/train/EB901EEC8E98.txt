Dear Senator,

Its official, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, ans irrational.  A direct election would make it fair to most states and it wouldnt matter on the amount of electors.

The electoral college depends on the popular vote so the you are only voting for the electors not the actual canidates if you think about it.  Each states gets a certain amount of electors depending on the population of that state.  For example,

California gets 55 electors while Florida only gets 29.  So the presidents wont eben care to show up to places Alabama with only 9 electors.  They would only go to the bigger populated states and try and win their votes and not worry about the rest of the country.

If we had a direct election more of the people vote would count and it wouldnt matter about the electors in the states.  The citizens would actually be voting on the canidates.  This is a much more fair system to include everyone into and have an accurate election.

In the end, you should realize how uneccessary the electoral college is and how the direct election is a more fair way to get accurate results.  This way we would have much less issues and the elections would take place in all states and not just the ones with more electors.
