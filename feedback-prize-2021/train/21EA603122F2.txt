Driveless cars is not a smart idea. Its a posiablity that the so called "Smart Car" could malfuncition while someone is in it and cause a crash or even death to the passangers.

Yes, its true that there are cars now that can break one their own, warn the driver if something is in close contact and more. How ever, the entire time there is a driver in control at ALL TIMES. There is not a moment where the car alone is moving. Another reason driveless cars is not a wise desision is that its illegal to even test drive one in many places. For exsample; Califorina, Nevada Florida, and the District of Colimbia. Alose, law makers know that saftey is best achived with alert drivers.

Smart cars are not so smart. They in danger lives with un-foced drivers, and are not even ligel everywhere. Humans are not ready for such an advanced way of transpertation quite yet. Possiably in the future, but as of right now that would be a no to smart car techonolgy.
