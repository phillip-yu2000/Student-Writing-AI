The first to paragarphs say that venus is some time the closes planet to the earth and is more like earth then we think. We have try to land numerous unmanned spacecraft to venus both non have survived the landing for more then an a few hours do to the extreme atomsphere.

The auther said that we could benfit by overcoming the high tempertures and amaking a stronger matrial that can with stand the sulfuric acid atmosphere. Another way we could benfit form is by making stong submarine so we would be able to dive deeper into the deepest parts of the oceans on earth.

The auther said that NASA idea of flying over venus is one way we could overcome the hard surface conditions that venus. That we would never run out of energy because venus is the second close planet to the sun. The temp is at around 170 degrees fahrenheit and that radiation levels are low so it is survivable for humans.

In conlusion to my essay about "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" I can that striving to meet challenges preseented by venus has value and the insight that we would gain on the planet and what we can then use to improve life on earth is priceless.
