Have you ever someone's opinions, but didn't know who to ask? Instead of asking one person you can ask multiple people. You would be better off asking multiple people because, you can get more than one view and opinion on things, you gain more experience

,

and you can come up with new ideas.

Have you ever heard people arguing about who's right and who's wrong? Let's they are both right they just have different opinions

. You take both of their opinions into account. The more opinions you have the better choices you will make. Use your reasources and make better chioces.

The more experiance you have the more you can tell people. As you get older you gain more life experiances

, so you will have more opinions. People will come to you for opinions and they will keep coming back for more.

Have you ever come up with a new idea

? The more opinions you have the better ideas you come up with. The scientist Thomas Eddison didn't just com eup with the light bulb he had other opinions. There is quote that says,"the more opinions you have the better the ideas".

Ask multiple peole for their opinions because you can come up with new ideas, gain more life experiances, and get different opinions.
