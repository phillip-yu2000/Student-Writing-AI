Dear, Principal

I know you have a hard chose at hand and here is maybe some thing to make that chose better. Out of the two policy's I think that policy number one is the one you should chose. Because you would give the students a little bit more freedom to there own lives. And also there are some time situation where students many need to talk to someone or they need to make plans to do something important. Such as one of the rare a cations such as a death of a family member or a close friend. But also it might be some thing different and happens often such as they forgot a project or assignment at home and they need some to pick it up or e-mail it to them so they can get it in on time. Or it could be some is lost or trapped some where in need to call for help of a friend or in series case the police or fire department. Even this thoughts seem very far fetched they can is still possible they can become true.

This will also show that when students are give this responsible they will take it and will show you what they can do. People will surprise you when you are not excepting it. Thank you for your time and I hope I made this chose a little bit easier for you.
