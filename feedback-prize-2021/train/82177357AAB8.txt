Dear: Principal

Well this change that your doing is not cool because the kids would just have to work on studying and not a little bit of fun during school hours. If i was you i would let the kids be in sports having and representing my school but as long as they have a c average. I think your not letting us have fun and representing your school because maybe you didn't have the chance to play or be in a sport when you were little. See we probably try our hardest but we just don't understand the class and kids also need to be having something to do besides work and more work us kids will get tired of working so much that probably going to drop out, we kids need to be working out or have something in our minds besides work and work.

Kids our age do need to learn but we also need to have fun too you know, to much work will make us forget some stuff that we already know, so it will be nice if we just had some time to relax, and not think about school or homework. So hope you change your mind about us having a b average just so we can play any sport it will be nice if you did.
