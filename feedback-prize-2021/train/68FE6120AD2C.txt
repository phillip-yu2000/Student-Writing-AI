Is the Face just a natural landform? Yes, the Face on Mars is just a gigantic rock formed by shawdows. In paragraph 5, it say it's a rock that resembled a head. It shows an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth making it look like something it actually is not. NASA has all the evidence to prove that their isn't a face on the planet Mars, but just a regular landform.

Some people were unsatisfied and some was with the conclusion NASA came up with involving the Face on Mars. Others thought perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze. In paragraph 9, Garvin stated, " it's not that easy to target Cydonia." He also said, "In fact, it's hard work." People were so ungrateful with the answers that were given to them, so NASA had to go through too much trouble to hit them with more evidence again.

In Conclusion, I would like to say that Nasa was 100 percent right when they said it was only a landform. There was three pictures taken from years 1976-2001. With the years 1976 and 1998, people absolutely believed that their was a face on our planet Mars, but by 2001, more people was convinced there was no face on Mars, but a landform like NASA have been telling them. In paragraph 7, its says there was no alien monument after all. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. A butte/mesa is landforms common around the American West. As much as people may think Mars have a face on it, we all know that it does not. the question everyone wanted to know is, Is the Face just a natural landform? It took citizens 25 years to finally say yes to the question. Even though Unmasking the Face on Mars was very disappointing, people eventually got over it.
