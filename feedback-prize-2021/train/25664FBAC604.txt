Imagine you are woke up and you are running late for work, now in my case if I was running late to work I would hop in my car and get going as fast as I could to try and get to work on time. But if you have a Driverless Car does that mean that the car would only go the speed limit so you could not hurry up to get to work? If you got rearended by a car car drivng on the highway and started spinning out of control would the Drtiverless Car let you take control of the wheel to try and save yourself? These are both valid questions to ask before you take a step into the furture with Driverless Cars.

Many people will argue that Driverless Cars would be very helpful the todays busy and nonstop world, but if the elements were out of your control would you feel safe with your life in the hands of a car? I believe that the best way to be safe on the road would be to have a driver in control of the vehicle. Human error will always be a factor in driving but trusting that humans have been trained and have some experience behind the wheel will always over power the risk of taking the chance of a machine keeping families safe while drivng.

The manufacturers of the Driverless Cars would also have a heavy weight on their shoulders becuase if the Drivreless Cars gets into an accident who's fault is it? There would have to be careful expamination of the product and what happened during the crash. If the crash were to be the manufaturers fault then the company that the car was produced at could be sued millions of dollars due to many crashes.

In conclusion the Driverless Car to me would be a poor decsion for people to buy becuase there are many unknown factors tht deal with this product. the Driverless car has not proven yet that it is safe enough to be out on the roads and to keep people safe.
