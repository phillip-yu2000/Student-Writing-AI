I think Policy number 1 is better because you need to have your phone in case of emergency. Another example is that you should turn it off in classes but on your free time you can have it on.

You need to bring your phone to school in case of emergency. Because what if your parent or someone your close to got hurt and your mom or dad is trying to reach you in school and you don't have your phone with you. Another reason is say if your stuck in school and you need your parent to pick you up from school, and if you don't have your phone and your parents are looking for you. They might think you got lost or kidnapped or you just ran away from home.

You should bring your phone to school but you should have it turned off in class.

Because if you take a test it should be off and if you have it on and your teacher finds it on they can say you are cheating on a test. Another example is when it is free time you can have it out because it is free time you should be able to do what you want on your free time.

Policy number 1 is better for a lot of reason but policy, but policy number 2 is not a good idea for you not to bring your cell phone to school.
