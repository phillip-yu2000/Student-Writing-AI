Have you ever wondered what another person was thinking or feeling? With the help of the technology called the Facial Action Coding System, you can identify human emotions! There are several reasons why this system is valuable.

One way the F.A.C.S is valuable to a classroom is you can do more things in science contributed to emotions and human qualities. Even if you tried to fake your emotions in the classroom you couldn't. When you first start the process of detecting your emotions, it has to make a 3-D model of your face, and make sure all the mucles move like human muscles. According to the text, "Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness." These special skills can not only help you read people, but also F.A.C.S. teaches you about a whole new life to underatnd people, and they way they feel. Mnay different people will take this system and use it in so many different ways, and try so many new things with it. I personally think that this will be very valuable to normal people like us and, everyday scientists, and especially throughout the school coprorations.

This system is very valuable to the school system, because it doesn't just let you try new things but it can also keep you up to date on how people are doing and feeling. Imagine what kind of experiments you could do with a system like this!
