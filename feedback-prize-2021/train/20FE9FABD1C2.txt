When you first hear of this new software you may not see a need for such technology to exist. However, once you take a look into what this exciting software is capable of, you might actually grow into the idea. I believe that this software could just end up being a helpful resource used in everyday life.

If executed in the correct manners, I believe that this software could be an incredible resource that serves many different purposes. Not too long ago, technology became an everyday tool in schools around the globe. If new software such as this was implemented into devices we used at school, as a student I believe that I would benefit from it greatly. The author used the example predicted by Dr. Thomas Huang of a student who is getting bored or confused. The device could potentially produce a pop-up providing help or motivation and encouragement.

This software could be put introduced to many ways of life. For example, self-checkout stations and bank ATM's. If you appear to need help you will provided with assistance. It could potentially be a major improvement for costomer service. Software like this would definitely take getting used to, but would be worth it in the end if we are optimistic enough.

Another possibility would be for this software to be used while using serach engines. If you appear to not be satisfied, you will be directed to a page of new results. Perhaps if you show interested in certain results but not others, you could get a page of new result compiled of just the results you seemed interested in. Similar to the example of web ads appearing on your screen given to us by the author.

I believe that this software could end up being a very important feature in technology. This technology may not be very extensive yet. However, it definitely has potential. It could be implemented into many regions of everyday life. I think that the possibilities are endless.
