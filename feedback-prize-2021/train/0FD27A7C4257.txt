If the principal of my school decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would be happy. I would be happy because there are many benefits to doing an extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities can make you better at different things and they are often fun. They also give you a break from the regular school day to do something you enjoy. I totally agree with my principal's decision.

If you chose to do a sport it would be good for your body. You would get your daily exercise in while doing something fun. Doing a sport would also make you a better communaciater. If you do a sport you have to work with your team. They have to understand what you need and you have to understand what they need. To do that you have to talk to each other.

There are many extracurricular activities to choose from. If you don't yet know what you enjoy, this would be a perfect opportunity to explore new activities. You could try new things and see what you like. This would also make it easier to choose a future career. If you know what you enjoy then you can narrow down your job choices.

Extracurricular activities give kids a break from the regular school day to do something they enjoy. This hour of "fun time" might give some kids a reason to like school. You would look forward to this class because you enjoy it.

These activities can also build relationships. You could make new friends in your extracurricular class because you all like the same thing.

In conclusion I think it is a great idea to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities expand your horizons and make you better at the things you like. They are fun and encourage students to try new things. You can explore the plethora of activities and find one you like. Lastly, I think that these activities show students that academics is not everything and that they should do things they enjoy.
