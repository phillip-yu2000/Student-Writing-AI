The principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, and I am hare to tell you why this is a stupid idea. Depending on the sichwashin sum people mite not have time to do such things because of financing problems, or their medical problems. Sum famles do not have a lot of money to support their kids so the kids have to git a job, so they can provide them self's with their nasisary needs. If the school forsis the students to take a extracurricular activity than the students will loss money because their giting lass time to work at their job's. Their famles mite need financial support for resins like their low on cash, their in date, or they need medical support. The students mite need medical support, for a disability, a sickens, or cancer. Such cudichins can make it hard for the student to perform the extracurricular activity. In cncloshin this role shod be lifted because performing, and taking part of the extracurricular activity will be hard.
