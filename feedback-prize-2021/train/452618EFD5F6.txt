In my opinion, we dont need cars that drive on there own. A big reason is because people today are already not very smart, and a car that helps them drive will not make things better. they wont learn to do things on there own, and wont beable to teach younger people, they'll just have a car that drives for them.

If you drive you do it because you like to, or at least when you first started,

it's fun to drive. But theres no point if the car drives by it's self. Plus taxes will go up tromendously, vehicles will cost more. By time 2020 comes they'll be so many people rideing bikes to work and home, because they don't make enough money to by a car that was replaced with a self driving vehicle.

Also we shouldn't give a reason for people to be able to text and drive, as long as they get warned when the car needs the person to take over. A big problem with that is because if the needs the person to take over and the person is in the middle of a text, they'll want to finish that text, or at least see if they can before it's to late, before get to the wheel and driveing.
