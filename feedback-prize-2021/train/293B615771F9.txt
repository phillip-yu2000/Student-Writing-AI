Dear , I disagree with you On trying to Make All student's perform community Service because Most of the time the only reason why people have community service is for getting in trouble with the law ,Truancy! And Just to give Community service For no reason makes No sense To me.

Community Service is Something that I would Dislike A lot Because you have to do dirty work,

cleaning Toliets, Painting walls, Cleaning Ditches. Basically You have to clean up somebody else's Mess which I would Not like to do At All. Would you Like To do Community Service? Because I think it sounds Like No Fun At All it sounds like a waste Of time when you could be doing Something Better Like Cleaning your Own House, Cooking for your Family, Cleaning your own Room, Spending Quality Time with your family.

I have My own opinion but Wouldn't you rather be at home with your Family then to be at Unknown places cleaning When you don't even know who's Been there or Why is it so dirty? Maybe Community Service is good for bad Kids So they Can Learn Why Getting in trouble And missing School is Not Worth it.
