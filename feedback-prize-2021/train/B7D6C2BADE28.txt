I disagree with the Driverless car. Any one could get hurt,and any thing could happen. The Driverless car s unnecessary and many ways. I will be telling you why I disagree with it and why it unnecessary.

The Driverless car is unnecessary because it will make people more lazy,and not want to do things. Doing that is not healthy,and it could turn and to bad habits. Having the Driverless car can make you lazy and being lazy can cause many health issues. It is not a good idea.

Also having the Driveless car is also can be a dangerous thing. Because it is technolgy something bad can happen any time. It could shut down in the middle of no where. Like for an example say the car stop working right in the middle of traffic. That is very dangerous for the driver,the person that is driving,and the person that is crossing the street. That is another reason why it's not a good idea.

In conclusion The Driveless car is not a good idea. It can be dangerous at many points. The article say "Presently,traffic laws are written with the assumption that only safe car has human driver control at all times." It can make you lazy. It also can be dangerous because technolgy is not alway reliable. That is why it's not a good idea.
