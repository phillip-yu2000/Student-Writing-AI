To begin with, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have found that the planet Venus is the most Earth like planet. Venus and Mars are the closest planets to Earth .

Venus is almost the same size as earth and has the almost the same density to. Theirfore scientist suggest that studying Venus is a worthy persuite despite the dangers it haves. It can give good result to NASA becuase if it is earth like they can see what is the problem to try and land. More studying is suggested because it can be anothe rplace were people can live and have alot of naturall resources a like a restart of the earth.

To continue with, It is alot analogous to earth that it has erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, valleys, craters, mountains, etc. It would be worth taking samples, searching, to get to know Venus better and maybe some day have a life over their.
