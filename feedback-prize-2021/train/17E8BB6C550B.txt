Driverless cars do seem like the thing today's society is pushing for in the future, but is it as good as they say it is? How would one operate such a car? How much could it cost? These are questions that have all been asked before.

"Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues." Now why pay for a car that can't fully operate itself through such tribulations? If I get a "driverless car" I want to be able to go to sleep and wake up parked at my destination.

Driverless cars do seem good in a sense of not being able to drunk drive, unless you put too much gas in the tank. If you know what I mean. On the note of gas, would a driverless car be running on gas or electric? Or both since it would have such high energy usage with all of the cameras. Which would spike up the price dramatically if it was electric and you'd constantly have to charge it.

In my opinion driverless cars are something that do sound fun, but at the same time dangerous. There are certain things that your car wouldn't be able to see that the human eye could. For example, what if somebody's turn signals were out so they had to use their hand. How would the car see that and know to slow down? With that question on the table who would be responsible for that crash?

So in a sense driverless cars are very cool, but seem to be more of a hastle than it's worth. I'd rather just keep both hands on the wheel and move on with life. It's also just lazy, what's the point in having a drivers license if I'm not driving the car?
