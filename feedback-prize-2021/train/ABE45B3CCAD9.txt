Dear Principal,

I am very concerned about the new school policy that is students may not participate in sports or other activities if you do not have at least a B average . I don't think that should be a school policy because there are kids that try there best

100% and they don't get B averages but they really want to play sports. I think that it should be that if you are a hard working student and you want to be able to participate in sports or other school activities , you should be able to . and for the kids that don't try there 100% best on their work they should be the students that are not able to participate in the school sports and activities. also the students that are not getting good grades but are trying 100% , they might not feel well they might be sad and so if they participate in sports or school activities that will bring joy into them and they can have fun instead of constantly thinking about how bad you are doing in school. and you will have the chance to have fun and get exercise. the kids would be able to get exercise and they will be in better shape and will be a healthy person.

Sincerely,

Student
