When people ask for advice they automatically just trust the opinion of others but also ask many others for their opinions and here is why...

People will trust an indavujal but not trust their opinion, Because the little part of you disagrees and that is natural you are two totally different people. You will go to others to weigh out their opinion and see which one is better you could get two opinions one person is foolish lets say you just asked them first. The other person is wise will you follow the first opinion or go seek out another. Which will be a wise opinion from a wise person or a opinion from a foolish person. However everyone wants a wise persons advice but what if that foolish person. Has a wiser moment in that opinion than the wise one, you will never know when one is truly wise unless. You take the time to see for yourself The foolish one may be the wiser one does not matter their intelligence the only thing that. Really matters is their opinion and the reason behind it so seek out both opinions and truly see which opinion fits the description of what your looking for in an answer. For example, if you only take one opinion than you wont have anything weigh out in the end. You dont only have to seek out only two you can do as many as you like just write them own and see which was is the best way to go.
