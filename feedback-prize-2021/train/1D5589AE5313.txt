Dear, State Senator

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral college. i am in favor of keeping Electoral college because it was the original decision made by our founding fathers. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to select the president. under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the elctoral college. for this reason, in the following discussion, the word "state" also refers to  the District of columbia..

most states have a "winner-takes-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidates.

but people  like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO think that we should abolish the electoral college.

although i am in favor of it, there are some disadvantages to electoral college. under the electoral college system, voters vote for a a slate of electors who in turn elect the president.

the american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worst.
