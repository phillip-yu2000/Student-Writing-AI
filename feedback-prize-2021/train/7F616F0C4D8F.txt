Many students when they get to high school might not get the chance to participate in a sport because they might think that they have to get a B to get into a sport or team that's top of the list so they end up stressing them selves just to try to get into a sport or team and even thou they get there they cant seam to stay there so then they give up an grow husky, now activity's, in some jobs or careers they don't have training so then when the get to there career or job they don't know what to do or even how to do it so then they get fired and can't support there family and then they get the worst job in the city that doesn't pay well or just that they become homeless so there is the reason why you should not change the school policy to get in a sport or activity you must need a B.
