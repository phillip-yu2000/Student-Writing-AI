This article was stating that Venus is Earth's "twin." It is the closest in distance as well. Venus has many things wrong with it before anyone could ever live on it. Venus could be our nearest option for planitary visit. There is Earth like qualities but, it is very dangerious. Scientist still study this world because they know that if they could have a landing that was successful then they could finaly really start to explore the suface.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth. At times we may be closer to Mars do to the speed at wich the planets spin but we are usually closest to Venus. Many spacecraft have been sent to Venus trying to learn more of it but each time that it has been attempted, it has only been able to last a few hours before failing. Venus is a challenging planet to be studied.

Venus has many issues but there is profe that there may have once, long ago, been covered with oceans and had plenty of adaptable life on it. Today there are still some places on Venus that have Earth like features. Land forms that look the way Earth's do. There are valleys, moutains, and craders.

Though it is true that Venus is closest to us and may be the best otpion for visitation one day in the future it still has many problems. The planets surface area is an avaerage of 800 degrees Farenhheit. The atomic pressure is 90 times as much as Earth. At this point in time Venus is enhabital. There must be more reasearch allowed on Venus to find out if anyone could ever step foot on it.

Venus must be researched more to learn as much as possable if it is said that it is the most livable planet. It has many dangers, yes, but that is the vary reason it needs more attention. The more time spent on reasearching Venus the more likley that we will be able to maybe reverse the effect to make it look as it did those any a years ago when it had bodies of water and valleys.
