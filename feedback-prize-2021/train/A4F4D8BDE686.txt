"The Seagoing Cowboys program is an adventure," stated Luke. We go all over the place, for example we have been to China and Greece. The Seagoing Cowboys program made me more aware of people's needs in other countries. When we had nothing to do we would waste time by playing games in empty holds where animals had been housed.

When I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program we helped baby cows, mules, and horses that were shipped overseas. We arrived August 14 when the Pacific war ended. Don and I headed for Greece with horses and hay and oats to feed them.

You should be apart of the program because it is fun to go on adventures and take care of the animals. Even if you don't like animals you get to have freetime and play games and visit places like China. When you unload the animals you can play tennis, boxing, reading, and whittiling. The program opened up the world for me.

When I took care of the animals they had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Also you had to pull up bales of hay and bags of oats. Next then you had to clean the stalls out. When I worked at a farm for my aunt Katie, it prepared me for the Seagoing Cowboys program. I was greatful for the opportuniy to help the program.

You should join the program because you help people by bring the animals and you have fun at the same time. I want to go back and join the program because it was the best thing ever and it opened up the world to me by exploring and seeing other countries. When I saw the family's in need my family hosted a number of exchanged students for many years.
