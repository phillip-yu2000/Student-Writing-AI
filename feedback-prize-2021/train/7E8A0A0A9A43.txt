If you dont get advice or info from different sources you wont see the whole picture.

getting information from multiple outlets is important because everyone sees different things happening. In the news people tend to stick to one station of viewpoint, but this isn't always the best because it is usually going through multiple people to make it sound better or worse, for example; you may see a headline that says "

Donald Trump wastes tax money to ruthlessly crush immigrants dreams

" and you may see another headline from the same event reading "

Donald Trumps wall was triumphant in protecting America from foreign criminals

". the reason these sound so different is because they are coming from different points of view, the first one probably got its information from an immigrant, the second probably got its information from someone who likes the wall. Both of these are true and if you get facts from both of them together you can get a better understanding on what really happened.

Now, lets get back to when people ask for advice, because asking for advice and reading news are too completely different things, however you can use a lot of the same techniques. However its often a lot harder with advice because you dont have sources and they aren't always both about the same event, instead they are straight up the persons opinion. You also can't merge advice as easily as you can with news for example: you are asking your friends if you should cheat on the math test, the first friend says "no, thats dishonest" and the other friend says "do it or you might have to take summer school" dont just merge them and half cheat on the test, instead you should weigh in the positives and negatives. weighing the pros and cons works great for getting advice and once you do this you can make an educated decision.
