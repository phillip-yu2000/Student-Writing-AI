Many people give up their lives and time to become a seagoing cowboy. Luke was one of those people who did this. Many people who join this program wanted to help people by not joing the military so they joined this program. These people helped countries with problems after wars. There are lots of reasosns to join the UNRRA program.

Another reason to join the seagoing cowboys is you get to help people while traveling. You get to see so many things that you probably wouldn't have seen if you were not a seagoing cowboy or memeber on UNRRA. Many people did this after World War II ended in Europe. The text states "It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins." and

"In August 1945, they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans. 'We arrived August 14,' Luke says, 'the day the Pacific war ended.'"

Luke and his friend had to go over seas the day a war on the water ended.

Sure there are dangers of being a seagoing cowboy, but many countries and people are helped. People join not just for travel, but to help others. Many countries are helped do to the UNRRA program. Many countries get food, shelter, and clothes taken away to help military during war. The UNRRA helps these people get these things back. The text states "'It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.'" and "UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)."
