The idea of driverless cars is exremely crazy, and doesn't make any sense. Creating a 100% hands free car is just another way to make America more lazy than we already are. Completely driverless cars are too big of a leap considering all the accidents that still occur with the drivers hand are on the wheel, and manufacturers still want to create a car that mimics the skill of a human? What if a malfunction occurs while the car is in motion? What if someone gets injured? These things must be considered if safety is a big concern.

The most important thing when driving is keeping your eyes on the road at all times. However, manufacturers are planning on inserting in-car entertainment which is more than likely going to result in the drivers taking their eyes of the road. What about the flashing lights on the windshield? That sounds like a great idea! No seriously, how dangerous is that? If they're too into the in-car entertainment they may not even see the flashing lights. Or the worst case senario the driver could be sleep, bored from having to wait their turn to drive or just sitting there in general. Safety is the most important, not making driving easier.
