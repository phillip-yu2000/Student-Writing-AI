This essay is going to talk about the "Facial Action Coding System." This article is called " Making Mona Lisa Smile." And is written by Nick D'Alto. The (FACS) would be good in classrooms.

This coding could be good for students and teachers. So lets say we do get this in classrooms, then the robot could tell if someone is having a bad day, or needs more help on something, just by reading their faces. Then the teacher would maybe help the student more or ask whats wrong, and get the student some kinda help.

If someone has an IEP the robot could tell the teacher that the student needs more help on this on subject. The robot could possible help the student understand it. If the student stil doesnt understand the problem or the subject, the robot could go and get him/her and say to them " So and so needs your help on this problem or on this subject." And the teacher would go help them.

Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and and go roge and start herting people. Well if that happended then their would be someone on stand by to turn off the robot and start working on him. So the robot could get back as fast as he could. Well what if that person is sick one day and the robot goes beserk. Then we will have a second person on stand by.

The robot would be good in the classromms. This Coding could be good for students and teachers. If someone has an IEP, the robot could tell the teacher that the studnet needs more help than the other students. Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and go roge and start herting perople. This could be very good for the class room.
