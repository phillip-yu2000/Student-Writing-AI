Dear Principal,

I have heard of the two policies you have been considering, regarding cell phones in school. I just wanted to share with you my perspective about this situation. I believe that you should select policy number one. You want the children to look forward to coming to school, instead of feeling like they are forced to go someplace they dislike. Giving the students the right to use cell phones during lunch periods and other free times will give them the personality that you long to see. Also, if the students want to come to school more often that will have a huge affect on Count Day. If cell phones are used during these free times, i don't really think there will be a disturbance to other students/staff members.

Another, If students from other schools discover the new policy at our school district, they will want to transfer to the district to have these rights. Cell phones have been banned from schools for as long as i can remember; they should experiment with something new, since many generations are passing up the opportunity to still be in school, and just say, "I never wanted to go to school, but I finished."

The only thing is that I don't know what the parents of the children would say. Some might agree with the idea and won't mind their kids using cell phones in school, but some might disagree and want their kids to not be distracted during school, and to just learn the curriculum that the school has to offer. Many people are going to have different opinions, so the best thing to do is to take a poll for this matter. A poll where students and parents vote for what they believe should happen with this whole cell phone policy.

Therefore, my opinion is to choose policy one, where kids can use cell phones during free time. Let the students have some fun. But, it's your decision, you're the principal of this school, not me. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day!

Sincerely,
