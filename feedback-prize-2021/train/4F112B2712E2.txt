Dear TEACHER_NAME (Principal) ,

I think that your consideration on changing school policy so that only grade B average (or better)

students would be allowed to participate in sports or other activities is a smart idea. Students love participating in sports and other activities therefore, students will strive to try to make their grades better. Another reason I think it is a smart idea is because if they do this they wont only be allowed to play sports and activities but would have overall better grades. It would build confidence in themselves that if they want something and if they push themselves hard enough, they will get it. Although these are great reasons some people may think, this new policy might be unfair because everyone should be allowed to participate, but in the end if they work hard enough, they will be able to participate.

This policy will let students reach for something they want, but they also have to work hard for it. In my opinion if i had this option and if i was a grade C average and i wanted to participate in these activities, i would try my best to work hard and do better in school so that i would be able to participate in the activities.

Other student's opinion's count and I'm pretty sure not everyone thinks this policy would be fair, they might argue that your grades shouldn't affect what activities you are allowed to be involved in. I don't agree with this statement because the students who work hard for their grades should deserve a reward and for those who don't, it wont be a consequence but more of a way to motivate those students into doing something better for themselves.

In the end, I think this policy is a great idea because it would give grade B & A students a reward and grade C students motivation to do better.

Thank you,
