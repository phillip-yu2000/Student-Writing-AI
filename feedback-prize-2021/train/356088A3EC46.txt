Dear Principle,

I believe that you should allow us kids to have our cell phones out at school for many reasons. Let me tell you some reasons why you should let us bring our cell phones.

My first reason would be is because if our parents call or text us something that's important, well then we need to check and see what they said. Maybe it is something we need to do for one of our classes, like a missing assignment. Maybe we forgot our lunch at home and our parents are telling us that they are coming to drop it off to us. It is very important that we know these kind of things. Now this is just one reason, but there are plenty more.

My final reason would be what if we wanted to talk to someone that we are not seeing at the time. It would be great if we could check up on them and see how they are doing, just so we are in contact with them. It would be great if this happened because then once class started we would put them right away and start focusing on our learning. I don't think anyone would get in trouble during classes if this happened. I mean we would all be excited if we only have them out for a little bit of time. I could care less how long we could have them for as long as we are able to show them.

Thank you for your time and I hope you consider my idea,

your student,
