When i hear people say they are going to buy a car that can drive its self I always seem to get into a argument with them. It's not that i know someone is smart enough to do that but what's the reason. I see it as if u dont wanna drive then hire someone to drive for you. Having a car that does that is kinda scary in my eyes. Just all the technology that someone has to put into to blows my mind. In the article they went on about say how they have the google car that has gone over half a million miles with out a crash but I truly think thats on roads with nobody else on it. For a car to know when and where to go is easy only thing u got to do is have a gps system but for a car to know when it has to stop all of a sudden is hard. You never know whe you have to make a quick turn so u wont hit anybody or stop fast cause someone hopped out into the street. The way some people drive now a days the car would not know what to do. You could be just laying back in the car that drives it's self and a car cuts you off instead of u being focus on the road your relaxing and you hit and kill someone. Is it your fault or the cars? So in my eyes having cars that can drive them self is not good right now. Their is still of testing to be done. That also mean laws will have to be made just for the person who owns one. The article also went on to say that to alert the driving something bad is about to happen by having the seat vibrate. Thats not a good way to alert someone i'm going to need sounds or something. I just think they should just work out all the kinks first then put the cars out on the lot with data showing you it's save to have one.
