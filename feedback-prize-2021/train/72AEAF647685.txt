Luke and his friends can play too. Luke and the cowboys played things games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing,reading, and more. Luke just doesnt get to have fun, but he does get to explore things during his trips like getting the chance to visist oher countries. Lukes job is pretty fun although it can be very dangerous. Luke has to stay up through the night sometimes no matter what the weather is and watch and take care of all of the animals on board. That part doesnt seem so dangerous does it? The dangerous part is being careful of where you go and where you step.

He was very happy to still be alive, but he still broke his ribs and couldnt work for a while. So over all Luke has a great job as working as a cowboy, you will get some of the only one chance in a life times adventures and decisions even though his job is still pretty dangerous.
