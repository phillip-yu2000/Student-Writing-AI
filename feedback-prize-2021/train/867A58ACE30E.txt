Dear principal,

As we all know, sports or other activities are very important in everybody's life. I heard about your new propose and i decided to talk to you about my point of view. Student are trying their best and putting an extreme effort in their studies and their school works, i think you should do something about it like instead of requiring a letter grade B average to be able to participate in sports and other activities, you should also think that a letter C is a passing letter grade, its a common grade that almost every student gets once a year and that will help you and the school to have a lot of students participating and cooperating in this activities.

Just think about it, a letter C is a passing and sufficient score that's why you should think about it and give students a chance to participate in sports and activities with a letter grade C average which in my opinion it will benefit the students because they are participating and experimenting new things, it will help their social life by making more friends and meeting new people, think that it will also benefit the school by having more students participating in all the activities all of this because a letter C average its a very common grade.

Come on dear principal give the students one more chance to prove you that they will cooperate with you and that they will show you their best academically and physically !

Isn't it an awesome idea ?
