Their is no way that the US can continue approving the electoral college! Its a cotastrophe waiting to happen! The electoral college is going to fall apart any moment. It basically takes away one of every americans best rights, The right to vote! Why would we take time out of our lifes to vote when we are basically voting for someone to vote for us? This can pretty much decide an election and we would have no say. This is a completely unfair part of the election. This is an anachronism and a very non-democratic way of electing presidents. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust has a chance to be betrayed. Although its a small chance it can still happen. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes but Bush had more electoral votes. If the electoral college didn't exist, Gore may have become president and it may have been a much better run. If we have election by popular vote we will get a fair and legit outcome. Their will be no errors or lying or even hacks in the decision or system. That is why the electoral college is not a good system to use for electing a president.       Â
