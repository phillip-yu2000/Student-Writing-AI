Dear principal,

I have read over your two possible policies you have been considering for the schools cell phone policy. I would have to choose policy number one, i will explain why it is the best choose of the two.

Policy one: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class. Most of us kids would want this to be chosen as the schools cell phone policy because we love our cells. We would also be appropriate with them. When we have free time we can text of call people not being loud or bothering anyone at all.

Another reason this is a great idea is because if there is an emergency and no one has a way to contact any one we could use our cell phones to call police, fire men, doctors, animal control, just anyone. Texting will help talk to people who are in different classes about something that might be important to us teens like, a boy your crushing on, new clothes, how amazing you life was the other night.

If you could please change the cell phone policy to allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as phones are turned off during class time, that would be great because then we could text, call, use internet, social networks like facebook, myspeace, twitter, and all those other ones. Cause us teens need our cell phones 24/7. And plus more people would probably try not to sneak cells in and text wile not saps to there would be less drama and we would have more fun.

so please if you will make us more happy in school!
