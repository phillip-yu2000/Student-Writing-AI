Have a person came up to you and ask you for advice and when you give advice to them they go to multiple people to ask them for advice for the same thing that they ask you to make a better choice.

I think that it is OK

because some people might say something negative and some people might say something positive.

they don't know what decision they want to make. They need help changing themselves sometimes about them that they want to change.

The reason i think it is OK to ask multiple people for advice because some people might say negative stuff and some might say positive. I think why some people say negative stuff because they might be negative themselves. Why i think people might say something positive because they positive and they want to help you. another reason they might need help themselves. another reason they might say something positive is so they can become friends with you.

another reason they ask multiple people for advice because they don't know what decisions to make. because sometimes you have more than one option so they go to ask some people for there advice. another reason they have to ask advice for a decision because they don't want to make the wrong decision. they are not good at making they decision don't know how to make solve a decision.

another reason they ask multiple people for advice is because they might to change something about themselves. the reason they want to change something about themselves because they want something better. they want to have friends and change there personality and they want your advice for it. they need someone to talk to because they have none to talk to. they want to make them to fell like them.

in conclusion i think that asking multiple people for advice is good because you get a lot of help from it.
