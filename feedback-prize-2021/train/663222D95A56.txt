when someone asks you for advice , who do you go to ? when that person is needed to be given advice out to , they sometimes talk to more than one person. when you seek multiple opinions, you can get opinions that can add onto your advice or make it less full of detail because if you need to give someone advice , you need to give them some advice that is going to be helpful. it gives you an idea of what others think about toward that opinion and what and why you think what you're thinking about it when someone gives you the same opinion on advice as yours, you won't get that person's point of view since they already have the same idea as you. they won't be able to add onto your opinion of advice.

however, if your opinion goes wrong, their's can work out for you and the person you're trying to give advice to as an alternative if they have a much more different idea than yours, you have their point of view it can give you an idea of whether you want to add onto yours or edit it.

you can know whether your advice toward that person is going to be helpful or not.

it makes you think about how and why you chose that advice you wanted to give out you think about why that person thought about another opinion thats more different than yours, and maybe about how it might impact you

The next time someone asks you for advice , ask other people and see what they tell you . when somebody asks another person for advice , they'll either get the same thing you were having an opinion of or a different opinion. however, there's no right or wrong answer. it all depends on what you're doing an opinion about , but have to think it straight through before giving out that advice. it's a better choice to know what's best then not knowing something straight up that's not true.
