In Vauban, Germany. Residents of the upscale community have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are forbidden in the new district near the French and Swiss borders. The streets are completely "car-free", but downtown Freiburg car ownership is allowed but there is only two places to park- large garage, or a home. 70% of Vauban families do not own cars. A mother of two had said "When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way" as she walks the streets where the swish of bicycles an chatter of children drown the occasional motor.  There's plenty of advantages of limiting car usage. It makes cities denser, and better for walking, planners now takeing the concept to the suburbs.  In a new approach, stores have placed a walk way on a main street, rather than in malls along some highway. Some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed contries but also in the developing world. The Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoing "car reduced" communites.

Cars not only take up space in our cities, and towns, but it also disturbes the peace, and pollutes our air. When you are walking down the road would you rather hear the noise of cars, or the calm enviornment nature has provided us? The air in most communities is so polluted that there is a fog that lurks over their community, not saying it's all because of cars but that is a big factor in the situation.  Reducing cars can reduce the number of deaths, pollution, and reduce noise. More space will be provided for our fellow citizens to walk upon and enjoy the community, roads will be safe to walk across and you wouldn't have to worry about a drunk driving accident. Limiting car usage can be more helpful to your community than it would to be increasing the numbers of cars.
