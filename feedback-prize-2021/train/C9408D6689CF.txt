Dear principal,

I do think kids in the school should do community service. I think that because children should do some kind of physical work. they could do something active to keep them occupied instead of doing something they are not supposed to do. Things like this will keep the kids out of trouble. I think tutoring little kids is a good thing to help them get better at whatever they are working on. Its better than having nothing to do. cleaning up litter is good for the environment.

In my opinion It is a good thing to do with your free time.

other good things to do with your free time are doing extra work at the school. Work like help clean up the lunchroom after school. It is better than going home and playing video games and wasting your time. other people should start to know Its not always about what they want to do.

The big children are supposed to set good examples for them. I recamend you make mandatory for all students to do community
