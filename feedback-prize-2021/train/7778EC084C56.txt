Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students is very valuable! You can tell if they are interested in the current topic that is being teached, Next you can see if they are having a overall good day or bad day at school & finally you can tell if they could be stressed out about something in particular.

I think that it would be a good idea to use this in certain classes that are being teached with like new teachers, or with a new math subject that is currently really hard or easy to see how their overall current mood is at the time being when their face would be getting scanned into a 3-D model and constructs all the 44 facial muscles to see them clearly

Next, in my own personal thinking it would be a good idea to tell how a student is feeling and I think this could save lives, if the student is feeling anger,disgust,fear & sadness and maybe distruction I feel as this could help set up counciling and help the student in need and get him back to a good and happy state to be in and nothing bad might happen in the future.

Thirdly, having the technology to tell if the student is stressed out at home or in the school work place is mostly the best idea to ever have and to see if their are issues at home that is making him/her do bad on their school work. Next it would be good to have seeing a day before a test and seeing if students are worried about a test coming up the day before.

Finally, I believe that having this technology in school could possibly improve grades and overall morale of the school and make it a better and happy & fun place to be at, instead of being the area where we childern frown on and dislike going. Next, I think that having this technology in the classroom seeing if the students are enjoying the subject is a good idea & you could see if their having a good or bad day at school which could save lives in the very long run finally, you could tell if the student is being stressed out or just worried before the day of the test. Overall I think that this would be a great idea to have in classrooms all over the United States and the Nation.
