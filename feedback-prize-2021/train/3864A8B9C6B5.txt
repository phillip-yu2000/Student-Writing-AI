When asking people for advise, I usually ask more than one person for their opinion. By seeking multiple opinions you get views on the topic from different people. That is why seeking multiple opinions makes it so you get more views or opinions on the topic.

Asking more than one person for advise makes it so you can make a better decision, if you just ask one person their opinion could be bias. Also getting more than one persons opinion is better because if you ask a lot of people for their opinion and they all say similar answers, that is most likely good advice, but if you ask one person it could be completely wrong and you would not know.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions helps you get more opinions which helps you understand the topic better. I It also makes you make a better decision because, you get different opinions by hearing peoples views on the topic.
