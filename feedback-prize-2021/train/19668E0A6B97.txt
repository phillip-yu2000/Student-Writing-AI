Dear Mrs Principal

I think that kids should have at least a B grade point average to participate in school sport. I think this way because it is a privilege to play sports that if you don't have at least a B you should have that privilege taken away, and that they set an example of our school and that it would encourage some students to do better so that they could play on the team. I also believe that if the sports team should have at least a B so should the cheer leaders, dancers, book clubs and any other organizations in this wonderful school. I think that if people want to be in originations in this school that they must have there work turned in and get school first because that when they start sports it will take out time they might usually use for studying. I think all practices should be on weekends so that the players have time to do there homework or any missing work.

I think if we change the rule to a B plus fifty percent of the schools students average will rise that we should make all work be turned in first and that it is very important that this school be the best it could be. i believe that if this school can do all this all the schools will look up to us and that would be great for you and us the students in SCHOOL_NAME

love,
