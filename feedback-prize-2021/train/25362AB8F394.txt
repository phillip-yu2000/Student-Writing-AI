Dear Senator,

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter. I would like to bring something to your attention that has been on my mind recently. I think the electoral college is important in picking our presidents and i think that it needs to stay apart of our voting process. The Electoral college is in our history and the founding fathers didnt put it there to just be removed. The Electoral College needs to stay apart of our voting process beause we always have the certainty of outcomes, Everyones presidents, and it avoids run off elections.

With an Electoral College we' ll always have the certainty of outcomes because the winning canidate's share of electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote. Also its highly unlikely for a tie in the electoral college unlike in popularity.

In the Electoral College everyones president. This is such a big part because the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the electoral college.

In conclusion, the electoral college is a great thing for the united states and states. its very much what our founding fathers intendid it to be and it should never be take away. Its neccessary and needed in voting for presidents.
