I believe the face is just a land structure, and so should you. In this short arumentative essay I will try to convinve you that aliens did not make the "Face on Mars". I hope by the end you'll agree with me.

I believe that the "Face on Mars" is just a landform,because the newest pictures of the face, show that it infact is not shaped like a face. The landform is not shaped like a face, but shadows made the structure look like it had all of the human facial features. Also if the "Face on Mars" was created by aiens it wouldn't look like a human, it would look like whatever the aliens look like, unless the aliens look like humans.

I hope that I have convinced you that the "Face on Mars" is infact not a face at all, but only shadows portraying a face on the landform. I believe i have given you enogh evidence, for you to believe that the "Face on Mars" is only shadows. I hope you agree with what i had to say.
