Dear Principle,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME

I'm writing you this letter to let you know that I and other students believe that policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time, should be the new rule or at least try it for a week or two and see how well it works. If it doesn't work that well then don't make it a permanent rule, but if it does go well then you should make it a permanent rule.

I think that being able to use your phone during lunch periods or other free time would be great, because it is so boring for students when all they could do when they are done with everything is sit there. We already have problems with students texting in class, I'm sure if you made policy 1 a rule we would have an outrageous amount of problems lowered.

I have asked quite a few students around school which policy they think would work best, a huge amount of students picked policy one. They also said that they would use this privilege wisely and not hinder it. I agree with these students. Now its all on you.

Your Student,

STUDENT_NAME:)
