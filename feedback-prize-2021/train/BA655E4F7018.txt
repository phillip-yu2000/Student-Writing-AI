Driverless cars are not good. Why do we want more lazy people, more accidents or less reponsible people. By 2020 the world will be destroyed by all the unnessasary stuff we've built just to make it "better". Now a car that can drive itself is just going to make it worse for all of us humans.

Lazy people, we already have enough. In the article it said that the driver needs to stay alert when to turn the wheel, but what if somebody just falls asleep or might end up in the wrong location. If the person in back is just not paying attention could crash.

Teens need to learn how to drive and still have the same rules, permit at sixteen and six months later their license. This still follows up to my last paragh of how you get in an accident. A teen not knowing how to drive because the world told him there are cars that could do the driving for him. He needs to take handle of the wheel if not he'll crash but there's another problem he doesn't know how to because of the car that supposably can do everything itself.

Accidents, could happen anywhere but especially if you have a driverless car. Since people will know they could go anywhere they want without exhausting themselfs because they don't have to drive the roads will probably be crowded all the time. People will want to take long trips because they don't have to pay attention to road ahead.

Driverless cars should never come. They are not safe we don't need more lazy people. Teens should be able to know how to drive for safety reasons. Many accidents can happen because people put their lives in a car. I know that those 2020 cars aren't going to be safe so that's why I we don't need cars that can drive themselves because they really can't.
