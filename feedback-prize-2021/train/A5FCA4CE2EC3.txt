Dear state senator ,

Despite some of the risky things that can come along with Electoral College voting ,voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election .Some people therfore think it is useful and some on the other hand think that it is unfair and that it should be changed .

Fortuatntly though one thing that a Electoral College can promise you is a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible. It happened in 2000 but it is less likely than a dispute over the poppular vote . For exmaple in 2012's election with Obama and Romney , Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner -take-all basis , even a very slight plurality in a state creates a big elecoral - vote victory .

Moving right along , the Electoral college also can aviod Run - Off elections . The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast . For instnace , Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a majority in the electoral college . That situation then creates pressure which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral college. Therefore ,there would be  a clear winner .
