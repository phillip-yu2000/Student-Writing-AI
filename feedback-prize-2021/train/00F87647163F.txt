Did you know that there is a progarm called the Seagoing Cowboys?

The Seagoing Cowboys is a program for cowboys that ride the waves caring for animals.

They care for animals that live on a land that just got destroyed.

There are a bunch of stories about their history.

They have been on the most dangerous assignments.

First of all, there is a reason that you should join.

That reason is to save a lot of animals.

Another reason that you should join this program is that this is right after World War 2, so animals need foof and water.

There is an organization called the

UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) and there is only so much that group can do.

On the other hand, about this Seagoing Cowboys program, you can go anywhere in the world like Europe or China.

You have to make sure that you have enough supplies on the boat to care for the animals.

LIke if u have horses, then you would have hay and oats.

You can also take as many animals as your ship can hold.

One of the boats had 335 horse and still had enough hay and oats to feed them.

For the record, one more reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to go site seeing when ever you want.

You could go see a national landmark while you are on the job.

I remember this one person that was a Seagoing Cowboy, he went to Greece.

The toughest part of this job was going over a bunch of water and getting the animals back to where they belonged.

It would be so cool to be a Seagoing Cowboy.

To sum up my findings, I thought that this passage was a great example o fa job to do if you love animals.

I hope people consider this job.

For th future,

do whta you think is right and never give up if you wnat to go sme where.

You should always follow your dreams even if you don't want to, cause one day that dream might come true.
