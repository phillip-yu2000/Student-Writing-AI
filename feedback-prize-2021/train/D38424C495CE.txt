What I think about community service is that you can spend the time helping your state be a better place. I like community service because I like to take care of my community and help other people when they need helping. One way I would like to help in is doing chores for my mom and dad. I like to help them wash the dishes and get lunch ready for us to eat. In my community, I see a lot of trash on the ground and what I would do about it is pick up a trash can and go around and pick up all the trash in my community. I would also like to cut grass for peoples yards. At my house I always cut the grass in the front yard and in the back yard. Sometimes I take the trash out for my family members. I always love to recycle things like plastic bottles and paper. By doing this, we can save a lot of trees. I love taking care of our community because its fun, easy, and helpful for our state. That's why I think students should be helping community.
