Abolishing the Electoral College sounds like an excellent idea. The election by popular vote is most definetly without a doubt, more fair for the people. Why are 538 people the ones who get to decide who becomes president and not the rest of us? The Electoral College is outdated and too old for todays society. Lets get rid of this while we can.

The Electoral College was made many years ago by the founding fathers, this can tell you it is outdated. People used to have completely different political views back then, we need a fresh start on how we want it today because things have changed. We the people should vote on what we want now an Electoral College vs. a popular vote by the people and redecide since it has been over a thousand years later.

"The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational" says Bradford Plumer in source two. Plumer is right about this, the electoral college is very unfair. How can 538 people decide what happens for the rest of us? It should not be like this, everyone should be equal and all vote then go with the most popular vote for the president. We need to change our ways now before the next election.

Some people may argue like Richard Posner in source three that "the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue..", basically saying the electoral college makes things more equal and fair. What is not fair is that everyone doesn't get to vote directly only the electors do. Many people don't agree with Posner and they shouldn't because the electoral college is the wrong way to run things.

Lets make changes to our future, and abolish the Electoral college. We need to have an election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Fairness and equality is the route we need to take.
