There is a small chance that the picture we saw that appears to be a face was left by ailens. We took multiple photos time and time again and none of them came back the same as the original. Also when we zoomed in there was no evidence supporting that alien built or form the figure that we saw. There was no tracks, no ships, and there was no sign of life.

There was no evidence left on that planet to show ailens where ever there or left the figure we saw. We have natrual land forms and that reminds us of mulitple things. So there is a possibilty that what we saw use to be a old volcaneo or somthing else.

Details that we took from the multiple photos we took don't match or even look like the first photo. All the othere photos we took was better quality than the first and none of them look like the original. So there is a chance that the camera caught somthing that with the unusual shadows was a once in a life time photo.

So what you are saying just doesn't match up with the fact and evidence we have on file. Thats why we beleive it wasnt left by ailens.
