Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this letter to inform you that you should not make every student perform community service. One all students don't have time to stay after school and help out some people have basket ball and football practice I think that we should have a monitor stay around the school and look for the people that litter and make them stay after school.

I think that we the students should choose on if we would like to stay and touter kids For an example some kids don't like other kids and other than tutoring them they could be bulling them we should get older adults to take part in this to prevent thing like this from happening .

Also i think that Community service takes to much time away we need to study and we cant be held up by helping other kids i agree that they need help and i am not against that at all but i think that you should try and help us out and give use a break and only let the students that choose to do community service do it.

After all what i am trying to explain to you that is you should not make every child take part in the community service I hope that you really take my letter into consideration and think about this because from my point of view i think that it is very unfair.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
