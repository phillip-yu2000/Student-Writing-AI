Now, in the world online studeys is usual. A lot of students have online classes. People had ben graduated from online schools and universities, In the past and also now. In my point of view onlin classes is a fortunte for students who did not have chance in the past but, now they have kids so, they can not joyne raguler classes. And online classes is helpfull for students who wants to be educeted. And also for students who are serious about studies. Online classes is d someone who wants to do smething for their futuer to have a bright life. Online classes is great option for several reasons.

Firse, everyone is not that much fortunte to be educeted or to have chance for study when they are youn. Like me I borne in that country, that the women do not had chance to study. 80% of women is uneduceted, I am on of them.

Now I have kids, the online option is a great idea for me. Because I have to take care of my children beside of my education.

Second, if student wants to be educeted the online classes is a very good option to be them if they can not reach schools. Coming to school is not a point, to get knowledge is a big point. It does not essential to have to go to school get clacces. You can get knowledge whowever you want.

Third, for serious student it does not metter if the classes is online or it is unonline they will get what they need. Like me it does not emportent for me net classes or joyinable classes, I wants to go a head and fonish my school first than I will cuntinue my education.

In coclusion, oline classes will bring happiness for sudenta was deprived from school, and for student who wants to finish their school, college and for studen who determine to will don colleg or university.
