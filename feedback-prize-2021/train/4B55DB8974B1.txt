DERA PRINCIPAL

We dont think you shud of changing the average .It not ferar to the other student and a c average is okay that what i thank about it .

maybe that all they can get at the last minent to pass for they can play there sport and it passing and at less it not a d .

And if you reas the average to a b you wont have anyone planing for the time and we will loss like ever game

What im tring to say if you raes that averag no one will be planing sport olee but the smart kids well be planing and that going to be funny and sports are my thing and i realy wont to be a football player for an NFL

teem and i wont to be the best and how am i supst to do that and your thing to reas the averages to a b and i passing with a c. And i realy dont think that fear and im vere good at what i do and i dont think your doing a vere good job and that the reasn you shudent cang the average for the school and in i dont think any one well like that anyways and y would you do that anyways cuz that realy dumm of you and perant wouldent like that . then you well be geting com plants from pernts about y the kid isent plan for the time and i dont think you wont to be and that .so ples dont chang the average by STUDENT_NAME
