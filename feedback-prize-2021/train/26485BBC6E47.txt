dear, principal i agree with policy 1its perfect i think you should allow student to use there cell phones in launch period and any free time but have them completely turn of during class because its not like the cell phone is a bomb or anything its just a cell phone, also cell phones do come in handy like in a case of an emergence during school , and i think its fun to use your cell phones burring your free time and enjoy it!!

i don't get how teachers are so uptight about having cell phones in school they act like its a bomb or something its not! its just a cell phone. i think if you would choose policy 1 student will respect it and only have there cell phones on during free time or lunch think there is no reason for school not to allow student with cell phone to me this makes no sense cell phone can come in handy one day in school for a student for an example a student can be feeling bad during launch and needs to go home the student can call home and have a parent pick them up.

most of all i think its fun that a student can use there cell phones burring launch or free time because you can text you friends that are on the other side of the lunch room and ask them of they want to have lunch together its so cool and exciting and there is no harm in doing that its not bad or mean so i don't understand why teachers are to strict with cell phones.

well i hope you do choose policy 1 because students would love that and enjoy it much more and to me i think student would be more relaxed and not worried about there cell phones getting taken away for no reason and i think even parents would very much like this idea as well because they don't have to be coming to school all the time to get there child's cell phone from the office.
