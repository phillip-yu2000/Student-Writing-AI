CELLPHONES AT SCHOOL

We should be allowed to have phones at school becauseifsomrthinghappensand you mother or father can call you and tell you that something happened and they can tell you that they are on the way. Yes, students need to be allowed to have phones out at lunch and free time because free time is a break and lunch time is our break so we they should let us play with the phones and text people and call them . But phones during class that is a no because some people wont to learn and they don't wont to be annoyed by you play your music and the teacher can teach so we can do good on test. An if you are caught with your phone in class the teacher got a right to take it and give it to the principle because you should not have it out in class so you cant get it back until June 1 an your parent have to come get it back for you and you cant have it back at school again. An that's why the principle should let us have phones at school in free time and lunch time and not in class.
