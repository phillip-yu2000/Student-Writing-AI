The Unusual Rock Formation

When the "Face of Mars" was discovered many people had very different accusations and claims. Many people(including scientists) thought it was created suddenly by aliens. Although, that can be a possibility, it really wasn't the case for this certain situation. The reason being, was because NASA along with its scientists have many reasons for the "Face of Mars" to be a just a natural landform on Mars. They even have enough evidence to supprt their perspectives of the identity of the "Face of Mars".

First, the scientists took many sharpening images to see all the specific details of the this natural rock formation. In the article, it states that photographing Cydonia became a priority of NASA. That this huge rock formation was only made by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The scientist not only took one photo, and were done with the discovery, they took many photos. As the article shows that they took many photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001, the scientists took the information they had, and came to a conclusion, that this was only a gigantic rock formation.

Furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also discovered that this landform didn't have anything unusual because they can basically see everything from their spacecraft. As the article states, they took the digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This mean that the scientists throughout the years have made this photos more and more sharpenly to see all the details, and see exacly what this mystery of a rock formation is. So, when they took the pixel size larger and larger they realized they reached the end of their discovery. The reason was because it was really zoomed it, that even if there were Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks you could see them.

Then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. Scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact. Even though the scientists couldn't get a valuable picture of the formation because of the wispy clounds, many people believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. On the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock.

In conclusion, the "Face of Mars" is only a simple rock landform with an unusual formation of a human face. There are many reasons why,including the photos, and how they came to be much sharper and detailed by the range of the pixels. Also, the rock formation was in Cydonia, whcih really wan't a mysterious plant, considering that NASA immediately got informed by it.

Even though, there has been enough evidence in photos, many people believe it was created mysteriosly be aliens. In the end, it's just a landform in a whole different planet, so how can one simple face-like formation be created by aliens?
