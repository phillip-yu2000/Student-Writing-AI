State Senator,

The Electoral College is outdated, and is commonly viewed as anachronism. In this system voters, instead of voting for a president, vote for a slate of electors. The slate of electors if chosen for the statewide election, would go to Congress. At Congress, they would then vote for the President. For many people, it seems understandably unfair.

First off, voters cannot control who their electors vote for. At this point in time, voters have no more of a say in which President is elected - they can only hope that the elected candidate shares the same views they do. Most of the times, this is the wrong case.

Second off, many times voters will get confused in who they're voting for. They'll pick out a candidate without knowing much information about them, or what their views are. A random candidate will be chosen for their vote, and most times this tends to come to an unhappy ending. Many times, voters will be disappointed and frustrated with how the election turns out.

People claim this tends to be due to the Electoral College.

It would, in terms, be much simpler to change the election to go by popular vote. This would have many benefits on the difficulty of the systems selecting a President, to how people react. By choosing a popular vote, time of the election would be cut slimmer. People wouldn't have to focus on choosing an elector, or their worries that their state electors didn't share their views. It would give our people the chance to vote for the President they want.

In the end, the Electoral College should be abolished and thrown out. It doesn't make sense to keep continuing on this way, when the votes should be up to the people - not random electors.
