Dear Principal

It is true that some students have a C average, but these students are great at the sport they are playing. They may become somebody when they get older. School comes first, but at the same time the coach needs that student to perform and do his/her best at that sport. The team may need that student for a game or so to win the District Championship for the school and hang a banner up. So if a student has a C average then let that student play that special game and he or she will make up all the bad grades they have made. Games are important for a kid if there in school because it may be the last game they play ever, but they wont know it unless they play school sports and at school sports may help you with what you may want to do when you get older in life. Students like reputation, so to get that they need to play sports in school to get noticed by any professional sports team. This may be there dream in life and may be something they want to do if they don't want to have a job. More likely the kids will get a job, but just let these kids play there sport and they will do anything to pay you back in return. If they get older and play for a special team they might say your name when they get drafted by a team and just because of you when you let them play that game they will respect and care for you at all times because you helped them get somewhere in the big world. If you give them a opportunity to achieve something they might do the same thing for you. You never know how kids can be when they get in the real world. It just might surprise you.
