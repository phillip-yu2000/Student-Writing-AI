Dear Principle,

I think the best way too do this is too let them have a C but when there season starts then have one practice be a day when they study on there work there missing. I mean yea a C is not the best thing for you too have so you can get in a College but its better then a D. And maybe if the student is smart he will realize if he really likes that sport then he would get that grade up to a B or better because the best student would want too over achieve in there life to get where they want too be.

And the students have too remember that they are a student athlete and when you are that, that means you have too do your work be for you want to play that sport. So I really think we should see if the students would rather be a C student and while they play one of there practices can be where they do there work instead of practice so they can get there grades up.

So that's how I feel bout having a B just too play a sport. A C should be good enough for that student to play that sport. So do you agree with me?
