Dear Sir or Madam,

I believe that if you are reconsidering the cell phone policy for our school you should choose Policy 1. I think this because if our phones are off in class but during our lunch break and other free times that are longer than switching time we could have them on than school would be a better place to be, for students anyways. As long as we're not texting friends answers to test, then what could be the harm?

If we're not allowed to have phones at school at all (even if their off) and something bad happens, like the school catches fire or something, we would need a way to contact our parents quickly. Tell them what happened, assure them everything is fine, tell them we need a ride home because school can't continue because of what happened. Information like that wouldn't get through very fast. With a couple teachers phones and many, many students. We could pass the information faster if we had our own phones.

So by choosing Policy 1, you would be making many students, parents, and maybe even a few teachers happy. If you would consider what I've said we all (the student body) would appreciate it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
