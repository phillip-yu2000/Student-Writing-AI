Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that requiring students to perform community service is not the right decision to make.

We may have things that we have to do after school.

Some kids would not have time to perform community service because we may have a lot of homework to do, have basketball practice and need to assist our parents with grocery shopping or babysitting.

The students who actually have time to perform community service, should join.

Those are the people who should be told to perform community service hours.

The people who actually have nothing to do after school and are looking for things to do should be joiniingg the .

Since they have free time and aren't participating in some school club or sport, then they should be apart of the community service.

The others, like myself, are already participating in things, and it puts more of a burden on us having community service to do on top of sports, homework, and assisting your parents.

My final decision is No, that you, our Principal, should not require students to perform community service because not all of us can do it, since we already involved in after school activities.

If we did have to perform community service, then the we would be stressed and be lacking in all of our things because of all the things we have to do and I am sure that is not what you had in mind when you thought of this plan.

After listening to my point of view, do you really think this idea is the best thing for the students of SCHOOL_NAME?

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
