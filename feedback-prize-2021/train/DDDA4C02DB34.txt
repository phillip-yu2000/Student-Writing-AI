It is important to hear other people's advice so they won't in example fall into peer pressure by their friends and people around them and another example is to help them with things in life like how to handle a situation properly or even how to be prepared for a test. Hear people out so you can be a better human being. My second reason is to hear other peoples opinion on like if you ask someone how do you like this phone and they hate it but other people love it,you can think for yourself and decide if you want to buy this phone or not. Another reason is to make the right decisions in life and not to do risky behavior like smoking,drinking,and other bad things in the real world. Don't be influenced by one but multiple opinons because it might cause you to do the right thing and put you on the right path. Lastly,You can be better at something like at sports or in school by listening to opinions from different kinds of people from around the world and be the best version of yourself in life.
