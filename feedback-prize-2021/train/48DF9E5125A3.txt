Google has had cars that can drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a future with a public transportation system, where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. I believe this would be efficient use of driverless cars and it would be a large improvement to our transportation system today. "Driverless" cars still need drivers, or managers, to control the car, which would provide more jobs in large cities. Driverless cars would be able to use half of the fuel of todays taxis while offering far more flexibility with carpooling.

In 2013, BMW announced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant." The car can handles driving functions at speeds of up to 25 mph, while touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel in case of complex driving issues or a collision or near-collision. None of the cars developed today are completely driverless. They can do basic driving functions such as steering, accelerating, amd braking themselves, but are designed to notify the driver when he/she should take the wheel. This means the human driver must remain alert in case he/she should have to take over.

We could have large ammounts of cars in cities like this. It would provide jobs for the managers of the cars, while ammounting to less accidents on the road. All the smart cars could interact and communicate to each other to alert managers to accidents or taffic problems ahead. This technology could also be used to prevent more collisions.
