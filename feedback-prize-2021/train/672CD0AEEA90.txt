Dear the principal,

I am so against the change you making for sports, not everybody can get a B grade average. That is completely unfair to students who gets a C grade average. I you need to take consideration on this before you do.

So just because a student has a C grade average they cant play sports, so know you are denying physical activates for your students. That's bad i don't think the board would want to here this.

Nope at all, i think the parents would get mad too just there child is trying to get a C grade average they cant play sports. What if you have all advance classes can the student still play. i two high school classes and let me tell you they are not the easiest classes in the world to pass with a B or higher.

I still don't like the idea but i understand what you are doing. If a student wants to play sports that bad they do there hardest to raise there grade up. That a good motivation thing to do to get the students up. If half 75% students are playing sports that means they are making good grades. but no every student is like that though you cant punish the students just because they don't make a B grade average.

Do not change the school policy because a lot students will not be able to play sports. A lot of students wont get the fitness they need every day.
