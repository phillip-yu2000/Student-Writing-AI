Dear Principal,

I think that people who maintains a B average should join any sports or any other activities because it shows that they can balance school work sports, and other activities People sometimes put sports first than school work, In some schools, the students need at least 2.0 gpa to join any type of sports. If they do have a C average, they should try hard to get it up to a B average. I think it seems fair that the standards to be active in sports is having a B average, because if the standards were a C average then maybe some students might not give 100% effort on their work. Also usually a C average can drop down fast. I know that many students can reach a B average if they try, and if they maintain a B average then they don't have to worry. Being in a sport is a privilege , its an opportunity but it comes with consequences. If you don't have a B average then you can't join any sports. I know a person who is in a volleyball team, she works super hard in volleyball and she still has time to do all her homework. She's only in ninth grade and she can already balance time on her school work and practicing on volleyball. She loves volleyball so if she drops her 2.0 gpa. she knows she can get kicked off the team, that's why she perseveres to maintain a 2.0

gpa. So you see, maintaining a 20. gpa. or a B average is important to get in a sport or do fun school stuffs because if they can't maintain good grades then they can't have the privilege of joining a sport or joining clubs
