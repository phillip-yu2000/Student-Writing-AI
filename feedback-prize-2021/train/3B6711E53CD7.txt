My position on the driverless car is i think it is very interrestiing on how it works but it wouldnt be something i would want to have or "drive". My reason being is that like it said in the pasage is that they aret completly driverless you still have to be alert so when you have to take over for the car you can which i think would be pointless because if the car was 100 percent driverless on a long trip you could take a nap or text people or get on social media but with these cars like the passage says is that if there is construction then the person has to take over so its bascilly like driving you just dont have to control the car all the time but another down fall is that you have to keep your hands on the sterring wheel all the time because in the passage it said the steering wheel had sensors in it to make sure the driver was alert in case of a problem.

Another thing is the fact that if you were to get in a accident in the car would it be your fault or the car companys and how would insurance take care of that if one person was in a driverless car and the other was not or if both were in a driverless car who would be a fault and have to pay, how would insurance work because insurance is based on the human driving past and experience but if the car was driving how would the insurance be based.
