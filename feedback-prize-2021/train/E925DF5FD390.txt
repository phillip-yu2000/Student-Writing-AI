Driverless cars seems like a great idea doesnt it? But think about it, people in the future are not really going to know how to drive a car. Cutting the past out isnt going to help in the furure.

First of all, Getting a driverless car you still have to drive. No one wants to drive a driverless car, and thats where a lot of crashes are goin to start. A lot of people are not going to be paying attention. Especially on the highway because the car can steer, accelerste, and brake themselves but cannot drive themselve through road work. Thats where the accdient is going to happen at, if the driver is not paying attention.

Additionally, most states have made it illegal to test computer driven cars. They say the law will be tooken down once the cars are approved. But what if in some states they dont take the law down, if the driver has to go through that state to get to another, there's going to be a problem. The driver then has to drive. But the driver doesnt really know how to and they only know parts of driving because the car did the rest of that.

Also, a driverless car is a very nice kind of car. they steer it self, accelerate , and brake themselve. It can function its speed up to 25 mph. Has a special touch sensor to make sure the driver has control of the wheel. Plus has an alert system to when there is a problem ahead the car can't keep control anymore.

In conclusion, cutting the past out isnt going to help the future. People in the future are not really going to know to drive. Contact Tesla and Google confounder Sergey Brin to tell them if this writing sounds .
