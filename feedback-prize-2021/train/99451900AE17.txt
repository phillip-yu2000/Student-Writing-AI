"Hey Generic_Name! I'm trying to ask out this girl but I don't know what to say, so I need some advice." Generic_Name said, "Oh okay. You should tell her..." I said "I need some more advice because his advice might not work."

People seek multiple advice because they can get more than one answer to a problem. They do that so they can summarize and break down each advice that was given to see which works well with your problem. If someone ask you the same question, it will help you give another person some advice and help them. If you ask only one person for advice then you will barely get any information for the problem.

Pros:

It will help you give another person advice that was giving to you before

People give you multiple answers and use which one that will work out well.

It will give you a plan B if the first advice doesn't work

Cons:

They could give you bad advice and will effect you.

Before you get advice, ask someone that has experience it before or know about it. If they've never experience it before or know about it then they could give you the wrong advice or they wont know. I ask for multiple advice before and it works out well because someone gave me a lot of advice to a certain problem I had. So this is a good idea if you need some advice.
