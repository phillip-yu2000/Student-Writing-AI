I believe that driverless cars should still be worked on. They would make life much simpler, and could also save a lot of people a lot of time. Driverless cars are the future, and we should be ready to embrace them.

If driverless cars do become a thing in the future, lives would be more convenient. If they managed to make them able to work completely without human assistance, then people wouldn't have to focus on driving. If they need to get something done in a short amount of time, they could just use a driverless car, that way they could work on it while on the road. Of course, since the few driverless cars there are now still need human assistance, this could take quite a while to develop, but I'm sure they'll get that far eventually.

There are some people who drive really slow, and some who drive really fast. With driverless cars, this would not be an issue, as all the cars could go the same speed, so everyone could get to where they need to go in time. As for the issue of possible crashes, if all the cars would be programmed the same way, this wouldn't be a problem. If there are still crashes, that would be a manufacturer thing. They were the ones who built and program the cars, it's their responsibility to program all the cars to be as safe as possible, so no one can get hurt.

This could also save people money in the long run. Since all the cars would be programmed the same, therefore no more wrecks, people wouldn't have to worry about having to buy a new car in that event. Also, they could just take the public transport car, and have it go wherever they need to go, since they would be much more accessible.

In conclusion, Driverless cars should definitely be a thing we need to keep working on. They could benefit the world so much. Plus, things would be a lot more interesting with driverless cars.
