Dear principle,

I believe that policy 1 is a better policy because students can communicate more often and they will respect the policy more than the 2 option. It is better because the students can now be helping each other with out being together during their free time.

They can communicate more by being calling each other or texting with out being in the same place as the other person they can help each other, they can even find each other at school by saying were they are at school.

They will respect there policy because they a chance to bring there phones to school and can use them during there free time. They will know that they can't use them during class and they can only use them during there free time only. they will respect it because they know if they don't respect it they will lose their chance to bring them.

They will help each other without being there in the same place and will not have to go to the same place. It will make school more easier and will have good grades because of the extra help. They will not be walking long distances just to get help from their friends when they can get it boy just calling or texting.

That is why policy 1 is better because you can communicate better and get help without traveling long distances and do better in school. They will respect is because if they don't their chance will be taken away.

sincerely,
