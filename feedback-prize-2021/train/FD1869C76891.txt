Dear Principal,

My name is, STUDENT_NAME. I am in the 8th grade at your school. The new policies you have created are kind of outrageous to me and other students attending your school. I run track and have a lot of friends that play many different sports. Most of us aren't making the grades that meet the standards of your policy. So i am writing a letter to you to ask you to please remove the policy.

I know you are going to tell me that you are very upset with most of the students grades, but a lot of us are trying. School and home can get very stressful, And when I have a stressful day or one of my friends do. We all like to come to our practices or something to help get it off our minds. Sports help a lot of us to relax and think clearly. Mostly to get stuff off our minds.

I pay more attention to my school work than I do sports. I always complete my homework and have it turned in on time. Its just the new policies you have made are keeping me from doing what I love. Its hurting a lot of the students too. It breaks my heart that i don't get to go to the track meets anymore, due to my grades. So now I just go home and do nothing, And who wants to go home and just do nothing ? Not this guy! Sports are like a getaway for a lot of students, And now most of us do not have that anymore. The new policies probably will start affecting my grades more than ever before.

So I'm asking you if you would please put the new policies on a low or you know you could just remove them. I'm very stressed from school and home. I have no relief anymore. But I'm not Speaking out just for myself. I'm talking and speaking out for every student in the school that feels the same way. So if you could please remove the policies I will get better. And for the new policy, I don't thank you. . .

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME

8th grade student
