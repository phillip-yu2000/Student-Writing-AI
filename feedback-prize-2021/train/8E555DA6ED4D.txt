I think they would not benefit from this, because its a lot of money, people might learn better in person, also it would be better for people to interact with one another and that wont workout if they are taking online classes. Here are my explanations why!

People might not have the money to do online classes because they are so expensive. They might not get payed enough or might not work enough, or might not even have a job. The expenses could range up to over hundreds of dollars not even with the equipment. They could possibly hardly be making it by. They also could have bills and taxes to pay when it comes.

Students might learn better in person because of how they were taught or what they know. It might be hard for people to learn through a screen, they might have to be a hands on person in order to learn. They also might have a learning disability,so that might make it hard for them to learn also. Everybody learns in different ways such as such as some might be quicker than others and some might be slower than others. Also if you were taught from home it could be hard for you to pay attention and keep focus.

Students also need interaction with others. If they are cooped up in their house all day that will lead them to signs of depression. So maintain their interaction with others would be very recommended because its not healthy not to talk to some some. Talking is a very healthy way of expressing yourself or making friends. If you do online classes then there is a less chance of you making friends and interacting with others.

In conclusion I think being taught at home or online classes is a bad idea because of all the possibilities such as,its a lots of money people might not have, people learn in different ways, and people need interaction in their everyday to day life.
