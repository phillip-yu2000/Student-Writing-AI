dear principal,

many of the students playing sports have a C average. if you change the policy that will leave most of are team with hardly any players or with non at all. By keeping the policy the same you will be saving the athletics and many other programs in our school. it is every hard to blanc sport and school at the same time, so maybe the C average is the best that student can do and by making the average a B could be very stressful and hard to achieve for some of the players. keeping the same average is a achievement that all of the students playing sports and other activities is conscionable to them. every student works hard in their studies to keep that C average. maybe all of the extra work that the students will have to do to is to much or hard for them. many of the students feel the same way as i do because most of them play sports and find it harder to blanc the new grade average with sports and that might cause them to quit. so this is why i am asking you to keep the average the same.
