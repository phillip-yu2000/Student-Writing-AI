Dear Principal,

If you change the policy so the students don't get to participate in sports or other activities the students will have a reason for not going to school. School is a place for social and enhanced learning. Kids get to have friends in school and with the sport activities it makes it easier to get friends. Friends are important for the learning process because friends help each other when they don't understand an assignment in school.

Student cant find any reason for coming to school if they don't find it interesting. They'll think its just a waste of time if they cant have fun. If the students don't go to school then schools will shut down and the mayor will get disappointed. Even though this will get their heads into studying more; other kids wont care. When the children who do work hard see that their friends don't care, they'll give up.

Students like having activities after doing hard work. Some kids try their best to succeed but the passing grade is just to high for them to reach. You shouldn't blame them for not having the ability to make progress by taking sports and other activities away. Some children cant even find help at home either because their parent don't speak English or their parent don't care whether their son/daughter get to be someone when they grow up. Its not their fault they have no reason to do better in school when they think the people around them don't care. You should think twice about taking things away from the innocent.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
