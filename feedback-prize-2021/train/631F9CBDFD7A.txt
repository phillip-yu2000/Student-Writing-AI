Would doing school work at home benifit you? Working from home would benifit me because I can take breaks whenever I need to, as some students like work on the computers, and may see their family.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I don't get stressed or angry. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they don't want to do it at home. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%.

In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it.

Lastly, some students don't want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that can't leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when we're 20-21 or sooner. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools.

Overall, Working from home would benifit me because I like to work on the computers, I can take breaks, see my family, and be on my couch.
