A big sum of people would definitely say that having online classes would be quite beneficial to a majority of students. For those who cannot travel to school can just go on a device and learn! Though, if you were to dive deeper into this you can notice the cons. What worries me about this is the fact that the internet can fail you. What would you do if your device crashes out of nowhere? What if the source you are using stops working? What would you do if that becomes a common thing? You wouldnt be able to get your schoolwork done. What about those who cannot afford laptops? Will the school provide the laptops for them? To some people this may not come off as something that is important. Would you rather to risk all of those complications just to do it online? In this case it would be so much easier to just try to attend classes at school. Attending school online may seem fun though it is not as easy as many may think. Therefore, you dont have to worry about any devices crashing and you'll get to learn if you attend school non virtually!Â
