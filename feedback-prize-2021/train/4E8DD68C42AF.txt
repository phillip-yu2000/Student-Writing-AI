Have you ever thought of going overseas to a different country? Well my name is Luke and I always wanted to go overseas for my entire life. When I wasm 17 years old my friend Don invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Well of course I couldn't say no jto that because I thought it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

You should fully consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you do, you can see so many new thing and experience many things you have always wanted to experience. While I was on my first trip when Don invited I almost died but only because it was a very rainy night. That doesn't mean you have a high chance that you can die, it just means you have to very very careful when it is a rainy night. It was 1945 World War II ended, and many countries were in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. So then that is when Don and I signed up.

I turned 18 before arriving Greece, which meant I could be drafted into the military. When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip, they told me to just keep doing that for my service. I think the cattle boat trips are unbelievable for a small-town boy. Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special. The next special thing I got to do was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.

In my opinion you should definetly consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. Next if you do end up joining it then you will have the best time or experience your whole entire life. The best part about it was if you don't want to go into the army and you turn 18 while you are in the middle of your trip you don't have to join the Seagoing Cowboys Program.
