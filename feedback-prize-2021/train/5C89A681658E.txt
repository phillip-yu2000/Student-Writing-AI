Dear, Mr. Senator

I am writing to you about keeping the electoral college. To me the electoral college is key to the United Stats of America. Why would we replace something that has worked for over 200 years? The founding fathers some of the greatest men to ever live came up with this idea of the electoral college, and now some congressmen want to just get rid of it. As you can tell this makes my temper itch just writing about it. This country has run on this system for grnerations but now people clam it is out dated. Now dont get me wrong I see where they are coming from but the only reason I've found that people dont like this system is either because it has some minor hiccups or that the canidate that the person favored lost. Now I understan how this can upset some one but it doesn't mean we have to compleatly abolish the system. The hiccups in the system dont even happen every election which to me makes the problems irrelevent. Well anyway i'm done ranting so you can continue on with you day

Sincearly,

Jackson
