Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would like to disagree with your opinion of making the rule of kids having to have a B or above to participate in our sports teams. If you create this rule you are breaking a child's dream of being in the Major Leagues or ending up to be in the World Cup one day. I believe every child in this world deserves a chance to chase after their dreams. If you create this rule you are destroying a child mentally and physically. That child who practices every day to succeed in what he wants to do with his or her life will give up their practices and become an obese kid who sits down on a couch thinking why the principle hates everyone. Because of people like you, who prevent hundreds of kids to follow their life long dreams and stop them exercising, we end up with more homeless people, more gangsters, more drug addicts, and more deaths. I believe this crisis needs to stop now. I know they have not met their recommended academic level, but they do have their own dreams and their own goals and i believe that it is evil to take that away from the kids who are affected by your actions. I cannot understand why you would even consider creating this rule. We as a school must abolish this idea of such a rule. You have had your chance so let others have the same chance as you have had. Please take this message into consideration.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
