Dear Principal,

I would like to take position in weather students should be required to perform community service because I think that we should do it not only for our community but for our nation, family and friends because it is not fun to litter and we would be doing you a favor. So elementary student go out and help our communities. Trust me you will always have the time to go out and do what you want to do.

so come on and let us help out our community by cleaning up in our home towns. If our school did this as a group project we would not just be helping ourselves but a lot of people , animals, and countries. We could even recycle bottles newspapers and cans.

Please let us go out and help our community, and save the lives of many creatures I don't just want my school to do this I want everyone to help make a difference in the world if everyone cleaned up a little bit every day I promise you we will be a happier and cleaner nation. I would like it very much if you did this for our countries.

Sincerely,
