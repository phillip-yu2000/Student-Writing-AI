I think the use of Facial Action Coding Symstem is an great way to identify students emotions. I believe that most students in classrooms become sod or lonely when he/she is doing work that the student doesn't understand. So with the facial action symstem it can interact with students to change their emotions from sad to happy.

It can help change emotions by showing different thing on the computer screens,for and example a student can be sad and the facial regonition can see that he/she is sad and then put something thats joyful on the screen.

The computer can tell if the a student is pretending to be happy or sad by your mucles. Pretending to be happy or sad will cause the symstem to bringout the student real emotions. Most students try to act sad to bring atttion to themselves. If a student appears sad to another student the other students tends to comfront him/she in the wrong way.
