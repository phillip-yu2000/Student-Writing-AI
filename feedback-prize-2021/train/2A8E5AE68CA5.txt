Young adults, who attend Generic_School, should be in a extracurricular activity because they will learn team work skills, get some exercise, and might even enjoy that activity.

To began with, learning how to team work with others is a every important skill to have but not a lot of people have it. Why should teens know team work skills because having team work skills will help them in a long way, like an example a football teams, if on one isn't lessening to no one then there team will probably lose every signal game, the reasoning is that, no one has team work skills. How can they learn team work skills, is by teaching them to understanding others and knowing others for who they are as a person because if they don't want to do it, then why should the other person do it, so teach be the one and get to know them.

Also, getting exercise every day is good for there body and health, it feels so good after tacking a nice hot shower at home. When you'er sitting in school all day it feels good to run right after school, letting all of your energy out and burning all of the extra calories that they ate at lunch. A teen want's to lose some weight so with a lot of exercise that the one teen could lost a lot of weight.

Finally and lastly, they could be good at the activity and really enjoy it and want to prose it when they are all grow up. Image some teen who never played football but he/she tried out for it and made it and he/she really likes it also pretty good at it but he/she will never had knew that if he had never tried out for it. In the future he/she wants to pursuit it for a there job so he/she joins a football team and could join the NFL one day.
