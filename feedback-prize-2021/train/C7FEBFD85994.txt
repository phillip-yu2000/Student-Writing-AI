This program has been a very good experiance, ''luke has said.

I got to learn how to feed the animals and keep watch.

It? even better since Don is with me. I think that this Seagoing Cowboy is a great program. Since this is such a great progam I should convince other people that they should join. There are many reasons why.

People should join us. People should join the

Seagoing Cowboys. The first reason why is that there could be more people feeding the animals,water them two or three times a day. They could make sure thet there was hay for the animals. Also the people can be a watchmen or two. The people could also be night watchman.

They could just help others. Some people could go on an other ship and do other jobs there. They can have some animals in a pen. They can have a person to care for them. They could have the same jobs on the first ship but be on another ship so they can deliver the animals and get more done and be able to deliver them at the same rate.

"If I asked more people to come and help it would be a huge opportuinity for them to take. they would get the experiance to serve the ship and do what has to be done," said Luke. Everyone who took the chance or job would be a huge help. We could have many ships go out. They could get the job done.

So explorers, if you would like to have an adventure this is the job you may want to try. People will realize or they will be aware of people in their countries and their needs. As a group effort people make a difference. This job would be good for you. This job isn't all about hard work. There are some fun things too. You would get to meet other people as well.
