Dear SCHOOL_NAME principal,

I think that the new policy on grades and sports is a great idea. Many students have a hard time at keeping their grades up while playing school activities. The new policy of having to have a B average to play is a great idea. There are many kids that have a C or lower average in one or more classes. To be good at sports I also think you should have good grades. To be able to get into a good college you must have good grades. So I think it is very important that kids keep B and A averages throughout grade school. If you are taking on the responsibility to play a school sport, you should be responsible to do all your school work and to try to get good grades. The new policy is a great way to keep kids focused on school. If the students really want to play a sport they will try harder and all their grades will go up and they can participate in school activities. In conclusion, I think the new policy for sports is a great idea.
