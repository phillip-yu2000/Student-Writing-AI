My school has many great students in it. It shouldn't matter what grade you have to do something that you love. Many students with a C would be highly disappointed with this outcome. They may be overwhelmed in this decision and may think they are not good enough to do anything. That leads to problems out of school, those kids may get into more trouble, because if you are not involved in any after school activities many kids get bored. So if you are occupied after school you stay out of harm and so do the people around you.

You also improve as a person by being involved in after school activities. You get social skills and have an increase in friends which is great for improving on your confidence . So you will be a confident person by feeling important by being apart of something and your grades shouldn't stand in your way of that.

If your grade is lower than a C, than I don't think you should be aloud to participate an after school activities, because if you are not trying you shouldn't be rewarded by having fun. But I and other students strongly agree that having to have at least a B is a bit harsh, a C is not a bad thing and should not be held against anyone, in their decisions to improve their lifestyles, by taking part in activities after the school day.

So I and my other of my fellow students agree that you shouldn't have to have a B average to participate in any after school activity, but you should have at least grades that are C'S and higher. Please take this into consideration, and we will respect the decision that you will chose to make.
