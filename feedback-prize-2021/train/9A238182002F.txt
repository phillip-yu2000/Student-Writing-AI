The author supports the idea of pursuiting the planet Venus by giving us all of the benefits we could obtain from visting this planet.

What our planet Earth could benefit and learn about planet Venus. Having the ability to learn about if there was something there before and trying to improve the conditions of the area now so that humans and animals from Earth could possibly live in. If NASA were to figure out a way onto the planet, they could look and obtain samples of rocks, gas, and anything else to conduct research on the things that are on that planet and learn things that they do not know about the planet. Being able to view the analogous to planet Earth and see first hand what can be compared and contrasted about the valleys, mountains, and craters. It would give NASA the chance to see what kind of organisms may or may not have lived on the planet in the past. It could help the people that are on planet Earth understand what kind of innovations and improvements could be made and possibly create living conditions for organisms in the present or in the future. It would also give a better idea of what is on the planet rather than depending on photography or videography.

Venus is considered to be our sister planet because it is the most alike and also the closest planet to us. Viewing this and the things on it could be a big deal for planet Earth and also will be a great idea to see and test what is around us.
