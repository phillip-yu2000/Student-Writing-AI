Dear principal,

I have heard that you are thinking about requiring all students to do community service. Because some kids have been doing it and they like it. But also some kids do not like it they say it takes time away from there day. I believe that you should not require all students to take part in community service because they should not be forced to do it and kids who do pick up there own trash should not have to pick up others.

I think that kids can not be forced into community service by there school principal because the only person that can do it is a judge for punishment. But you cant force it for not doing anything wrong. I think that It is unconstitutional and should go to court if this were to happen. Also some parents may not like this due to after school activities. Or if they did it during the school day the kids aren't learning during school hours.

Also some kids could pick up there own trash and they don't want to pick up someone else's trash. And if they made it a team thing or a group thing then that's a socialist way of doing it and trust me no one will help a slacker in a group. That's how a steal case building is going out of business hear because they went from doing work on your own to a team working environment.

Now you may say that we aren't punishing them and that it teaches them to keep the environment clean. But in reality the kids are going to feel that they are being punished. And trust me they are not going to have fun. And come home saying they were so lucky to pick up old rotten trash of the road.

in conclusion I believe that you can not force kids to do community service if they do not want to. Unless they were being punished for a instance ware littering was involved. So please do not make them do it, its against the constitution and the bill of rights.
