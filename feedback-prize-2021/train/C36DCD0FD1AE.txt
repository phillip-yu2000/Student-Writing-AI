By limiting the use of car usage the world can become a better place. The environment is cleaner, and people can become more healthy.

The gasses that are emmited from cars are very harmful to the environment and can cause serious problems. these gasses get stuck in the in the amostphere, which causes problems like smog in cities. in paris one day they enforced a partial ban on driving because of record breaking pollution the day before. This ban was 2 days and they finned all people with even number license plates. the next day they did the same to odd number license plates. Not only did pollution go down but also "congestion went down 60 percent,"(Duffer).

People are also effected in diferent ways if there was less car usage. People could get more exercise because they are walking more than they are driving. People are also more healthy because of the reduced aamount of pollution. One day a year in Bagota, Colombia people do not drive unless its a buisness or taxi. They say that this has helped people to become more active in outdoor activities. "Parks and sport centers have bloomed" (Selsky), in the city since this started 3 years ago.

the world could become a better place in the near future if the usage of cars is limmited. The environment could be cleaner, and everyone could become more healthy.
