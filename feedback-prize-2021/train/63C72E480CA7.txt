I need a car! why wont you get me a car? all of my friends have cars but me, why won't you get me a car! I scream at my mother almost everyday, trying to inform her of buying me a car, but she always change the subject by saying,"look at this population, look at all these people briving, we dont need one more trying to distroy are cities". I always ues to think in my head what is this lady talkng about, I only asked for a car. But as I start to look into life i start to understand that the most importanat things are sometimes the things that effect us the most, like for exmaple a car...

To begin with, in source 1, it states that passnger cars are responible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car- intensive areas in the Untied State. It also states in source 4 that, Amercia passed peak driving. Now if us Americans could limit driving everday and pick up are bicycles now and then, I belive problems like tracffic jams, and car accidents would be less. I also belive that the air we breath would be much more better for us. In source 3, it says that millions of colombians hiked, skated or took buses to work and doing this lefted the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. Mr. Goldberg, said in source 1 that, "how much you drive is as important as wheather you have a hybird, I put this in my essay because I feel as if, Mr. goldberg is saying that cars are like a burrden and that sometimes putting then bown wont hurt. Like for example one time my mother asked me to go out with her and i said yes, and as we are leaving the house i see that she lefted her car keys so I, took them for her and when we was out side i told her how are we supose to get in the car if you dont have your key? and she said " we are walking" I had a smile on my faces to know that my mother was trying to make a biffrents.
