I think you should not keep the Electoral College. We as people, should be able to pick who we want. The Electoral College keeps us from doing so. They are choosing for us that's not fair.

In source 3, it says that Gore had the popular votes, but Bush had the electoral votes so he won. If presidency was given to Gore it would be fair. We lost a chance to have a different president.

With the Electoral College all we are doing is voting the slate of electors, and they are voting for the president. We should be the ones who actually vote. Some of us, people forget the Electoral College and think we are the ones voting in reality we are the popular votes which dosent count as much as electoral votes. It should be the opposite.

In conclusion, we should get rid of the Electoral College, and let the people vote for they would like to vote for. We should not have someone vote for us, that's really all the Electoral College is doing.
