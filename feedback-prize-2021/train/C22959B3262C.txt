Students should have a summer project created by their teacher. Some students may not be able to come up with a idea for their project due to the lack of focus because summer has finally arrived. Students get things done quick and easy when the teachers design things because the students have the teacher directions on how to complete the assignment. When i was in middle school me, and majority of my classmates couldn't complete the summer project given from our teacher because it was student designed, and throughout that whole summer we coudn't complete and put in effort to the project because we could not think of anything, and also it was also summer at that time. The project should be teacher-designed so the students wont have a hard time completing the project and majority of students will have the project done.

Students will possibly get the project done quick because they will recieve good directions given from the teacher on the teacher-designed project. Some of the students may want to do a student-designed project because they feel that they will get it done in time and have came up with an idea. Why would some of the students choose student-design when some of the students may get it done but not all? students should choose teacher-designed so they wont have to struggle coming up with an idea for their project. so instead they can get get their project done quick and easy because their teacher gave them directions. The teacher would want all of his students to complete the project and also have a good summer so therefore i would choose teacher-designed. Students either that same week or that next week get the project done the month you received it so you wont have to worry about it later on in the summer.
