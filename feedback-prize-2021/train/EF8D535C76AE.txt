It would help to ask other people for advice but it helps when there's more than 1 person giving you advice. Each opinion can help you simplify your question. For example if you ask one person what they think you should do but you dont like their answer someone else could help cut down what you think feels right and wrong that could help you decide. When you ask other people for advice some times you can feel relieved and for some reason you dont feel like you are alone anymore and you don't have to worry as much as you used to. For example if someone were to be suicidal asking someone for help can make you feel relieved that there is a way to help that person. If you have more than one choice but you don't seem to like some of them you can ask a friend or a parent/guardian for some help on what to do. For example if I could choose to get a pet or not maybe someone has a pet and they could tell me the responsibility and cost of taking care of a pet. Maybe someone has experience that you don't so maybe it would be best asking for advice from someone who is more experienced. For example if I wanted to start getting more muscle I would ask someone I know that has been doing it for a long time to help me get more muscle by teaching me what to eat and what to not eat and what to do and how. One of the most important thing before you ask advice from the person is do you believe that he/her will not lie because if he/she gives you bad advice then you can make a very wrong decision thats why you need to be able to trust the person giving you advice.
