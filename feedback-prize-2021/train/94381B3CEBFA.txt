Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm writing this letter to you because

I care about our environment and I think all student should participate on community service. It will help us to be clean, to not litter, and recycle. If you put us to do community service it will teach us a lesson and we will care an take care of our environment.

You can put some schools to participate clean the streets during or after school. Every time someone try's to litter change there mind an actually go through it in the trash. Every time someone go to walking they see the streets clean and help them realizes that if they doing something to hurt the environment to stop doing it an to help there city. I think the city need to be more clean and to everyone help us recycle.

Sometimes people think that doing community service its a wastes of time, other think they don't care if the city is clean or dirty they only care about them and no-one else. They may think about other stuff that's supposedly more important then helping or doing community service. :
