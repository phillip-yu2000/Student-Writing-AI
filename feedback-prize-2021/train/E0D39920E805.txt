Smartphones are one of the best inventions of all time you can almost do anything you need or want on one. Sometimes people are so into these smartphones that they don't pay attention to their surroundings especially if you are using them while driving. Using your phone while driving is not and will never be safe. Not even at stop lights because if you aren't paying attention to your surroundings you can ruin the experience for others by not going when you are supposed to.

If you are anything like me, you like to use your phone a lot and you spend hours on it daily. That's completely fine but if you are using your phone to change a song, check Instagram, etc. While driving you aren't paying attention to what's going on around you and you can hurt yourself or others with you. Phones should never be used when driving it's dangerous not even just for you or the other people in the car but also the people around. If you aren't aware of what is going on around you can crash into another vehicle and you might end up being fine but then they end up dead and it would be your fault and you would get charged with vehicular manslaughter. Respect the law they are in place to protect people from reckless stuff like this.

There are laws in place in order to stop people from using their phones while driving so that they can keep people safe. If people followed the law like they were supposed to accidents wouldn't happen as much as they do now a day. Now I do understand if you absolutely must call someone like the cops or if your wife is having your child if it is absolutely necessaire use the phone as much as you'd like. If the situation you are in isn't urgent then you shouldn't be driving and texting or on the phone checking social media or watching videos you need to watch the road.
