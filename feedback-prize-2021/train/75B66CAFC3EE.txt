Do you ask people for advice? Asking different people for advice can help you see from multiple points of views, some times we talk to more than one person. having different opinions can help yourself make a better choice than an horrible choice.

I think everybody should ask for advice and give advice. A lot of people should be nice enough to give advice and those people reciving the advice should listen very carefully to them, getting advice could be helpful. If your a kid reciving advice from an grown up you should most definitly listen because an adult know more than what we know so yaÃÂ´ll should listen carefully.

Having multipl opinions is good because if one doesnÃÂ´t go as plan than you can have several to fall back on instead of having just one when you can having several more to follow to. Everybody is going to need advice at some in time maybe not now but later you are going to need it. Taking advice will not be as easy as it seems, some times it may be easy other times it may be hard taking it in.
