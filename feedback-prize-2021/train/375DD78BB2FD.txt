Dear principal,

It has come to my attention that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. You are considering two policies. The first one states that you will allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Policy two states that you will not allow students to have phones at school at all. I am for policy one because what if there is an emergency and students need their cell phones, also what if someone forgot their basketball uniform and they have a game then they can call home and ask for their parent or guardian to drop it off at school for them, and what if a kid needed his or her parent to pick them up from school because they were at an after school activity.

Firstly, I like the idea of policy one because students can call home if there is an emergency at school. What if someone broke into the school, then if the student has their phone handy they can call 911. Or what if there was a evacuation because their is a gas leak in the school. Then the student would have to call someone to pick them up.

Secondly, what if a student had a basketball or soccer game and they forgot their uniform? At free time the student can call someone to drop off their uniform. Say someone forgot their science book. Same thing the student would call someone at free time to drop off their science book.

Lastly, what if a student needed to call someone to pick them up after school because he or she just remembered that they have an after school activity? Then during free time the student call someone to pick him or her up. This would be really helpful to students.

As you can see I like the idea of policy one because I think it is more helpful to students and teachers. If you forget something at home you can call your parent to get
