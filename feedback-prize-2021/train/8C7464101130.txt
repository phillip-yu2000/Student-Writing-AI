I believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because students would try to hide their emotions. Students would probably be going through some tough times in their life, and they need some help but they are to scared to say it to an adult. The teacher might no be interesting to them. Teachers want to know on how to get all the students attention in class and do their work. This technology will be useful for teachers to be more interesting, seeing what makes the students happy, and helping a problem in their life that needs to be fix.

Let's say Alex is a student and is having a hard time at home because of their parents arguing every single time, being scared that they might one day not be together. The Facial Action Coding System will help an adult figure out what's making his emotion change and becoming sad. It will get an adult attention to talk to his parents and fix thing out. It can make you be even happier in the article it says " If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow". It can help you if your depress in the article it says " But if you frown, the next ad will be different".

In conclusion The Facial Action Coding System is useful to reading the emotional expression of students, or photos of someone that lived long ago and figuring out how they lived, and seeing what emotions they were having in the old days. It helps seeing how the people were treated during those days we wern't alive, and adding new history.
