Dear Principal,

Other students, including me, would like to request that we do not want to have at least a grade B average just so we can participate in sports or other activities. We say that its not right to make a policy change, the way the policy is right now is just great, but the only suggestion is, to not make that new policy, for not all of us have the grades and we do not want it or need it. If the reason for changing the policy, is because of our C averages and below, is the problem, well there can be other kinds, and different arrangements. For an example, lunch tutoring, or after school tutoring can be the solution but by taking away our activities and sports just because we need more B averages, isn't the proper way. We need to have theses activities and sports so we can be more active and healthy. So I'd consider announcing some other better way to changing the policy before students start arguing and denying it. I, myself, the students and teachers of this school agree to this letter and if its possible we would actually consider this. Its a big deal to us and thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

From,

your students and teachers of this school.
