First of all,we don't need these cars because they seem dangerous and not safe to the our envirnment,and now knowing that there going to build these car are going to take a lot more money from our government and they will cost way to much just for a car that can drive itself, like why would we need these cars? See in paragraph 9 it states that the driveless cars are illegal in California,Nevada,Florida,and the District of Columbia.

Second of all, I wouldn't buy this car because of the new technology that it has and what if the wires start glitching and you crash and you die? Who's fault would it be if that had happened? The driverless car sounds cool and all but you really got to think about the defects in the car and how it effects the car runs and how it will cost to get its oil changes and how much the check ups will cost. See Toyota is a good car company but in the past some of there cars killed a lot of people and the airbags didn't work. The same ccompany is going to make more,more new car to get more money.

Third, see in paragraph 9 it states," If the technology fails and someone is injured,who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? Thats the number 1 reason why I wouldn't buy this car is because of that question "Who's fault is it"? Whos fault is..... who fault it is, is the person who bought the car ans the person whol designed and built it, thats who fault it is.

In conclusion, the reason I wouldn't buy this car is because of the self driver and that doesn't seem to safe and it will cost way to much for that person and because of the that question "whos at fault".
