Dear State Senator, I am writing to you because I feel that we should abolish the Electoral College. The Electoral College swipes away the meaningness to choosing a president. A nation does not need to rely on a slate of voters to make desicions for us, as an independent induvidual I know that this country should follow the moral laws of which it was founded upon.

With a system like the Electoral College in place, voting becomes pointless. People vote because they feel like part of something bigger, having a slate of electors decide for you takes away the self pride that comes from voting. As mentioned in source number one

What Is the Electoral College?

in the 2000 election the president that won popular vote (Al Gore) lost the election because the Electoral College had the majoraty voting for George W. Bush. The Electoral College takes away the individuals voice.

The College does however provide a reliable service. For instance if there were to be a tie in popular votes, the College's vote would balace it. Still, the downsides of the Electoral College outweigh the benifits. As said in source number two "We need to abolish the electoral college".
