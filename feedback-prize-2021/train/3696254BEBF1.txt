I had no idea that my life would soon chsnge after high school graduation. I was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank. Until one day, my friend, Don Reist, told me to come with him to Europe. When we were in Europe I found my dream job. Here's what I did.

If you love adventure and fun, than you would love to be a Seagoing Cowboy. A Seagoing Cowboy is a person who helps and takes care of animals on ships that are being transported. As a Seagoing Cowboy, you see stuff that byou will never forget. If you are thinking "What if we have no fun.", you are totally wrong. You play sports, you read and your crew mates will become best friends with you.

If you also like animals, as a Seagog Cowboy, you really spend most of your time with the animals on the ship. I, Luke Bomberger, has been a Seagoing Coboy for the longest time. I have enjoed every second of it. Eveyone is super nice to me. This job changed my entire life.

As a Seagoing Cowboy, was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up another world for me. I have been more aware of my surrondings. And that awareness has stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many many years. I hope that one day, you will follow our dreams like I did.
