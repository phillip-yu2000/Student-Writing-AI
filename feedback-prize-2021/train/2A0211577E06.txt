When I was little I remember always watching these films about super hero and their really cool cars that would drive themselves. Well, although many take a certain side when it comes to for and against these driverless care, rarely do any think about what it would do to help society and improve or technology.

Our knowledge of technology has completely changed the way we design, make, and see new products. In 2009, Google reinvented the way humans look at cars. Independently run cars have come to the attention for the United States today.

We, as humans are particularly biased when it comes to not having to do something. In this sense, Americans are blind to the negative effect these driverless cars have. Driverless cars are a way for Americans to get out of taking time to drive somewhere, making them completely lazy. Cars like these are a hazard to the community and to the lives of many.

It is stated in a recent article that came out called "Driverless Cars Are Coming", that "there cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"(2). This is their job, to influence you to think that the new and improved cars that they have invented, are good for society. The article given to the side a measuring scale, that's all it is. To see how far technology has come along but even more so seeing how much we could improve.

A driverless car is just bad new at this point. Without it being fully developed and driverless I fear that we would start experiencing more and more tragedies. The danger hazards of a driverless car are off the charts.

Before we start thinking about selling these Google invited driverless cars, we should work out all the kinks and bruises that could easily turn the new technology in to a bad thing.
