Dear Principal

You have brought to mind a very good policy.

I aruge with you that students should have good grades to be in school activities .

One reason i aruge with you is that grades are very important what parent what there what there child getting bad grades i know my parents won't want that student should work there hardest for something they what in that mean getting good grades to be in the sports they want to be in .

My second reason is that having activities would want a student to work hard because having a soccer sport .Can mean good grades having something they what and not have bad grades and it also help .Keeps kids off the street not getting in to trouble .Activities are very important in a child life they have something to motive them .

My last reason why i aruge with the principal is that good grades mean good test scores and good test scores mean a performing plus school .Not just that it means we have one more child that won't be left back .
