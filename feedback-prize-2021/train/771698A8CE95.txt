I think this policy change is not a good idea a lot of students cannot maintain a

B average a lot of students don't try hard enough an are good at these activities the school has to offer for students who have ok grades to me i think that a c average is the lowest average that could be accepted an a B average might be to high for there to be any team for the school.

I also have another side on this story to i have seen students from sport teams have multiple D's and sometimes E's still be able to stay on the sports teams and the school has no argument to grades if the student is good at the sport activities to me it does not matter because the school might let the good students play not matter there grade average and let them get away with it.

So on this i think a c average is a average that the principal should consider an if he or she dose not either way don let the good players get away with it.
