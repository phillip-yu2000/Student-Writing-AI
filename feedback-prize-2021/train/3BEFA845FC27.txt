There are people all around the world that makes different varity of cars but theres nothing like driverless cars. Driverless cars are negitive, in my opinion. They'll keeps you secure, make sure your observing the road at all times, and the seats even vibrate when the vehicle is in danger but drivers must be alert and ready if the car is in any type of situation. Thes variaty of cars can be useful for those who have trouble keeping their eyes on the road. There are multiple reasons why driverless cars are useful but could be also negitive vehicles to us. Just keep reading to find out why.

All the driverless cars sounds so good and cool to us but most people would buy them because of what they and what they could do for them. Even though these cars came watch out for us and have vibrating seats and designed to do work and things like that but what if the car colaps? Anything can break and some things cant be fixed. Just imagine youre driving this new car and boom! it stops. You might think you need gas or oil change but really, everything broke down. Nothing is working the way you bought it. Youre going to need a new car.

These type of cars arent even good for a first time driver. If the car is doing everything for them then they're not gong to learn anything. Driverless brake by themselve, thats one important thing a first time driver needs to know. If theres only cars like this in the world with no regular cars, then i honestly think all of our cars are not going to make it.

Accidents inside the car can also be a problem. Lets say we have children and they get to the front seat with juice in their hand with no lid. Juice is going to get everywhere and there's going to be a big mess. Juice gets into the sterio or or where to start the car up at theres no more driverless car anymore.

This car has camera on its rearveiw mirror, four automotive rador sensors. Your just better off with a regular car. Saves parents money and a whole lot of attitude.
