Creating a world with driverless cars would "fundamentally change the world". The use of driverless cars is proven to be safe and helpful to not only the driver and passangers, but also to pedestrians.

In my opinion driverless cars will be very safe, these cars of the future have sensors to "detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers". The sensors have "far better response and better control than a human driver could manange alone", with the help of the sensors drivers will be more alert and less prone to have accidents. Google cars "have driven more then half a million miles without a crash". These results show that these cars are very safe.

Allthough this car of the future can drive itself, it will still need a driver to "remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires", in case of any emergency. The Google car will announce when the driver should be prepared to take over, some manufacturers want to display some form of entertainment with a "heads-up display". With the entertainment having alerts there will be less texting and driving.

In conclusion Driverless cars are a very smart, reliable and a safe decision. In the future there will be less accidents, because alot of drivers will have other entertainment to distract them, this entertainment will have car alerts to warn them of any uprising danger. This car of the future will change alot of lives for the better, with all the helpful and safety adjustments that were created.
