There are many reasons why others should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. They will experience unique adventures, beautiful countries and cities, and will have the chance to care for and grow closer to God's magnificent animals, like I did.

The first reason to sign up for this program is that they will experience unique adventures. These may include meeting new friends, trying new foods from different culters, spending weeks on the bright blue sea, and roaming around new places. I had a great time seeing and doing all of those things while I was a Seagoing Cowboy.

Another reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy is the ability to discover beautiful new countries and cities. They could see mysterious English castles, eat delicious European foods,sail across long, flowing rivers through France, smell many different plants and animals in Asia,

and much more! It would be an experience of a lifetime and all their friends back home would be jealous of their trips.

Last but certainly not least, the new Seagoing Cowboys would have the chance to work with amazing animals! If they love hard-working animals like these, this job is for them. They get to take care and feed these magnificent animals such as horses, cows, donkeys, and mules that would be taken to the countries that are in need which they would be headed to. They can have fun and help others at the same time!

In conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy would be tons of fun and knowledgeable, too. I would definitly recomend it. They would have a blast experiencing unique adventures, sightseeing in beautiful countries and cities, and caring for the wonderful animals God put on this earth for us.
