Driverless care i think would be lack of motivation, and could cause lazyness. People around the world would want a driverless car, well because they're not driving it. The computer is, it would probably be another episode of WALL-E where everybody gets fat because our technology is to adavanced. If this situation comes in to play, who knows what would be next. If they started to release these smart cars, would that mean that everybody would have to own one? Since they're so safe. I do not think they should have these smart cars put into play, because it would just change the world, maybe in a good or a bad way, but whos willing to take the chance? The cars would probably cost millions also, with the technololgy that is inside the cars, say the smart cars d crash, would they still have them riding around on the streets?

dont really think so. But to the point, if they were to put these cars on the market, it cost people and companies millions, just start a conflict with the world. I dont think its a good idea.
