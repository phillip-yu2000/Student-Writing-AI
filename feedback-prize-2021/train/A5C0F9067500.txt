Dear Senator,

I think you need to change it to where the election goes by popular vote for the president of the United States. It's not fair to have electoral college. The people that have to obide by the president should be able too choose who thier president is. I can see where people like the electoral college because the electors get to choose and it has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes. I also don't like the fact that all of the states get a different amount of electoral votes. Claifornia gets the most amount of electoral votes, it gets 55. But there are a few states that only get three or four. All of the states should get an equal amout of votes, We are the 'United' states, arnt we?

The idea of the common adult (over the age of 18) being able to vote is a good way to let us keep our say in things, especially if we get to choose who the president is going to be. Once again, I think you should change it to popular vote for the president of the United States.
