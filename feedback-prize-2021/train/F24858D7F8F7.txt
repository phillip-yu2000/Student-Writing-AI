Drivers should be able to use phones while driving. Even though texting while driving is against the law people have invented apps and devices that allows you to use the phone without actually holding the phone in your hand they have phone holders and aux cables.

Even if your not allowed to hold your phone while driving to change the music or change the call you can now use an aux or voice activated command like siri or alexa. Which would make it safer to use your phone while driving and not having to your phone

Most people nowadays still drive while texting on the phone I know my older brother and my God dad do it all the time. I sometimes wonder if im supposed to say something about them driving while on the phone.

Using phones while in the car can be a good thing in the since that in case of emergency and you aren't able to reach your phone with your hand you can use voice activation to call the police or fire department. See most people don't take advantage of phone holders while driving because its an hasil to hook to the air vent but if it's going to keep me out of jail I would use one. So in the end cell phones should be allowed to be used in any capacity while operating any vehicle.
