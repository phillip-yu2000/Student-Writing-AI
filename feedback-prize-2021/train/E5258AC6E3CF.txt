The author explains in the article that Venus is worth of studying despite the dangers because it is the closest to Earths conditions as in land but the atmosphere is dangerous. In the article the author explains that Venus is "like Earths twin." With the attempts to study the planet itself the spaceships and rovers they send do not even last a day let alone a few hours. The atomsphere is very dense with carbon dioxide which burns the spacecraft before it even touches down. Then the ship has to go through the clouds which are almost pure sulfuric acid which corrods away at the already burnt spacecraft. The study is to see what it would take for people to live on that planet. The people who attempt to live there would need a way to survive almost instantly deadly temperatures of 800 degrees fahrenhite and atomospheric pressure 90 times heavier than Earths. The investigation shows that with that kind of pressure will crush a submarine that could go to the deepest part of the oceans and would liquify almost any metal put on the surface. All in all the benefits of the study would show what needs to be done to make the planet habitable even though the dangers of the study is somewhat high.
