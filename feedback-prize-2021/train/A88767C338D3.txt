Texting and Driving

Phones in cars have been a problem ever since they were first introduced in 1946. Over

1.6 million people die each year from texting and driving. Texting while driving, or touching your phone at all, is now completely illegal in Georgia. This helps the death rate each year go down, but many people in Georgia still use their phones while driving. In addition to this many states, other than Georgia, don't outlaw texting and driving. All states should make it illegal to text while drive, in addition to touching or supporting a hand held device while driving.

On February twenty-second, 2018 Camryn Callaway, know as "Cici" to all her friends died in a fatal car crash. Camryn had plowed into the back of an eighteen wheeler on I-65 late that night and died. Police later determined that Camryn had been texting and driving. Incidents like these are heartbreaking and are the reason that texting and driving is illegal. Most people, people just like Camryn, Probably think to themselves "that could never happen to me." The sad truth is that one way or another, eventually, texting and driving will catch up with you. Whether that be the blue lights or death itself, the choice is yours.
