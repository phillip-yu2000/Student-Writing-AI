Many people use cars every single day. Whether it's to go to school, work, a friends, to the store, or even go to an after school activity. A lot of people in other countries such as germany and Paris have given up their cars or vehicles completely.

First off, places have taken away the ability to park. "street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district"(S1P2). This quote shows that they have taken away the right to park in certain places. "there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"(S1P2). This quote shows how they are limiting areas to park so not many people buy cars.

Second off, Motorized vehicles are causing a lot of smog. "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog"(S2P14). This quote shows that the smog is building up because of cars. "motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine"(S2P11). This quote shows that they weren't kidding about no more cars. The cars were causing harm to the beautiful city.

A lot of places today are getting rid of cars. Without cars they can get the natural beauty of the city back instead of it being smokey and gross all day. Eventually it will be like that, but this is a hard transition for people who drive to work or go to school. Its a big change that some places in the world are willing to take.
