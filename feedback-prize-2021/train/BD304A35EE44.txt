There are many advantages of limiting car usage. The ways they are limited are not driving your car everywhere you go, not having your car at all and just ride the bus or bike.

In Source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars many people live n Freiburg near France dose not have a cars the reason being in paragraph two its states "Vaubsan's street are completely "car-free" except the main throughtfare, where the tram to downtwon Freiburg runs, and a few streets on edge of the community." This quote indicates thats people from Freiburg did not have a cars or they didn't use them.

Some may say that having a cars free day is a good thing according to Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. In that source in paragragh twenty four Carlos Arturo Plaza made a great point which reads "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution." This shows limiting car usage you can lower air pollution which helping the enviroment.

Also in Source 2: Paris bans driving dur to smog in paragraph ten. Which states "After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." Which shows limting car usage can lower air pollion, which was shown in Source 3.

To Conclude, Limiting car usage can be tought from someone who drives there car all the time. But if people really see what there doing when they limit there car usage they would be helping the enviroment. In all of the sources made valid points on the advatages of limiting car use.
