In the 1950s, automakers started to develop what was to become one of the first steps toward creating a driverless car and made a car that could run itself on a special test track. Then, in the 1980s, automakers everywhere started using speed sensors. These were the things that began the advancement of the driverless car. The driverless car can now detect and respond to danger; steer, accelerate, and brake itself; and is predicted to use less fuel and offer more flexibility which makes it the ideal car to have.

The sensors that the automakers in the 1980s used have advanced greatly and is able to detct and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids and rollovers. These advanced sensors can also apply brakes to individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, avoiding danger much more successfully than a human driver could manage alone. This also saves expenses on wrecks and is a lot more safe for the driver.

The driverless car can also steer, accelerate, and brake itself. Some can even warn the driver when they are in danger of backing into an object, though all are designed to notify them when confronting obstacles that require human skills such as navigating around work zones and accidents. Even so, the driverless car can largely manage manage things on its own.

The driverless car, if its also converted to a public-transport taxi system, is predicted to use half the fuel today's taxis do and also offer more flexibility than a bus. This public-transport taxi system could also put an end to the world's need to buy cars, also saving the population money on car expenses.

So, in conclusion, the driverless car can save people money on car and accident expenses, reduce the risk of accidents, and save fuel, which can be better used elsewhere. Driverless cars are definitely something worth developing because who wouldn't want extra cash and lower risks of accidents?
