Dear Principle,

I think policy 2 is the best one because students shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones at school it take your whole focus off of school. When you are in class in your phone is on and one of your friends text you , you are going to stop what you are doing just to look at that text message you are taking your mind off of the lesson in class. Phones can also be a detraction to others, if you forgot to put your phone on vibrate and the ringer go off in class the teacher would have to stop the class and take up your phone and the students will be looking at you. Phones can get you in a lot of trouble like taking a serious test and if you get caught with it you can fail or be retained in that same grade, phones should be banned or taking up for the school hours. Most students be to concern about their phone that they'll fail , and phones can also start a lot of trouble you can start a rumor at school about someone just by sending a text message to one of your friends. When you can't use phones at school it can prevent a whole bunch of mess from happen at school , you wont get in much trouble with your parents because you did not want to give the teacher your phone when you shouldn't have brought it to school in the first place , save you time from going to in house school suspension , or getting a ticket.

When you have a phone its a big responsible when you are at school and a kid see you with that phone and they want it you might not have a phone for awhile because they might steal it , that's why students shouldn't be able to bring a phone to school to many things can happen just because a cell phone you should but it away until after school during school hours you shouldn't have you cell phone out at all not even at lunch or while you going to your other periods phones should be banned and keep in your backpack powered off. You should have it for emergency only if anything that's really what they are for not
