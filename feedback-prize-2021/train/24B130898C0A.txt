Dear Ms. Principal,

In regards to the change in rules, which state that students must maintain a B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities, I agree with you 100%! Enforcing this law will help to push the students to keep up their grades. School was made for kids to learn and if they decide to slack off for sports I believe they should not be handed the privilege of such activities. If they would like to be in these activities well then they should try to keep a focus on school and then be given the privilege.

Maintaining a B average should not be so difficult for students, with a little effort and concentration anything can be accomplished. In addition, I would think that this rule would make students want to try harder in school and be able to achieve a B or higher grade average. For example, if a C average student would like to participate in a specific sport then he/she will have to give more effort to getting a B average and being given the ability to participate in this specific sport. I believe this rule will help many students to achieve educational goals and put their knowledge to the test.

Lastly, I agree with the rule that is now being enforced and I believe it will help the school's students to participate and concentrate more in class. This rule will teach students that being able to participate in sports and other school activities is a privilege and to earn a privilege they must work hard. I believe this was a well thought out rule and should be enforced in other schools as well. This rule will help the school and its students to get a better feeling for privileges and the way to earn them.
