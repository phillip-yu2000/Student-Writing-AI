Dear principal,

As you may have well known, there has been much debate upon the fact whether students are required to perform community service to provide benefits towards our community.

I think we should be required to provide community service even if it takes up some of our time, because I would think that helping the community has more a reason than doing something for ourselves, for example people say that their family is the most important thing in there life, i agree, this relates to this, because our community is our family and helping it is like helping yourself and a lot of other people.

Just doing something that isn't doing something that isn't community service, I think, is just doing for yourself, for example playing video games, it just brings entertainment to yourself and for something to have meaning it needs to help one or several people.

I also think community service is a benefit to our community, because when people see us, they would be influenced to help out, bring more people to help out would not only bring benefits to our community but also to the world.

Make Earth a healthier environment for us to live in.

As you may think this impossible, it actually is not, because at first what may seems like a duodecimo group of people in a few days these people will influence thousands maybe millions of people.

Very few people realized what a simple thing can do people, that is why some of my friends and students don't agree with me about doing community service.

Influencing you to be on our side is a big deal, because since you have power over our school you might be able to influence a lot of people, including students, teachers, and parents. With your help, we have a good chance to make our community improve. I hope you thought over my letter.

Thanks,
