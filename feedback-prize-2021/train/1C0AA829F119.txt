I would keep the electoral college because its seems to be working well. And if we changethe electoral college everything would work differently. And a big change like this would make alot of people mad and upset and posibaly riot.

The electoral college is really not a college its a constitution as a compromise between election of the president. Electoral college consists of 538 electors. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors.

Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for the slate of electors. The single best argument againest the electoral college is what we might call the disastor factor. During the 200 campaign,seventeen states didnt see the candidtes at all .

The eletoral college sould stay because not all changes are bad but this one will be. The united states needs too stop making changes because its costing not the government but the people. If the debat about changing the electol college gets out of hand, people will start rioting and alot of people will be protesting.
