Dear Principal,

I would very greatly consider policy #1. Students should be allowed to use their cell phones in school. If there is an emergency at home and no one can come to the school to get the student, someone could call their cell phone. It would also be better because students could talk to their friends from different classrooms if they didn't have a hall pass.

If students could use their phones they could go home with friends if they didn't have a ride home. The student could text their parents and tell them to call the school for permission to ride home with a friend. The student could also text or call their friend to ask if they could go home with them.

The only bad part in policy #1 is that phones should be turned of during class time. Phones should be on during class so the student could use it during an emergency. Even some of the teachers have their phones turned on during class. If the teachers can have their phones on then the students should have their phones on too.

There are many reasons for phones being allowed in school and these are some of those reasons.
