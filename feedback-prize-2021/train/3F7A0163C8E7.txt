Hi, i have heard about the community service problem and believe that community service could be done at school.

The way think this should work is when students miss behave they are sent to ISS. Well when their are in ISS and done with their assignments then they should be sent monitored outside the school building and clean up all the trash this way they will think before they miss behave this will also be helping the community. Another way this could work is by providing a community service class to all of those who wish to help in community service. Also the school can add an after school program in witch students are allowed to stay after school and clean up the school and communities that surround the area .I also think that in order to help this problem the principles should set up a meeting with all of the students and explain to them the importance if having a clean community. This way student might start to like the process and get involved in helping keep the community clean. I hope my ideas help in someway.
