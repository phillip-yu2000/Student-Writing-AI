In the year 2018 technology is advancing as well as schools all around the world. Most kids roll their eyes or yawn or even have a bored/tired look on their face when they're in a classroom that hey dont enjoy. With new technology called FACS(Facial Action Coding System), it will be able to detect when kids are feeling this way.

The computer makes a 3-D model face of a human and have all 44 major musles that operates like human musles, then it scans the face of a real human which will then identify what the person is feeling right now such as happy, sad, tired, scared and many more. Using this type of technology will be very helpful in classrooms because when a student is feeling bored or tired then the computer will be able to detect that the the teacher will be able to make the topic more interesting for the students. Most teachers have about 28 students per class for seven periods everyday which can be very stressful, so it can be very challenging for them to recognize when students are dealing with a certain type of emotion but with the FACS it can recognize that and the teacher will be able to help the student or students.

In conclusion, FACS is an amazing creation that will be able to help students and teachers. Kids learn the most when they're happy and when the subject they're learning is fun and very interesting and when they're in a good environment. With FACS, it not only detects a humans emotion but it will be able to communicate with a teacher to notify them when a kid is not doing well.
