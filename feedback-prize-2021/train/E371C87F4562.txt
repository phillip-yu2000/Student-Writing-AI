My name is Luke Bomberger and I am going to tell you some cool things you get to do and see if you become a Seagoing Cowboy. First you will get to see animals that live in the sea such as dolphins, whales, and maybe a shark. One things that really gets me excited about being a Seagoing Cowboy is when I get to hang out on a boat with animals like horses and cows. I think that you should join because you could see the Statue of Liberty, and you might get to meet some really interesting people. When you have droped off the animals you might get to stay a little while and explore the town or city.

If you join the program you would be helping others when they need it. You could marvel at the Panama Canal on your way somewhere just like I did. On your way back you could play games and have tournaments in games such as softball, baseball, and table tennis where the animals were stored.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you could be more aware of others and their needs. It made me grateful that I gave becoming a Seagoing Cowboy a chance and it changed my life.
