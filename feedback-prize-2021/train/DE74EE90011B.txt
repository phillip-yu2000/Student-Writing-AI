We should not as the students of this school have to make that good of a grade to be able to play sports and play stuff we like. If we have to make a B average and a lot of kids don't make that then we wouldn't have sports then and we need them because of people getting fat and not wanting to do anything. Kids need to be in shape for life. Having these sports at school keeps a lot of kids out of getting in trouble with the cops and doing drugs and stuff that can hurt here body and life and it teaches them how to be nice and help others and be a team player. But it also teaches them respect. Respect is something u need to have to get something u want its good for life. So if u do that to our school that's like taking away our life and us being not fat and stuff like that we love playing sports at our school. All the teachers need to do is help more to get these kids to pass and maybe they can make something out of sports and they will come back later on in life and thank you for pushing them to pass school to be where they are right now.
