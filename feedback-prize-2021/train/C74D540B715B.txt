Principal,

So many students who go to school own a cell phone, and most students bring their cell phones everywhere with them-- including school. I personally think that allowing cell phones in school is a good idea if students are only allowed to use them during lunch or other free times. Cell phones are a good thing to have when you need to organize something, make an important call, email, etc.

Allowing phones in school is not something to think twice about.

Phones are important to have if a student needs to make an important call to family, friends, etc. If a student needs to make a call about an emergency or a personal issue during school that they do not feel the school should know about, then having a phone with you could solve that problem.

Phones are also a useful thing to have if a student needs to organize what they are doing after school with their parents/friends. Phones would also make it easier to contact someone if there was a change of plans which could disrupt schedule. Having a phone is an easy was to organize that kind of issue.

If a student has a phone with them, it would become useful if a student needs to contact a friend about a project or schoolwork during school hours. It would be a good way to organize the time they could use to complete--in this case-- a project they were doing together and the materials they would need to do so. I think that would be very helpful.

There are many good uses for a phone in school. The students would not misuse the phone either because they would only be allowed to use the phone during certain times. Having a phone in school would make it much easier for students to organize what they need to do with their peers, or contact family members during an important situation. Having a phone would make a big change in the school system. This would not be a bad change, it would be a good one.

Thank You,
