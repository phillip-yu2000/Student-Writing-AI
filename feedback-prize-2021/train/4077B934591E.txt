Personally,I'm not too thrilled about these developments. It isn't so much not wanting these cars to happen, but rather it's about what this development is. it has essentially just opened up another way to be lazy. While automaton cars aren't a bad thing in the least, their existence could begin a new era of trouble.

Obesity is a big problem, and let's face it, it's because of typical american diets just exaggerating the calories we don't burn because of how lazy the general population is. And on top of that, it still requires a manual driver, in case of something it doesnt recognize that needs to be maneuvered around. If a bad driver happened to be behind the wheel and such an event occured, disaster would surely follow. I don't mean to be, well, mean, but introducing a new car that can drive itself would have horrible backlash in the future, when the newest generations would know only the self driving cars.

What i'm saying is, while their intentions are good in trying to do this, some things are better left to manually do. Just because it's easier doesn't necessarily make it better. It just means you have to put out less effort.
