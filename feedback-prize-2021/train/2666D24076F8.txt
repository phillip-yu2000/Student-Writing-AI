About twenty five years ago, the Face was first discovered by Viking 2 while it was circling Mars taking pictures. NASA got the pictures and released them days after the mysterious rock was found. The Face settles in the region of Cydonia on Mars.

People think that the Face is created by aliens because the rock formation looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh; however, it is not. Arguements about the Face have been going on since the first picture was released. I'm here to tell you that the Face is 100% a natural landform.

When people argue about the miraculous rock formation, they say that there was or is life on Mars and that the aliens built the Face because it appears to have a mouth, nose, and eyes.

Some questions we get a lot are "How did it get there?", "Why does it have a human face?", and "How did it naturally get prominent face features of a human?" We do not 100% know how the Face got its human feature, but through all of the tests we have done on Mars, there are no aliens found and that the Face is just a fantasic natural made wonder of space.

When I get more informtion about the Face, I will certainally let you know!
