Do you ever feel like you should join a Seagoing Cowboys program? You should join the program because it helps the world, saves people and animals, and it good if you do join. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program and that you are helping many peoples lives and saving people to not run away and fight back.

First, it helps the world by in 1945 World War II, was being taken over by Europe and Europe made so many countries leave the ruins and it was just not right for people to move out of their countries. So 44 nations formed a group called the," UNRRA which meant (the United Nations Relief and Rehailitation Adminstration.) So I think it would help if more people joined and you could beat the Europe people who wanted to fight.

Then, save the people and animals by UNRRA had hired the "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the young cows, horses, and mules that had been shiped overseas. That is when Luke and Don had signed up. So after they had signed up in August 1945, they had got a orders to report to New Orleans. When Luke and Don arrived on August 14 Luke had said," The day the Pacific war ended." Everyone got their seaman's papers and boarded that had SS Charles W. Wooster, headed to Greece with a cargo of horses and enough hay to eat So I think that if more people sign up more animals and people will be saved.

Last, good for you to join Seagoing Cowboys program its good by saving peoples lives and animals lives and by keeping the countries save so people can be happy if you join. And that if you join you can be rewarded will a big surprise in the end of the war that is going on. So now I think that you should always think before youself and join.

In conclusion, you should always join to be happy for what you did and joining would help the Seagoing Cowboys program. So for last try to do something new and it will really pay off if you try new things.
