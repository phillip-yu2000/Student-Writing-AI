Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think cell phones should not be allowed in school for the following reasons. I think students would use them to text answers to a test for people about to take it. I also think that people would try to steal peoples cell phones because they have one that is better than theirs. Finally it could lead people to send threatening texts to people they don't like. Now to explain my reasoning.

Texting answers to a test would result people not learning any thing their teacher is telling them. I heard when texting first came out the FCAT was the same for everyone in the room so people could text the answers around the room and no one tries. Say some one had a Spanish test right before lunch and some one had it after lunch they could text the answers to the person and use their phone to get a good grade. That is why phones lead to cheating.

People steal each others phones because they want the latest and greatest. The turtling of someone's back pack could lead to people looking through their stuff finding a phone and taking it. At gym someone comes in late and goes to dress out and searches through backpack and steals anything of interest like phones. That is how phone can be stolen and why shouldn't be aloud on campus.

Bullying can be used to scare people over phones. I have seen people get beat up over texting stuff to people. Bullying over the phone can lead to fights and disputes between people. Bullying can also lead to people having really low self-as team. That is why phones can lead to bullying.

I have just explained how phones can lead to problems in school. Like how people can cheat on important tests. How people steal each others phones to be cool. Also how it can lead to people fighting and bullying. Now think clearly about what I just said make the right choice.

Think about it,
