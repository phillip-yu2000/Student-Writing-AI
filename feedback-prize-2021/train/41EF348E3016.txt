Phones and Driving

I think drivers should not be able to use their cellphone in any capacity while operating vehicle, for 2 reasons, one example when you're driving and using a cell phone while operating a vehicle you're not 100% paying attention on the road and that's already bringing danger to other drivers driving on that road when your texting you can forget that roads are shared with everyone. that can cause accidents and if an accident occurs because you was using your phone and not paying attention fully on the road that can get you in legal trouble and you can also pay a big fine for that accident, also your insurance bill is going to go up. Another example if you have passengers with you they can get harmed because of your mistake using a cellphone in a capacity while operating a vehicle. The driver will also experience a physical distraction by having to release the steering wheel to attend to the cell phone text messaging is really considered the most dangerous effect. In studies from scholarly authors, nowadays they have bluetooth text to prevent more accidents and its actually helping somehow. To many people dying to car accidents and have died due to an accident and sum of them were killed because some idiot decided to text and drive and risked others their lives, and that's not fair to the people.

So this is why I think People should not be driving a vehicle while operating a cellphone.
