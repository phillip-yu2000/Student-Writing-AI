School Grades:

I don't think that it is fair to have a B average just to play a sport. It should stay the way it is now, at a C average. It would be hard to have a B average if your a kid that struggles just to keep your C. Could you imagine what it would be like to try and make a B average? It would be a horrible struggle. C' s are passing grades, but I do understand that a B' s better. But some kids are happy with a C. They shouldn't change it to make higher grades, they should make it to where the kids that have more trouble with the school work can try and make it to a C. Because, in my school some of the kids that are amazing in there sport. Are not so good in school work. They struggle with the work they have to do. I know its not all about winning, but another thing is that if you made the higher demand and make it a B. Than most of those kids wont be on the team, and sometimes you need those kids to help your team. I would completely understand that if you had a D or F. And couldn't play on the sports team. Because D' s and F' s are failing grades. t. I would think about trying to make it a higher grade average, just a little more. And get the understanding that most of America's students are C average people. An that the sports teams would go down, as the grade average gets higher. Yes educations is better for you, and playing sports is a gift. But, lets say that we change it to a B average. An all the great players on the team have to quit or get taken off because of the grades. Than they can't play another sport. So they will start not caring about there body weight, so then they become obese. And that's another thing people in America are struggling with. Overall I don't think its a very good idea to make it a higher grade to play a sport.
