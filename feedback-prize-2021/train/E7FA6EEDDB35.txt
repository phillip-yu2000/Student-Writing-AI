You can help out like Luke Bomberger did is you join the war. You are putting your life in steak and you could possibly get hurt but you are helping out our people of the United States. Luke Bombergerthought that it was a little big for him only for a small town boy.

When Luke was a young man he worked two part time jobs and his friend offered him one of the part time jobs. Luke then helped out in the army for world war 2 and he was happy that he joined because he helped out people of his own kind. Now what i mean is that if you want to help out in fighting for our country go right ahead and help out like Luke. Luke had a lot of jobs and he had a great time in the jobs and he did them well and he loved his jobs. Luke did have a good life and he help a lot of people out so do the same with your life. You can help a lot of people when you can see that some one needs help it does not matter what you are doing just stop what it is and go help. You can make a good life doing that the people will appricate what you can do for them.

You can make a big change If you join the army you can still give us Justice.
