The Seagoing Cowboys program was I great, and I suggest that everyone try it. If you like animals this would be a good job for you, if you like sailing it would be a good job for you, and most of all is you need something to do and would enjoy sailing with animals this is the perfect thing for you.

To join the Seagoing cowboys you don't even have to be qualified, infact I didn't even know about it until my friend asked me if I wanted to come. My friend Don Reist invited my to travel to Europe on a cattle boat. So, really you don't need a big flashy degree or really anything at all to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you love animals you should become a Seagoing Cowboy. As a Seagoing Cowboy you get to spend a lot of time with a lot of animals. The day the Pacific war ended I set out on my first trip, which was to Greece with 335 horses, and if you like spending a lot of time with animals, it takes two weeks to cross the pacific, and to go to China it'll take a month. So, if you enjoy to spend time with animals you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to have a lot of fun and do a lot of site-seeing. As a Seagoing Cowboy I always found a way to have fun. We would have baseball and volleyball games, we would have table-tennis tournaments, fencing, we would even enjoy boxing, reading, and even whittling. And to top it all off we saw a lot of amazing sites. We would go all over Europe and China. I have personally visited Greece, China, seen the Panama Canal, and have even toured an excavated castle in Crete. Even though there might be long excruciating trips, we still find ways to have fun.

There are many upsides of being a Seagoing Cowboy. I have only told you a few of the many, many advantages of being a Seagoing Cowboy. So, after all of this I hope you consider joining me on the high seas.
