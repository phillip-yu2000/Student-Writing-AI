Phones & Driving

This is my essay on why people shouldn't drive and talk on the cellular device at the same time. People shouldn't drive and text or talk on the cellular device why I feel this way, well I feel this way because a lot of things can go wrong when driving and being on the cellular device. When driving you shouldn't be on your phone you should be focusing on the road because once you take your eyes off the road so many things can go wrong. You can cause an accident you can kill somebody all because you weren't paying attention. I think it should be against the law to drive and text while can end so many lives. I say if you must answer a call or a text you should pull over and answer is no need to answer it while you're on the road just to stay safe. To prevent accidents, you just shouldn't be on your phones you should pull over to the side and answer it.
