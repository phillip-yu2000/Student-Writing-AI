The use of this technololgy towards students in a classroom, I think it is a good idea. If teachers found out how we feel or our face expressions to show them how we are feeling that day. I feel like it's a great idea, that way teachers and staff know if they are having a bad day or are in need of help. Some students in school can be stressed even over homework in the classroom or at home. Reading students facial expression and there feelings is good for the students and teachers, because the teachers can help there students and they can be happy.

In paragraph 6, it quotes "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." If the computer can figure out the students feelings and emotions, I most certainly think it's a good idea to have the Facial Action Coding System. This system can help every student there is in a classroom by having teachers make them happy or help them with something that they are having trouble with. Some students can be very sad and upset that this system can save someone's life. Usually you can notice someone's not having a good day or is having a good day by looking at there face. No one can find out if they are really sad inside with a small smile on there face, nobody can find out if something happened to them and they're hiding it. But with that system, teachers would be able to find out what is wrong with there students.

In paragraph 4, it quotes "Each expression is compared against a neutral face." When it comes down to the Facial Action Coding System, that would find out whether or not the students face expression is being sad, angry, happy and etc. No matter what the students face expression is or looks like. I feel as if this system would be greatly used in school's. It can save kids lives and help each and every one in the school and classroom's.
