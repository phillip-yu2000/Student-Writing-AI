The authour feels venus could be alot like earth wich means extra resources that could expand our life. " Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." There are also things being done to help be safe while gaining information on venus. " Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." All of this has shown that there are still chances to get to venus, there are reasons to want to go there, and there are things you can do for saftey there. So i agree that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
