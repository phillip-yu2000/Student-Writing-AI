teacher-design Vs. Student-design

Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?. This is actually a very interesting prompt, in my opion i feel like students should come up with there own summer project ideas because it forces the students to stretch there brain an and do research to complete there summer project, which keeps the brain active because the students have to plan out and do the project.

I feel as tho assigning a summer project that you have to come up with is reasonable for example when i was in elementary school i never wanted to do the big packets of work because i felt like they gave to much work out for it to be a summer break, so i stop doing them but when i was sighed to do the stem science fair i always did them because i like the fact that i could work on something that interest me. Also students tend to want to work on stuff that is self-designed then something the teacher has made for them especially when it comes to a project plus its less stress on the teacher to come up with a projects for the whole class when its 30 student to a class room just let the students come up with it.

Another reason i prefer student design over teacher is because i feel like teachers find boring topics to give us projects on and if students have to do a project on there break they can at least let us pick what our project is based on. I use to think that giving work during the summer didnt make since but as i got older and higher grade in school i realized its only for the benefit of u so Ur brain can stay strong and wont forget that your still in school because not doing anything productive all summer then going back to school is stressful it makes me feel like im in Pre K all over again.

In conclusion im with student-design not just because im a student myself but because it benefits students it helps keep there brain strong while there on break, its interesting to them and students will more likely do this because they picked it then doing what the teacher chose for there project.
