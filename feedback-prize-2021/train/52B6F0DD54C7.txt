The advantages of limiting car use are you become less stressed, you have cleaner air, and decreases the amount of traffic jams.

First, limiting car use will lessen stress. for example, in the article Car-Free City a woman says, "when i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way." She is happier because she does not have a car. in the article "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota" it also says, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polution..." Having a car makes you more stressful.

Secondly, limiting car use helps the air be cleaner. For instance, in the passage "paris bans dring due to smog" by Robert Duffer it says,"after days of near-recod pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city." Cars pollute our air so putting bans on cars will freshen our air.

Thirdly, limitation on the use of cars will decrease the amount of traffic jams. for example, in the article "car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" it states that, "...leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of trffic jams." with out so many cars being on the road other forms of transportation jush as buses or trams have room them to drive and be on time.

In conclusion, limiting the amount of cars is a good idea. The advantages to limiting car use are that lessens the amount of stress, it provides cleaner air, and decreases traffic jams.
