Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. New phones are coming out so more and more people are buying phones. Almost all people that operate a vehicle have a cell phone. Drivers should not operate a cell phone while driving.

Drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Because texting and driving can lead to bad accidents. According to research last year over one million accidents happened in the united states in 2018. Texting and driving is very distracting to drivers on the road. Many states have made this illegal but all states need to crack down on this so the accidents will go down in the future.

Texting and driving can also lead to death. The rate of death is very high for texting and driving every year it causes up to half a million deaths. The death rate is so high because people are careless about being on their phone while driving. They risk the chance of hurting others because of their bad habits.

Texting and driving is very dangerous because it leads to bad accidents and deaths. Drivers should stop doing it and police need to crack down on drivers that do it. If this happens accidents while driving would dramatically decrease and deaths would decrease. Texting and driving should stop, and we can make that change.
