I think that if a child don't wanna do at least one extracurricular activity the child don't have to because of work,family,money, and maybe the child is just tried and wanna chill after school.

Family can take up a lot of time. If you have a brother's or sister's maybe even someone in your family is sick and you have to take care of them. Sometimes your mom and dad have to work. On top of going to school and making sure your grades are good so you'll be able to stay in your extracurricular activity. That takes a lot of time and after a while you'll get tried and that's not healthy.

Money can be a big reason why you can't do one. Most extracurricular activity cost a lot of money mostly sports. It can even be getting to where your suppose to go because some people don't have cars. Some people have to go to work depending on if what grade there in and there mom or dad have the money or not. extracurricular cost a lot of money that people don't have.

Sometimes work can get in the way of extracurricular activity. If your in high school depending or your age you might have a job. Taking time or showing up late to your job will hurt your pay check might even get fried. High school is not the only one that goes threw this all grades do most of the time people moms and dads have to work. That happened's to a lot of kids and Teens.

Lastly sometimes after a long day if school you might wanna go home and chill. School is a lot to handle on the mind. To class work, grades, and people sometimes a child don't even like to talk to people but there family. After doing studying,doing homework and taking test you'll get tried and dont wanna do anything else. That's a lot of work on the mind.

Finally people have others things to do or can't do it at all because of work, money family, and just dont wanna do anything. But at the end of the day it's the persons choice if she/he wanna do it or not but I say no.
