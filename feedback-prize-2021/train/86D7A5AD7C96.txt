I would not think having the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is valuable. The fact that not alot of people want others to know how they feel . Especally teens these days. Teenagers hide alot of emotions for multiple reason. Simply because it can lead to alot of questioning about their life. Not everyone would want people to know what goes on in their life that makes them depressed or sad.

Eckman classified 6 basic emotions - happiness, suprise , anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Why would anyone want anyone else to know if they'er sad or disgusted? What if you was talking to some one and they had an awful smell . Then , the Facial Action Coding System just show how disgusted you are. That would not only hurt the other person's feelings but make you feel mean.

Dr. Huang noted "Most human communication is nonverbal,

including emotional communication," "So computer need to understand that , too" . Most human are nonverbal because they chose not to be. Not every one just want to sit not and talk about their feelings. Also, Dr. Huang noted , "So computers need to understand that , too. Understand what? How might a computer understand? Computers are not humans , they should not have the need to understand anything from a human. That how people these days get so attached to technology. Technology is simply taking over the world and people minds set.

So therefore , i would not think having a the Fscicsl Action Coding Systen in a classroom is valuable.
