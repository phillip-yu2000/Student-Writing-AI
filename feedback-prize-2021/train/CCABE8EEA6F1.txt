If you think that the "Face" on mars is proof of alien life, you are very wrong. Let me explain why. If you think that it is aliens then you obviously haven't seen the other two pictures taken over the years.

The other two pictures taken clearly show the mesa valleys and ravines in the formation. it is just a coincidence that it just so happens to look like a human face. The article even says that it is just a natural land formation nothing else. Cameras have proved it and so have telescopes. It is not an alien monument. The pictures that they took just need to be developed more to really show the valleys and ravines in the land formation.

The second time they looked at the face they used really good cameras and telescopes to see what it actually was! The picture that was taken in 2001 specificly shows what is on the surface of the land formation. So, really when you really think hard about it and think really deep about it it would seem like an alien formation as a sign to us that they are out there. But the photographs don't lie. it is just a natural land formation and nothing else just a really cool coincidence, that's all it is!
