Dear Principal,

I do not believe that you should make all kids do community service, and there are many reasons I believe this. First of all, most kids would object to doing this because it is too much work. All kids think school is to much work to begin with. Speaking of school, it would cut away at our school time too much. if we were all to do an hour of community service within school hours, it would be to much time taken away, near 20 hours each month, almost 3 entire school days wasted. My third and final point is that there is little to do. after a week of community service, almost all the litter everywhere would be picked up. Not to mention there's no town of just old ladies trying to cross the street.

This is why I believe that it is a bad idea to require all students to perform community service. Please consider my letter when you decide whether or not to make this final.
