Dear principal:

I think the principal should make the students do community work so the can help out people who need help. Its also not a waist of time because you are doing something good for the community. It can also change the world if you help some one. Its also not a waist of time for them because your doing something important for someone ells. Also something you might want to do might not be that important. You might just be doing nothing instead you could help some one out or keep the world green and stop pollution. They can also raise money for children in need. for example if they need shoes so they will not be walking bear footed, also they can donate cloth they don't need anymore or want to the children who do really need them. They can also use the money they get to pay for children's doctor bills they could be saving some ones live. Over all i think it is a great thing to do for your self and for some one ells. Its also does not have to be something as big as that it can be something small and it will change the live or lives of some one ells. So i think the principal should require the students to do some community service. It also can teach them a lesson as well, it could teach them if one day they were in the person's place that they are helping they would want some help as well. The students are also going to feel really good inside because they did something for some one who needed it and they will know they changed the life of some one out there. I think you should let the students do community service.
