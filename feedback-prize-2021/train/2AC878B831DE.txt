Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I feel that kids should be required to perform community service. The reasons for this is because it would really help kids understand the fun of giving back to the community. Also just because you do community service, doesn't mean you have to give up ALL your free time. I am required by my mother and father to perform a certain amount of hours of community a month, and I still have time to get done every thing else I want to do.

Doing community service is a good thing for kids to do because it teaches the how to give back to their community. Teenagers can be very "know it all" sometimes and community service shows them that they DON'T know it all... especially when they get to help out on rougher sides of town. Also after i am done with my community service I always have a since of pride that wow i just helped my town be more pretty or helped a little girl have a backpack of food for the weekend. Community service give you a feeling that only comes from knowing that you helped someone.

Sometimes children and teenagers like to use the excuse "I don't have time for that" or "If i do community service, i wont ever get to hang out with my friends." Well it really doesn't take up that much time. Usually i am required to do a certain amount of community service for beta club or by my parents. I always have time still for dance, soccer, friends, homework, surfing, and afters school activity's and I'm a busy person.

Kids can use that excuse but really it doesn't take up that much time.

Well i hope my ideas helped sway your decision on the matter. Kids should be required by not only the school, but by their parents. Community service will leave you with the best feeling you have ever experienced, because you know you are helping someone or something. Helping your community be a better place is very important.
