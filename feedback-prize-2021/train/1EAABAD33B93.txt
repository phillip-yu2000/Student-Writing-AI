Luke Bomberger was a man who worked for a seagoing company thats a person who goes over seas during World War ll to help people and there towns , and citys.

He was in a program called Seagoing Cowboys. In the story are reasons to join the program here are some. You can travel the world and go to places that you have never been. You will travel in the oceans like the Alantic and Pacific. While you do this job if you like animals this would be a good job for you because Luke had to check on the animals every hour so u could sign up for that part .Luke's claim was that being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an job. I know this because the passage says that Seagoing was much more than an adventure " it opened up the world to him".

In all Luke Bomberger was a man who thought that that Seagoing was a lifetime opportunity and loved it.
