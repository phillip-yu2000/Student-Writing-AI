Exploring Venus is just as important as Exporing the solar system. Venus is Earth twin sister in the terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.

Exploring Venus would help us better understand more about our solar system and even our galaxy. With Venus being just like Earth in terms like density and size it would be fun to explore Venus but also Venus isnt that far from us. But by better understanding Venus would help our space techology improve greatly. With better understanding of Venus will better our konwledge not only of our solar system but our galaxy.

Venus has a thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide which is bad for us because carbon dioxide is gas element which traps heat that the sun gives to all the planet in our solar system and with Venus atmophere being mostly carbon. Most heat is trap in Venus atmosphere with little escaping with all that heat that is trap it the tempiture on Venus is very hot even for our spacecraft. But despike this exploring VENus is still a good thing because long ago Venus was once a Earth-like planet just like her twin sister Earth.

Despite the challenge that Venus is giving us we will find a way to get past the acid clouds and the thick carbon dioxid atmosphere because through out human history we have had many challenge as a species but we have proven that we are more than comble of over coming this types of challenges. One day we will get to Venus and we will learn about her because human curiosity always win. No matter how challenging it is we will overcome it. By us finlly understanding Venus will as a species will better our understanding not only our solar system but our galaxy as well.
