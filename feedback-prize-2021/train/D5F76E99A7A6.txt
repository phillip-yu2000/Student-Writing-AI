The electorial college is not what the people want. Isn't this the peoples country, govorned by the people for the people. The eletorial college is good it has our vote in it too but the other half is guys who have great degrees and are all smart wearing suites and decideing what the think is best. There not really thinking about the farmer and what all he does and his troubles. And with the electorial college your not voting for the president your voting for the electors that he has in your state. Also you cant even control who your elctors vote for. The electors can defy the will of the people and thats not what the people want.

The electorial college is unfair to voters,canidates dont spend time in staets were there realy a head or behind just in the tight race states trying to win thos votes. The eltorial college is who wins in your state and thats who gets the votes. You could put votes together with other states and see who has it. It is the peoples choice not the govornments. We need what this country wants not what the govornments wants we are a body. We are a democracy not a dictatorship where the govorment controlls us. We have rights, its a popular vote for everything else why can't the presidential election be a popular vote that way we can speak about what we belive in. The american dream! The farmers and the store owners the ones who break their backs for us all its what we need. We can trust our vote, not the vote we give someone else to vote for us.

So let us have what we want and need as great american citesens of the United Staes of America. You and i both know it's what we need. "It's hard to say this but Bob Dole was right:Abolish the electorial college!"
