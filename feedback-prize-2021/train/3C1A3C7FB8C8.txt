STUDENTS,CELL PHONES, AND SCHOOL

I think that the better policy is Policy 1. Policy 1 ,I think makes a better point and gives the students a lot more freedom.

Policy one is a better choice because as long as they aren't doing anything bad with their cell phones I don't see any problem. Also if they don't use them in any of their classes I don't know why anybody else would mind. Students might also need their phones to call their parents if they forgot something etc. Policy #2 takes all of those possibilities away from the students that have cell phones. They should also be aloud to use them during free time and lunch periods as long as they have obeyed the rule and have not had their phones on during any of their during the school classes. I think that schools should let the students try polisy 1 and if they don't follow the rules then the staff/teachers should enforce Policy2.

That is why I think that students should be aloud to have their cell phones in school.
