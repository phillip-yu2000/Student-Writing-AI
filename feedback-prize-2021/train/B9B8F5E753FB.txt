Dear Principal,

I believe that your Policy 1 is better than your Policy 2. I think this because cell phones can be very helpful in unexpected times of emergency and/or other situations. For example, if something were to happen to a student, whether personal or bad, and the office was not available than the student could use their cell phone. Another reason is that this gives students an opportunity to communicate with other siblings or friends that do not go to the same school. Also, if there was an emergency involving another family member or close family friend, it would be easier to contact the student with the cell phone especially if it was a very personal family matter. If the students were not allowed to have cell phones in school at all and let's say, for a student, plans had changed for who was picking he/she up and it was decided by the parents after school was out. How would they contact him/her to let them know? Also, how would that student know how to deal with the situation? Cell phones help kids stay aware and figure out how to handle certain things that come their way during their days at school. So, from all this I think that kids should be allowed to bring cell phones to school. But, only as long as they keep them off and in their lockers or book bags during all class hours.
