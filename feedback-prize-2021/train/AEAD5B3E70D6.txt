Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although it's embarrassing to say, we have grown quite dependent on our phones. Due to this I believe we should be able to use our phones in some form or capacity while in vehicles. There are a multitude of reasons one may need to use their phone while in a car.

One reason they should be able to use their phones while in the car is for navigation. Many people only use their phones for the gps feature. A lot of people have a poor sense of direction or don't know how to read maps. It's also useful if one gets lost and needs help getting out of that situation.

Another reason they should be able to use their phones is in case of emergencies. One might need to alert the authorities for some reason. It could be an accident on the road where the police are needed. There may be a fire in need of firefighters or something along those lines. There's no telling there might even be a need for animal protective services, these things happen.

Although phones shouldnt be used for a lot of things while in the car, this shouldnt expel them from being used in all forms in the car. Accidents may very well happen because of "text and drivers", so maybe they shouldn't text and drive. Completely banning cell phones though? That seems to be a stretch. Personally speaking I've lived in Georgia for two years and I still need the GPS to get around. Who has the time or patience to carry a map of georgia and pull it up to read it at every stop sign? The phones still can do alot of good while inside of vehicles. They can be used for emergencies. They can also be used for navigation. They even can just be used as a music player.
