Phones and Driving

Do you know anybody that has suffered serious consequences because of texting and driving? Using phones while your driving is a very dangerous thing. You do not see people posting stuff on social media about how phones are good to use while driving. But what you do see are articles and websites talking about victims dying because of texting and driving. There is nothing on your phone that is more important than your life.

No matter what you say about texting and driving or how many people die from it, people are still gonna do it. When you are going somewhere and check the review, but the reviews are bad and all negative, you aren't going to want to go to that place. It is the same thing with texting and driving. You see all these articles and news reports about people dying . Thats the same thing as a bad report but for some reason people still text and drive. Phones are nothing but a distraction when in the car.

Texting and driving is one of the main death for teens. Teens are less experienced drivers so even a little distraction is not good. Many states are taking an action and making cell phone use illegal while driving unless it is hands free. Hoping this will make the roads safer, some people are still gonna do what they want to do. Any cell phone use while in the car has led to millions of crashes yearly. Driving takes all your attention to the rode. I do not agree with texting and driving and i agree with all the actions they are doing to help prevent it.

I hope one day we will be able to cut down on texting and driving . It is sad seeing all the bad things that occur from it. The world would be such a better place without texting and driving.
