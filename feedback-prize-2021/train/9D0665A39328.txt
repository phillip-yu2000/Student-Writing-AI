Seeking advice from different people can be helpful, because it can expand upon your view of a topic.

A person asking for advice will sometimes ask multiple people for advice, to get different opinions on a topic

These opinions can either help the person with learning about a topic or they could just be receiving incorrect information. This can also lead to the person becoming confused about the topic and ultimately fail to resolve their topic. And while they are confused the could be led to do the wrong thing and lead to worse consequences.

But they can also gather a lot of correct information which would help with opening them up to more choices, if given the correct information. Getting advice from multiple people can also lead to choices that benefit more people or just a more open minded decision. These decisions can really affect the outlook of someones topic, for somebody giving a person incorrect advice could lead to a horrible decision.

But most importantly while seeking advice you should seek multiple inputs to decide which one is the best fit, so when you make your final choice its the best one. Making sure the advice you get is credible is also easier when you ask multiple people because of similar advice.

For the best advice you should ask multiple people it expands upon your view of thew topic and greatly helps you come to a final decision and helps you learn even more.
