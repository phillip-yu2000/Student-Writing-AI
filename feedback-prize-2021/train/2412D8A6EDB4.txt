Dear Editor:

I heard that you are deciding on whether or not you want to make every student do community service. Some students do community service because they have to in some form of punishment.

I believe that if a student has done something wrong, for a punishment you should then make them do community service.

For example if a student breaks one of the rules and gets in a fight with someone at the school on school property, the punishment you could give them instead of suspension is community service.

Some students volunteer in community service because they like to help out the community if they have spare time. Usually when students volunteer in community service, it's because they want to.

Other students don't volunteer in community service because they feel like its a waste of their time and they won't be able to do what they want.

I don't think it's a good idea that you want to make sure every student performs some kind of community service because some students might be busy and not have time to perform any community service and if they don't, they will probably get punished even if it's not their fault.

So in conclusion of this statement, I personally don't think making every student perform community service is a good idea.

Of course they can do it if they are being punished but it shouldn't be required.

Your Student,
