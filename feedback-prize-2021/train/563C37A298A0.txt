Technology is moving very quickly during this century. Having driverless cars is just amazing. You wouldn't have to worry about too many accidents on the road. I believe that future cars are going to be smarter than people.

First off human drivers do not keep their hands on the wheel the whole time they are driving. BMW has made cars with special touch sensors that make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel the whole time. This part of the technology will help a lot out with those reckless drivers. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Also the Google car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. These special features in cars will help prevent road accident. Even though this driverless cars are fully driverless they will set a big mark in the vehicle industry.
