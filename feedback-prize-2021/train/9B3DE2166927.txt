WHY THEIR SHOULD'NT BE CELL PHONES IN SCHOOL

Dear principal

,

I think that their should be no cell phones at school .I think that this will des tract me and other students from learning. Even if you allow them to only use them during lunch and free time. after that they will still want to use them their not going to lea son . To what it is that you are saying .Or they will lea son but if their phone go off in class they are going to say it is because they forgot to turn it off or back down and then they will make it so that it is all your fault and that will be another big story so im going to say go with policy 2 so that you don't have a whole big mess and so that you don't have a whole big angry mob of parents at your door. Bringing cell phones into school is a whole big thing . and its a very bad idea .this sis school we don't need cell phones in here to des tract us from school kids grades are already flunking and we don't need no more detracting. If we don't have no cell phones. It wont be as many student in the after school. That way we can just consecrate better.

sincerely ,
