The Seagoing Cowboys program is the best around, we travel alot over seas to help others. You can also go sightseeing along the way! You get the thrill of seeing new things and helping those in need.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a unbelievable opprotunity for anyone! Including me, a small town boy that worked on a farm. When my freind Don Reist invited me to Europe on a cattle-boat I could not help myself, I had to go! When I first go onto the boat I was a little nervous but over time I got more acustomed to the life on the boat. I went to many places including Greece, Europe, China, Crete, and Italy!

Life on the boat is mostly fun! But there are some dangers too, I fell off a slippery ladder and I went feet first to the Atlantic. Luckily I got caught in a strip of metal on the side of the ship, but I could not worked because of cracked ribs. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys would satisfy your thirst for adventure. But being in the program also involves hard work, and if you are wanting to help others in need than that work must be done.

You have to feed and care to the animals on board, and if you do that then you can also find time to have fun! You can play games like Table-Tennis, fencing, Boxing, baseball, and volleyball! I loved caring to the animals and having fun whilst doing so.

I was in the Seagoing Cowboys the most of any one. I made nine trips and I was discharged in 1947. I liked being in the Seagoing Cowboys, it revealed a world of people in need. That awareness stayed with me which led my family to host many international students and exchange visitors for years.
