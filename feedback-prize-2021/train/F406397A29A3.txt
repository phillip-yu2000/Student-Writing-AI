Limiting car usage would not be good for few citizens. Some citizens are just plain lazy and have no sense of being active. But they are good sides of lowering car usage like citizens will have a more open community, citizens will save alot of money throughout the year, and the cities air would be less harmful.

To begin with, Some cities are just known for not having safe communities. But i think limiting car usage will make people interact with one another. The community will eventually join together and everyone will know everybody. Maybe the same neighbor you hate that lives across from you will become your best friend because you guys can walk to the same places together. I think that'll be utopia for cities across the United States.

To add on, They are citizens everyday that struggle everyday just to go to the store to buy some food for the house. I feel like this would save alot of money for citizens and it'll help them spend it on other things they need. I sometimes have struggled on my own to just to make it to school because i don't have any money for gas. I Think this is the main reason why citizens will benefit from the limitation of car usage.

Lastly,Limiting the car usage will greatly benefit the cities air. Some cities in the us have a bad reputation of having alot of air polution. I think after a while the cities will eventually just run on having no cars on the streets because of how good it was the cities air. It'll turn out to be a win-win situation for everyone.

In conclusion, Limiting car usage will first be a hard task to do but it think eventually everyone will adapt to it. Limiting the air pollution, saving alot on gas money, and building a better community are all great factors in this change. They're is many more good factors into doing this but these are just some i thought i should talk about.
