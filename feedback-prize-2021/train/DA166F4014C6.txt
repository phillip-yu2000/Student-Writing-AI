The idea of driverless cars has long been fantisiesed but i think it is a bad idea to have driverless cars because computers are not very reliable and cant think like a person can even with the technology such as a Dubbed LIDAR that uses laser beams to constantly update a 3-D model to help the car mimic that of what a human can do in my opinion why try to mimic a human when you can just use a human to do the job.

Most ¨self¨ driveing cars are not really self driveing at all most of them are just assisting the driver so when the driver gets in a spot such as work zones our accedents it has to warn the driver to take over. Most of the cars that are self driveing requier the driver to keep there hands on the wheel and to pay attintion to the road and many of them has there own alert system such as GM has a drivers seat that will vibrate when the driver is needed and there are also other way that the car gets the drivers attintion by flashing lights and other heads up displays.

There is alot of debate on the laws of driverless car such as how would the laws work and most states dont alow testing of driverless cars. The cars are not safe how can they be? the cars use technolagy that can and will fail nomatter what any one say can the self driveing cars pull off the side of the road in case of a brake down? will it move for a pot whole? can it tell the differnce from a human or a random object there are so many questions that can be asked and i doubt many of them can be ansewrd so the fact is are ¨driverless¨ cars really safe? I think that cars should be left alone and let people drive there selfes around and as many people say ¨if it aint broke why fix it¨ so why would you change something such as actual people driveing and have cars ran by a computer drive when they can an will fail.
