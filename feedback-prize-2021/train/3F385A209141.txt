I would tell them that other scientists have looked in to it and its not a face.

Then i would say that it is a Martian Mesa and thats it looks like a face but if you do your research right you will be like oh i got it. I would say that they got many of these kind face shaped things in the west. But i would also say that it was cloudy around that planet at this time of year. So i would say that maybe the clouds formed a face like figure cause many times I have went outside and have seen a cloud that looks like a face and that even if the wind is blowing the clouds stay in one form. I would say some researches have looked into it and they have snapped 10 pictures of a face like figure but it turns out to be a natural landform. Last i would say that the face like figure is equivalent to the Lava Dome And about the same height as the Face On Mars.
