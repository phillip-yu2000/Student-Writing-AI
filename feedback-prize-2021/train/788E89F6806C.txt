Dear Principal,

Allowing phone usage will allow the student to be organization because most student have a smart phone which will allow them to take note and always have them. the phones will allow them to look up I formation on the internet. They could even organize due dates an class times so student will be on time and always have their work on time. phones could help in math classes because of the calculator and timer. In science class it could help in experiments by taking pictures and looking at other resources. Some phones have APP so the they can get to information quickly. You could also put a text book APP on your phone some the school doesn't have to pay that much money for the books. It will also cut down on the technology use and you could spend all this saved money on field trips extra curricular activity.
