There is a wide variety of reasons to why students take there classes at home; for example, medical issues, behavioral issues and environmental issues that are not safe for students; however, students that take there classes at there school districts have a higher chance of grasping information much more faster and in a timely efficient period, and the reason to that is because school students experience real time activities that help them understand what they are learning from their daily experiences at school.

However the students that take classes online do not have the hands on experience;such as, school projects, peer projects and educational field trips. Some people may say that home schooling is better due to the large cases of bullying, but that problem can always be solved, by reporting to your office or to your teacher.

To furthermore student that take their courses on the internet or by video conferencing do not benefit as much as how a real time student that go to school in there day to day basis; neither less, the students that take classes online tend to have problems in focusing, they can do whatever they want to do whenever they want, from my experience, on online classes, the only reason I took online classes is to experience it, and

I learned that most of the information that was provided to me was not live or even video provided, so i would always questions running in the back of my mind wondering when will it ever be answered.

I always had mental breakdowns due to the stress i was getting, and that is where the idea of online classes shinned in my thoughts; however, I tried taking online classes but in less a month I started experiencing depression because there was nobody to talk to, I was easily distracted by everything surrounding me, specially my phone. Some schools dont allow phones at school, for example in my freshmen I went to an international school, and the number rule was no gadgets on school grounds, at first

I thought it was funny but when i opened my phone at school they immediately confiscated my phone, and I had to call my parents so they can pick my phone up from the school principal, and i had to undergo a lesson to why phones are not allowed on school grounds?; such as; to what phone could cause to students at school?

I thought they made a big deal about it but actually they were right, it makes student lazy, self-centered, and mainly it stops you from doing your work most of the time if addicted. its the same thing when using online courses, for teen students specifically, statistics show that teenagers easily loose their patience and jump to using their cell-phones;however,all student should be supervised, so they could show better scores on there work and get help whenever they needed .

Schools provide the atmosphere for student to learn and understand topics that inflict our lives in different ways, ranging in hundred and maybe to thousands of specialties in learning new information everyday, schools provide materials that help student experience what there learning in their topics and make it more interesting. All children should always go to schools before requesting for homeschooling so they can experience hands on work, create new friendships that also can affect there choices on homeschooling and for counselors to understand why student want to be home schooled.
