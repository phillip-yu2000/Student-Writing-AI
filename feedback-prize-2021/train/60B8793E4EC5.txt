Dear principal,

I think community service is a great thing to have required by all students, it will help the world and all of the people in it to be kinder.

With using community service it doesn't have to be boring many ideas the students may enjoy; including cleaning up litter, helping nursing homes or pet services.

Doing the service doesn't have to take up too much of the time for what you want to do or what you need to do.

It can be done quickly and easily with help and also if you enjoy it, it wont be as time consuming or a drag.

not only will doing community service be helpful it will also make a good impression and make others happy or thankful for it.

for example, just by doing a little amount of litter pick up can make others decide to do it and then the whole world could become a much cleaner place over time.

If you help a nursing home you can help by giving the people company, help cleaning, and make the employees jobs a little less stressful. With one person helping to change the world it will make it better one step at a time.

No matter if someone says they hate it or not I think is something out there for everyone.

This concludes that I agree with community service being required and think it should be required for all of our students, no matter a persons age or their abilities.

Thank you for all of your concern and taking the time to read my letter.

Sincerely,

One student for community service
