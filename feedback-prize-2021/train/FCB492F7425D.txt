Driverless Approved

I beleive that driverless cars are the future and that it will be safer than today. I think that soon no matter what technology will advance and long with it driverless cars. I have multiple reasons why driverless cars will be good.

I beleive that the driverless cars will also be safer than cars today. There wont be the need for human error. One example is a student driver not knowing when to go.

I beleive that driverless cars will be a faster way to travel. Today people slow down or are nervous at the wheel. They dont know what the car in front will do so they slow down. The driverless cars will know what is coming before any human could know.

I believe that driverless cars will be more affordable. all drtiverless cars should be somewhat the same. There shoulnd't be a need for a fancier car since there wouldnt be a point for it to go fast.

To conclude id klike to say that i approve driverless cars coming in the near future. They will be safer, quicker, and more affortable. Nothing can beat that.
