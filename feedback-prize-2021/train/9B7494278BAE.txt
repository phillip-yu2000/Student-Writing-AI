Texting and driving

Even though majority of humans own and operate a phone on a daily basis,but honestly i don't think anyone should operate a cell phone under a wheel because it causes the driver to become distracted and lose control of the wheel causing an innocent driver to lose their life or even both of them to lose their life,it also may cause the driver to get so distracted that they run the light and hit somebody.

It has been said that not only the texting have caused the descraction in drivers but the social network,gps systems,music apps and other things also draw the attention of drivers away from the road,cell phone use behind the wheel also reduces the amount of brain activity used to drive by 37 percent,there have been tools created to hold the phone on the dashboard to avoid drivers to hold the phone while they drive,but not even the tools created could not stop the accidents.

There have been many stories of teens losing their life due to texting and driving causing grief from family but if teens choose to put the phone down while driving or text before they start the car there would have been less accidents in the united states,honestly i think drivers get distracted either way if they use the equipment for the phones or not because if they was to get a text or phone call they still gonna look off the road and possibly cause an accident,ways people could possibly stop this would be to lead by an example maybe if someone show other the proper way to drive they would want to drive good just takes one person to show others the right way.
