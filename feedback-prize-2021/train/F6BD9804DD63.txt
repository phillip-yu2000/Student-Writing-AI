People have always thought about diverless cars to be a long way into the future but its not as far as people think. Google has had driverless cars since 2009. I think people should support the development of these cars. The reasons I think people should support are they can be used to replace old taxis with new driverless ones, less crashes, and the car would be more helpful. I think driverless cars is a brilliant technological advancement

.

The public transportation system will benefit greatly from the driverless cars. The driverless cars would replace the old taxis with newer better cars. The cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis. The driverless cars would alse offer more flexibility than big busses and use less fuel than them. These smart cars will change the transportation system for the better.

Google's driverless cars have been driving since 2009 under specific conditions. The cars have driven more than half a million miles without a single crash. Even though Google's smart cars are truly driverless yet they still have not been in a car crash. If a drunk person where to drive a normal car most likely that person would crash and hurt or kill themselves and people around them but if they were to be in a driverless car the car would just drive the person home with no problem. I believe if more people were to buy these cars when they come out then the amount of car crashes would go down.

These cars would be more useful. With letting the person in the car do something else while the car is driving. It would allow people to get things done while the car is driving for you. This car will be very useful.

With theses reasons and more I believe that people should be supporting the development of these facinationg cars. The smart cars will improve the public transportation system, there would be less crashes, less people dying nad geting hurt, the cars would be more helpful. Thats why I believe these cars would be a great technological advancement.
