The so called "Face" on Mars brought an abundance of attention to NASA and the planet Mars. Everything from magazines, books, and a movie talked about how the Face was created by aliens. The Face was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform found on Mars.

The Face was reveald from a photo taken by Viking 1 in 1976. The photo taken looked like a face because the cameras where not as advance has they are today. The photo was taken with a resolution with 43 meters per pixel leaving out many details that could not be captured, therefore making the landform appear as if it were a face. When NASA took a seccond photo with a camera that had a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel in the exact same location as the first photo was taken the image looked nothing like a face because it captured many more details than the first this show the distortion of the first caused it to look like a face. Also when the seccond photo was taken it was a clear day and there was not any clouds unlike the first photo which means it could not have been affected at all. Unlike the seccond image the first had clouds which could draken or lighten the image in certain places to give details that make it look like a face are not actually there on the landform.

In conclusion, the so called "Face" on Mars is nothing but a landform on the planet. It was not created by aliens, but the planet it self. It just happend to resemble a face because of poor resolution and clouds in the atmoshere.
