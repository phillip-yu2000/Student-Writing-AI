You should join this program called the UNRRA or the United Nations Relief and Rehabiliation Administration. This program goes over seas to go and help people rebuild there country that was destroyed by the WW2 war. If you like animals and traveling to new plaes this is the place to join.

This administration is a very good program.

You really get the best of both worlds because you could try something new and you get to visit countries that you have never could have. There was a fellow named Luke Bomberger and, his friend asked if he wanted to go on a Europe cattle boat. He took the oppertunity and it changed the whole life for him. He even said that you would find it a hard time to not have fun. On the way there You constantly took care of the cattle and that always kept him busy Luke said. On the back he had a blast with all of his new friends they played: table tennis, baseball, volleyball, fencing,boxing, reading, whittling, and other games that helped him pass time.

This trip will change your life. You should really join this program. It really shows you how lucky we are to have what we have now( technology and other fun games). It is also a fun thing to do with all of the other entertaining activities. If you do it you will be saving thousand and thousands of people but having fun too. You should really consider joining the UNRRA.
