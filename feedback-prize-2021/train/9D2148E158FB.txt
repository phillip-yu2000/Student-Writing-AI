The seagoing cowboys is a program that helps animals at sea be healthy and cared for. I will give you some reasons why you should join the program.

I think this is a good idea because animals that arent taken care of well might get sick and mabey even die. Another reason why you should join the program is because they take care of horses, young cows , and mules that are being shiped to europe because world war two was happening and many countries need needed supplies. The seagoing cowboys also took care of 335 horses while there was another war was happening Luke said "we arrived Agust 1945", "the day the pacific war ended".

The seagoing cowboys is a good way to keep animals safe on boats, even if it is hard work and it takes weeks and months to reach your destination so be ready. If you plan on joining the program be sure to pack right and if things get tough rember it is for a good cause and that cause is to keep animals safe at sea, and it just might be an adventure of an life time.
