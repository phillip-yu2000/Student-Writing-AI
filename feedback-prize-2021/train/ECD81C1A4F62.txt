I think all the students could do the community work. That way not just one person is doing the work for everyone. Also if everyone does the community work it would be getting done faster and you wouldn't have to keep asking others to help. If all the students do the community work then that can help them realize and understand what needs to be done around our country/area. it will also teach the students to respect the planet we live on and not to litter or do something bad to something that is not ours. Maybe it would help teach the kids to work together and it would get them outside . It could show others that don't like to do work for others or pick up after them self's / others that if they all worked together they wouldn't have to worry about doing the work if they just didn't litter or vandalize others stuff that doesn't belong to them . So i take position to saying the principal to making everyone do community work even if its out side of school, just for maybe an hour maybe every other day, to get the students to learn to work together, get along and respect others property and belongings, help other kids that may be behind in something or just need a little more understanding in a subject some homework that they didn't quiet didn't understand at home that night.
