Dear Senator ,

I personally think that the electoral college should not be abolished. Yes some things are unfair for example : voters don't vote for the president directly and the fact that voters can't always control whom their electors vote for . That's life though , life is unfair to everyone . Instead of shutting the whole electoral college down , they should try to improve it so the voters can be satisfied . The electoral college plays a big part in the voting process. Although there are many unfair things the electoral college helps. The president should be elected by the electors because they know more than the amount of people who voted for them so they could elect the president. I believe that the voting process is not as simple as it looks , it's more complicated then that , it might seem simple to us but complicated to others. The voting process would be harder without the electoral college and the citizens won't have anyone or anything to guide them. A lot of us don't really know about politics , the real side of the candidate shows when he become the president , the electors can already start to see the real side of the candidate even though he's not the president. The citizens need a group of people to guide them in the right direction so they won't regret the choices that they made . Yes the electoral college has a few negative things but it's for the best. In my opinion electoral college should continue because overall this process helps a lot. Instead of stating the wrong facts about the electoral college , we should all try to make it a better process so all the people who think it's unfair think otherwise.

I genuinely think that this process is for the best and I hope that you will think about everything I just said and try to improve this good process.

Sincerely ,
