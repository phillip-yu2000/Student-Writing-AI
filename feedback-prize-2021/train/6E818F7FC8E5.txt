The claim the author gave about going to venus and researching it from a safe distance is good,Because it will give great information about venus and how it works."striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has high value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself". This is saying that going to venus will help us understand how the planet works.

Venus is worth researching even though the casualties could be high and the risks could be."Weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerfull earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface". This is saying that there is alot of risk in going to go research venus.

In conclusion i think that we should go to venus becasue it will get us more closer to landing on venus. Researching venus will get us more closer to landing on it because the research will tell us when the temperatures will be lower and when everything is good.
