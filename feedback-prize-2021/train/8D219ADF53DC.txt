The Facial Action Coding System also is calles the FACS is a interesting solfware. The can be use for great things, but human emotions are complicated. The system emotion need to be bigger cause human have more emotions then happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. I think that the FACS is bad for student to use right now.

The thing I do like abot the the solfware is that it can help alot of kids that wasn't tought right or just don't get certain things. For a solfware that can change the learning process just for you to make it more challenging or make it easier just for is amazing. This the way I look at the solfware will give everybody a better chance cause it not so straight forward as you read this and you have to understand or you can't pass on. Now It can find interesting things you like to read and it make people want to read. This machine also help the teachers cause they can't help every student if they have a class of 30 student.

This is were this solfware go wrong human have way more then six emotions. These emotion we have is very complicated to the point that we don't understand them some times. For a machine to change how we learn on facail expresion is bad because we can be sick and it change the actical cause it thing we are bored or disgusted. That might really like that artical. The same can be said if a person is in pain it can say that person is angry or sad. This is the big flaw with this machine even if it is rightthe teacher or someone can go look back at that and see everything you are feeling. that can be alittle to personal for some people.

This is my thought aboot the solfware. It is very great, and can be very helpful for a lot of people. The big flaws with it is that itcan be to personal for some people. The other big flaw with it the emotion part it vision it to narrow it need to be widen up cause it emotion people it might cagorize it under something it might not be.
