Dear

State Senato r,

I think that the Electoral College should change to popular votes for the president and I have a few reasons why: When people vote for a president they are actually voting for the Electoral College and the Electoral College votes for the president themselves and sometimes the voters vote for the wrong canidate and the presindent they wanted to vote for might not win the election, Some states do not get to see their canidates or the election and don't know who to vote for. I think that voters should be able to vote who they want to run our country and not have the Electoral College decide for them. They have a voice and a mind to their own and I believe that we should have a say on who should be our president, our leader, someone who will stop ISIS and to stop terroists and bombings, someone who will pass laws that child abuse should be illegal. It can be argued that the Electoral Colleges method of selecting the president might turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Candidates have a winner-take-all system and its unfair because they do not spend time in states that they know will have no chance winning. I think that they should give them a chance, just because they think that they can;t win it doesn't make it tur, its more of their opinion. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, outdated, and irrational. The Electoral College won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The voters would prefer a direct election.
