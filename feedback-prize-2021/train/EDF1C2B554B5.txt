Dear principal,

I believe policy one, allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time, would be a better thing to do. Using them during free time could be good, or really bad. Having them out and texting our friends would be one thing, but what if they're texting someone they don't like, and calling them hurtful words and just tearing that person apart. That wouldn't be so great. That's why I believe we should just have them in school and not really have free time with them,

just have them with us for emergencies. Walking home for an example, what if someone is walking home from school and get kidnapped, or hurt themselves and no one is around to help, then what could they do? They'd just lay there in agonizing pain until someone found them. It would be useful if we had our phones on us, just not using them. Then we could be safe, and not have so much drama. I'd consider putting in a policy three, allow students to bring our cell phones for emergencies and after school hours, not for during class, lunch
