There are many advantages to limiting the usuage of a car.  One big one that most countries are trying to deal with is lower the deverity of greenhouse gases or smog.  For example, in source one Elisabeth Rosenthal states," And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes."  Also in source two, Robert Duffer explains," After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."  Source three also explains how a decrease in car usage could help with air pollution.  Andrew Selsky writes," It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."  Also in source four Elisabeth Rosenthal," ... It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largerst source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."  Stated clearly by the four sources, the greatest advantage of decreases the usage of cars is the decrease in air pollution.  Along with that people can start becoming stress free and more relaxed than ever before.
