Dear principal Generic_Name, I know you want EVERY student to do clubs, but I have some advice for you. So, every student has their own talent but some students either don't have talents or want to show to other people. But what if a student has a family emergency or something like that. I know that some students want to do it and some that don't want to. One reason that students don't want to do it is because they don't want to stay in school longer, we go to school 7 hours a day, 5 days a week, but we want to relax at home, thats want we look forward to, going home after 7 hours of not doing the thing we love. I understand that students like school and want to present their talents after the 7 hours. But, it is not fair to choose fot the sudents. So, in my conclusion don't make EVERY student do it, let them choose what they want to do.Â
