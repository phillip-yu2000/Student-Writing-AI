People who do this not care about the life of others or don't even think that they are putting their self at risk. There has been times a car comes out totalled due to the fact that a driver wasn't paying attention to the road and causes a accident when all you need to do is pay attention to the road and nothing else. People that text and drive are ignorant people and are very dumb for doing this.

Phones should be put away in the glove compartment or keep somewhere out of reach because it can be very tempting to grab your phone to see if someone has texted you. When driving your number one priority is to be focused on the road and nothing else. When wanting to text do it at a red light that way you are putting people out of danger.
