some people do not want to participate in community service but I think people should. why? because it teaches them responsibility , it will make the world a better place , and it will inspire other people to do the same.

first , participating in community service will make the world a better place. for example some students will decide to clean up litter. that will make the world look better. instead of trash laying there on the floor students will help clean it up. also if they want to participate in the animal shelter by helping the animals that will make the world a better place by there being enough dogs for children to enjoy. who would not want there children to be happy with a fluffy little dog by there side? that student will help on saving a cat or dogs life.

secondly , it will teach the student responsibility .how? well the student will learn that some things just wont be fun in life. for example cleaning up trash on the floor may not be as fun but it teaches the student responsibility. also it assures them that they should do what is best for them. cleaning on the streets may make them realize that they should clean there room also. don't you think that is true?

Lastly , if the students will take community service it will inspire other people to do the same. for example it may inspire people that are not in school such as there parents! now if they take community service they will work together as a team with there children what parent would not want to work with there children?

just to recap you should decide to make the students do community service it will teach them responsibility , make the world a better place and it will inspire people to do the same. I hope you like my letter.
