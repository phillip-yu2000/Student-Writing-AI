I have to say driverless cars would be pretty amazing if they were to come in a couples years but lets be honest do you really think they'll be a good thing for the people in this world.

I honestly dont think we should have driverless cars, what would happen to the tickets we get for speeding or doing something wrong what are you going to do? Blame it on the car for speeding who would take responsiblty for that or, what about the bad people in this world what if they get a hold of the car they can proabaly turn it againist us for bad or, what if your on your phone and you and you think the car is driving for you but its time for you to take control of the car and your not paying atttention that can cause alot of car recks or accidence that can probably kill people. If we have cars that can already drive by there selves, no up coming teenagers are not going to know how to drive which can cause alot of car crashes too if you gotta turn back control of the car and you can't drive obveiously thats a cause for a desater. I dont think ths would make the world a better place honest let just stick to regular cars you can control yourself and always got full admission to.
