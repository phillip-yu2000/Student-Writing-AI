To Whom It May Concern:

Community service is a great way to help out the community. I highly suggest that your students help out the community. Not only does it help your community, but it makes others feel that we should do something to help out too. It can change our world. If your students work together, they can make a difference in the world.

Recycling is a fantastic way to help out the community. It helps reduce waste and does not fill up our land fills as much as we normally do. In only one hour, we can fill up a person's home with garbage. Also, if some kids drive to school, they can carpool with another student and that helps reduce pollution. If we carpool, we help reduce gas usage and it saves the air from being so polluted.

Thank you for your time. I hope you and your school can help out the community and make a difference in the world. It will be a fun experience for them to know they helped out with the community. It is all worth it for all of their hard work. Thank you for your consideration and your time.

Sincerely,
