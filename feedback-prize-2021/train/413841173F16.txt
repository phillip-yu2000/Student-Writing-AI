Dear principle,

I agree very much with your new rule in progress. children athletes under a B average need to focus on more on school than their sports, because there is a very small chance that they will be a professional sports player when they get older. Something may happen to them now, like they could damage a part of their body permanently. But if they do good in school and learn some things, then they could still have a chance for a good life because they will have what they learned in this school to carry with them all of their life. Because no matter what situation your in you will always have your knowledge. That kind of stuff sticks with you for life. I'm not saying all of these things just to talk, I'm saying it because i really do care about the future of my fellow students. I mean, one of those football players may have an accident and have to have a leg amputated tomorrow. But he will have more time to study on school and get more knowledge. And you never know he could become our future president and thank you for making that rule because with out it he would have never become president. So that is my opinion on your new rule on C average sports players, and I hope you and other fellow students agree with me so we can make a better tomorrow for our students.

Your Student,
