To Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I have a complaint on your new policy of having to have a B average to participate in extracurricular activities It is unfair to not let a majority of the school be a part in these activities. Many of the students with a C average want to participate and have proven to be really good at it. They have been trying to get into these programs for years, and some of them have been in them for years until your new policy. Also this policy has not only effected these students, but also the sport teams. Until now our teams have always been near the top, but now our teams have gone way downhill because most of our best players have around a C average.

Please TEACHER_NAME, adjust your policy, to getting at least a C average instead of a B. If you change it, you will not only make me happy, but you will also make a majority of the school happy, and our sport teams will be able to make it back near the top. Most of us will probably even try harder to get better grades since we know you have been kind enough to give us a chance and not get stricter and keep increasing the limits on your policy, making us know we can't get those grades, and give up. So please, change your policy for me, the teams, and the rest of the school.

From,

STUDENT_NAME
