The Electoral college is an unesessary procces of which The U.S.A does not need. It is has too many flaws in its system. Such as the way the votes work. Sure, the American people able to say their input, but they aren't able to say it directly. Also the confusion that the voting system works might make voters confused as to who they voting for. All in all this is not the voting system that America needs. What is needed is a direct form of voting.

Throughout the years, it has become apparent that The Electoral college is a disaster. Considering all the mishaps that have already occured due to the system, would it be safe to allow it to continue?Â  "Back in 1960, segregrationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing Deocratic electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)" This even being a possibility is more than enough. It is time for a change.

Now, if a tie were to occur in the electoral vote, the election would be handed over to the House of Representatives. From there on the delegators are in charge. Since each state is only able to cast one vote, the will of the people is oppresed. This is not the American way. All should have their say in the matter. Altough, yes voting is still task that most American find annoying and do not take part of, but with this change more people might start seeing that hey can make a change and start voting when it comes to it.
