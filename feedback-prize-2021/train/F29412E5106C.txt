The Eloctoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Why should people give thier time and effort if not all the time they get to control whom they choose. Worst part about some states to even get a chance to choose the electors. So what's the point of doing it, if your just going to be cheated on by the Congress or by the electors who dont even, sometimes choose thier own people.

Source 2, states that"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president". This statement is saying that the voters of each state are not really voting for the president, just really being cheated by the system. So why should voters give time and effort if thier vote is not truly going to make a difference to the system. All those hundreds and thousands votes are giving to electors so they can make the vote for us. Wow that's how system works, taking the people votes what a shame.

Source 2, it states that "Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candiate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..." It is stating that, some electors will disrespectful and a candidate who is not even that party. What was so hard to choose a candidate from your own party and then want to be aynamous about it. Why would an elector join a party just so they can stab them in the back.

In conclusion the electoral college system should be shutdown beacuse obviously their are some diffcults in running the system and the most the voters think that it is a diasater factor.
