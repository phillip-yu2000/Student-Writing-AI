I believe students shouldn't be excluded from sports and other activities unless a B average because some students have a C average and they could be great athletes even if their grades are lower than a B average they should still get a chance like everyone else and students should be able to participate in activities because if they have been working hard year round they deserve to be able to go to school Dances, Basketball games, and more because they have worked hard at getting those grades even if they have lower than a B average .

Students with a grade lower than a B

average should be able to participate in school Activities and Sports because the students have earned those grades even if they are lower then a B average they have worked hard to contain those grades and it wouldn't be very fair to a student that has worked hard to keep his or her grades the same to not be able to go to school basketball games , school activities and much more .

Students deserve to participate in school activities also because most students have favorite things to do and maybe they need some time away from all the school work and test and at those activities they can have fun and enjoy themselves. this policy would be very unfair and an insult to students without a B average or higher because every student should be able to do school Activities and Sports unless they did something very bad in school.

This is the reason that i believe students without a lower grade than a B average should be able to participate in school activities .
