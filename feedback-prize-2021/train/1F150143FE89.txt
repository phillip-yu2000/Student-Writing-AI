School policy

I think that we should be allowed to use are cell phones during lunch period do to it being are free time to talk to each other during lunch. If we are far away from each other or to speak with parents at school incase we need to tell them something important, like if I had a test coming up or something was on the counter and I needed mom or dad to grab it for me,

or if I left something for them at the house and they did not notice it yet. I believe we should be able to use are cell phones in school lunch period but turn it off after lunch so we are not able to text are friends who are in class and do not disturb there work in progress. These are some reasons why I think we should be able to use phones at lunch, There for I will go with policy 1. Other times during school we should also be able to use cell phones for that time but when the free time is over then we will turn are cell phones off and go on with are normal day. I hope that you agree with the terms listed.
