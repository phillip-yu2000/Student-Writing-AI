The prompt is talking about if people are able or unable to use their cell phone while they are driving or when they are at a stop light or stop sign. I think people shouldn't be able to use their cell phone, the reason why is because most of the time car crashes happened when people are using their cell phone but, I think people are able to use their cell phone when they are at a stop light. When people are using their cell phones that what causes a car crash. The way people get in a car crash is when they driving and looking at the cell phone to text people back they look away for a good amount of second that a car can switch to their line and because the person on their cell phone they would see in till it is to late. people shouldn't use their cell phone because most death are because or the cell phone. But at a stop light I think people are able to look at their cell phone and use it because you are not moving or anything you are just in one spot, so you won't hit anything and you do got time to use their cell phone because the light takes forever to change to green. So to me I disagree that using your cell phone while driving should be a no go because that's how much of the people get a ticket or get into a car crash that sometimes they get hurt or they hurt others so that's why it think driving while using your phone should be banned. But I agree that if you are at a stop light you are able to use your for because you are in one places you are not moving at all and also the light takes time to change so you can go that why I agree that it is the only time to see who texted you and text back.
