Driverless cars are good and bad for us human beings. Here are three good reasons and three bad reasons. Three goood reasons are: the person in the car desnt have to worry about driving, the person in the car doesnt have to worry about texting and driving, and also the seats vibrate whenever the car is in reverse or vibrates to let you know your about to hit something. Three bad reasons are: the cars can malfunction and cause serious damage to the car and the person in it, the brakes can automatically stop working and cause serious damage to the car and the person in it, and in the passage it did not say whether the car had a GPS system or not so how would the car know where were going.

I am with the Driverless Cars because we dont have to pay any money for them It's like a taxi. They let us know when were to close to another car when backing up, they accelerate, steer, and brake themselves. It also saves fuel.

I am not with the Driverless Cars because they can easily malfunction and put a adult/child in danger. It doesnt have a childs lock for children under 7, the brakes can easily be tampered with and stop working automatically, so therefore if the brakes were to be tampered with and the car was still going it could put an adult/child in serious danger.

But then again if i am with the Driverless cars I just hope the patrons in the car are safe and enjoy their ride.
