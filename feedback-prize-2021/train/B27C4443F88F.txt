dear principal okay so we should be able to have our phones on us in the day if they are on slight mod because if something happen to some one in our family some one needs to get hold of us some how. we should be able to text in lunch because its not getting in the way of us learning cause we are not in class. then when we are in the hall we should be able to again its not getting in the way of us learning cause we are not in class. but if you take it out in class then they should take it but if it has to do with some one that is heart or something they shouldn't be able to do talk them cause you have the right to know what is going on. or if we are all done with our work and it about time to leave for the next class we should be able to text. or if its up to our teachers should be able to decide if we can text in there class or not.
