WOAH! Boom! Sir I'm so sorry I was on my phone and not paying attention to the road sir. Texting and driving isn't for anyone it's one of the fastest ways to end your life over one of the smallest things and we don't want that to happen. These are a few reasons texting and driving will ruin your life, drivers lose all awareness on the road and not paying attention, they lead to more crashes, and you're most likely to be at fault during an accident.

Texting is all throughout today's society like being at fault during accidents. When you're at fault for an accident it makes your insurance premium go up and nobody wants to pay extra just over a ticket. You will be the liable victim and you will need an accident lawyer and just to pursue a lawsuit. However it may be legal in some states it's really not the best option.

Suddenly you're driving down the street your girlfriend texts you and it's a serious emergency but youre on the highway going at a speed of 80 youre ruined. You just made your death wish there is no saving you just call it quits. Then did you know driving at speeds at 55 mph or above you can cover the length of a football field. Just keep the text message unread people can wait.

Nobody wants their life ruined over something so little and it's just not worth it not at this age, just live your life its better to be on unread than dead. Seriously!
