Dear Principal,

I think it is unfair to the students who make a C average not to be able to participate in sports.

If they don't do any work at all and you say they can't try out for a team then I understand, but some people do try hard on their school work but don't always make high grades.

If they have a C average they should still be able to try out for the team.

If they are not doing any work while on the team then they should be removed but if they are trying but can't get high grades they should still be allowed.

To make a B average is kind of hard for some students because they may need extra help that they cannot get but a C average would be good because that is where most people have their averages at.

If during their sport the students grade drops then you should warn them once and if their grades are still dropping after the warning then they should be removed off the team.

I think when looking at students grades you shouldn't just look at their average.

Look and see if they do their work.

Then see if they pay attention in class then check to see if they get in trouble a lot.

I think that is a good way to see if a student should be allowed to try out for a team instead of just looking at their average.

So in some cases I agree that students with a C average or lower shouldn't be allowed to try out for a team but that is only if they goof off, get in trouble, and don't do their work.

For students with a grade C average or maybe lower that try hard, pay attention in class, and do all their work they should be allowed to try out for the team.

Like I said earlier if they make the team but begin to slack off in class then they should be warned once, but if it keeps happening then they should be removed from the sport.

That is all I have to say about this topic.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
