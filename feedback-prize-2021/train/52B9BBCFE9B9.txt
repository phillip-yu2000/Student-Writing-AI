Driverless cars are coming! my opinion on the driverless cars is i agree with them. I think that it would be a good idea for them to make them work rather than us drivering around the car could be driving instead of us. I think that it is a good idea because some peopole do not evne know how to drive and what if they have an emergeny. They wont be able to drive no where because they dont know how to drive but if they had the car to drive them around we wouldnt have this problem with them.

Thier could be less crashes if they do have a car that drives by it self i thinik that it would be a great idea for doing this. Acoording to the article it says that cars have been driven more han half a million miles with out a crash but so far Google cars are not truly driverless they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with compliacted traffic issues such as nagivating through roadwork or accidents. Thier are differnet types of cars and companys that have a different way of doinjg stuff. Like General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. If they was a car just like this i think that thir would be more people out in the streets driveing around and go out more than it useed to be but things could be different if they wouldnt let it be.

We would porbably have more popluation than it used to be because of how much it would change the fact that people could go out with more even though they dont have to walk anywere now. i agree with this because of how accurate it is to be walking around and be in a car and not risk our lifes being worried of gettin ran over or in a different accident.
