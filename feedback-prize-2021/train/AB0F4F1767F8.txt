In the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus", the author does a terriable job on supporting the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represents.

The author doesn't really inclued what good would come out of the expedition to Venus. The author talks about how Venus seems to have alot in common with Earth, "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth". The author is guessing what Venus might've had on its planet, he doesn't know if they Venus did or didn't, he is just taking the information that "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters." The author took what he knows and can see and tried to guess that there was water and life forms there, but was guessing. Despite what the author thinks what is on Venus or what is on Venus, the dangers are very real. Many reasons why people have never gone to Venus is because "no spacecraft survieved the landing for more than a few hours".

The author has multiple reasons on why it's very dangerous to go on expeditions to Venus. The author provides the reader with more dangerous examples than the good it will bring Earth on why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, therefore the author does a terriable job on supporting his Venus pursuit idea.
