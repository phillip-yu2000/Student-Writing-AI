I'm strongly against with have driveless cars,the chance of having car accident are higher,technology has arrived but not fully fuction,and the cost for driverless car.

The chance of a accidents are higher. "Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"Drivers will have to be alert to any happening."Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?",This lead Drivers most like falling sleep or more like geting distract from the feedom of useing hands lead to texting or active invole using your hands. Drivers will not have enough time to respond to take over car. Which leds to next problem technology.

Technology has arrived but not fully fuction. Technology has adavance some much in little amount time. What took developers decades to do in the past. will take developers today a matter of months at most. but we still have problems beacuse, technology has adavance some much we have to face new problems."Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."Although we have driverless cars today it require a human.

The cost if driverless car. the car will cost a fourtue."For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."it took years to develop and technology in the car. the coverage for driveless cars most be expenisve beacuse of cost car and the danger it brings."order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"

Reasons why i strongly against with have driveless cars,the chance of having car accident are rise,technology has arrived but not fully fuction,and the cost for driverless car.
