To the principle:

I strongly believe that the policies that you are considering are both great policies for a school, but I lean more towards policy number one. You may ask yourself why i support this policy more than policy number two.

Well, I support policy number one more because if you don't allow students to have phones at school at all, then that will just trigger something in their minds that says "You can't bring your phone to school, I won't get caught so I'll just take my phone to school" or " If I can't have my phone, how am I going to let my parents know that something may have happened, well I guess I'll should just take it just in case of an emergency."

I support policy one because lunch and other free times is the only time that students get to socialize with others and why not socialize with friends or family that they don't see often? This will allow students to know that going to school can be somewhat fun. I also support this policy because it will help the parents know if their kids are going to school because some phones may have a GPS to track their student's activity. If the student doesn't have their phone then it can cause their parents to worry possibly leave work to check if their child is or isn't in school. This policy will also give students a chance to call or text their parents tell them if they may have forgotten something important and ask if they could bring it to the student during school so the student wont have to turn something in for half credit.
