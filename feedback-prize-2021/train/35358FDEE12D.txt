In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author has many good points. The author talks about Venus and why we should explore it. They point out that, despite the dangers, it is worth it. They have many good points behind their claim and even have some ideas that many scientists have about exploring Venus.

The author brings up the point that silicon carbide has been tested in Venus's surface conditions and has survived for three weeks. They also bring up the fact that machines made of gears and levers that don't require electronics can be made more resistant to pressure and heat. They also brought up the fact that scientists have thought of making a blimp-like vehicle hovering above the landscape on Venus can solve our problem of not having to land on Venus to escape the choas of the ground conditions. The only flaw in their plan though is that we would not be able to see through the atmosphere, with pictures or eyes, because it is so dense.

While the author brought up many good claims on why we should explore Venus's surface, they're still not fully great or perfect ideas and need some help. The ideas have some flaws, which the author points out. Although most of their plans are good ones and could probably work though. I think the author made good points to get me to want Venus explored despite the dangers too.
