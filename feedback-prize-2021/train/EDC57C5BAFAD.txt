What is the point of driving a car now and days anyways? In VAUBAN, Germany even soccer moms gave up their car. Paris even bans car driving Due the smog. In BOGOTA, Colombia has a program that they wants to go worldwide. Let talk about Vauban, Germany you can't park on the street, in your own driveway nor your home garages are forbidden. Vanban is completely "Car Free". At first I really thought that was a joke but its not. Downtown they are allowed to have car ownership. What sense does that make. If the car owner buys a space for $40,000, and plus the new home. 70 precent of Vauban familes do not own cars. But 57 percent sold their car to move to Vauban. Vanban completed in 2006. 5,500 residents in Vauban. Think about it most people in Vauban dont have cars. Now lets get on to Paris... Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday's motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or pay a fine of $31 dollars, same thing goes for the odd numbered plates. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people  had their car inpounded for the reaction to how much the fine was. Car traffic was down too 60% . 5 days after intensifying the smog. Diesel fuel was blammed. Diesel makes 67% of vehicles in France.
