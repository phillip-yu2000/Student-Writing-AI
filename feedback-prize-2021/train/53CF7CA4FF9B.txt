I think that all students whether they have a b average I think that they should be able to partake in after school sports or in any thing else that the school is doing like dances and other things like that. The students who have a C average should also be able to go on school trips and be on a list for people who cannot go at all. The other students who get B averages think that students who get C averages are not as smart as they are. The students who have C averages also think that they cannot get anything higher than a C. The students who get B averages tell the students who get a C average that they cannot get any higher than a C as well. So I think that students who get a C average should still be able to partake in after school stuff. So I think that the students who have a C average can try harder and get a B.
