This picture on the right shows more and more detail as the years go by. It starts to get more and more focused when the cameras improve. This is one of the reasons why it can't be aliens.

As you see, throught the years, the world has devolped better technology. We've made better cameras and have found out a way to make things even more clear. In 1976, the picture appears blurry. It doesnt look focused on it at all. So what I am trying to say is, that this could not have been clear at first and that they didn't know what they were seeing at first. It could have been there the whole time.

The texts states what the picture actually shows. It says, "what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West." This is a landform. Garivn states that it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. People have seen this types of landforms on Earth too, and there is no aliens on Earth. they have said it's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.

In the text, it says that scientists figured it was just another Martin mesa. They even said it was common around that area, Cydonia. The only thing that was different was, that it had shadows around it. That is completly normal for shadows to appear.

According to the research I have learned, I believe that this was not made by aliens. I believe, that this is a landform. There is no scienitifict proof that an alien had decided to make this. There is no actual evidence.
