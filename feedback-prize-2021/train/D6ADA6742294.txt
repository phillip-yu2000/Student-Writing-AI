In the article, "Making Mona Lisa Smile", I learned thet computers can now feel what emotions that you are feeling. This is a really cool thing cause now we can see and know when someone is actually happy or not. We could have so much more uses for this then trying to guess what emotions someone is feeling.

I think that this type of technology is actually very useful, my reasons for that come from the article when the author tells about how using a special camera can detect when someone is becoming bored when doing homeowrk or doing someother type of school work on the computer. If you can tell when comeone is confused or bored then you could really get some help or get a better, more fun filled math questions. Than would make students more productive and want to actually learn rather then when you are bored and doing ISTEP, they can make the test more exciting.

But there could also be some down fall to it. When a computer is watching your while your on it then that could be really weird feeling for some people. Also when a computer is seeing your facial expression all the time you could just be talking to someone and the computer would think your not getting what ever your doing so then it would have a tutor come up when you dont even need one.

So in my conclusion I think that these emotion reading computer cameras could not be so good but in other cases could be really handy or even in some events save you from getting a bad grade on a test. But in all I do believe that if these were to come into our schools I would just hope one thing, and that is to be graduated befor that time comes.
