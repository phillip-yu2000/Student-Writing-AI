TEACHER_NAME I think you should let the grade average for sports to be at least a c. the reasons are people that play sports have a lot of work to do they have to do school work practice for sports and they mite have to do chores at their house. They have lots of fun in sport a lot of people mite get kicked out of sports and not have fun at school as much. Kids will have time more after school to hangout with friends. My last reason is if less people play sports less people representing the school.

If kids at the school already have a lot of work to do then when you add on the higher grade's its just making them struggle even more. who knows they mite have problems at home. play sports to get away from them. they already have school grades to keep up to a c even when they don't worry about that they have to worry a lot on sports if they want to make the cut.

I think if people get kicked out of sports they will probably be sad and wont care about there grades anyways. i know i probably would be. If they are already depressed about something else you should add gas to the fire. so if you would just leave it a c it would help them a lot.

If we have less people in our sports then we have less people representing our school and making us know. i hope this helped you change your mind. I really like hearing and watching all the sports so please reconsider your decision.

If we have less kids in sport cause of grades less happy kids and more depressed kids. so hope this essay helped you change your mind. sincerely,
