Do you enjoy sports? Do you enjoy other activities outside of school? I think that students should be required to join at least one extracurricular activity because the student could potentially have a better time at finding a career, it may help them with academics, and it can give the student something to do.

One reason is that it would help students pursue a career that they may want in the future. Maybe a student would like to go for a career that school doesn't teach. An example would be a photographer. If the student enjoys sports, they could join a sports team to get better at it and know more on that sport. If the student wants to do a profession that includes music or instruments, then an extracurricular class could help them achieve that.

Another reason why an extracurricular class might assist a student is that it could help the students with education. If a student is having a hard time in class, they may want to join an academic activity so that it could help them. It would give the student a better working habit and help them strengthen their memory. They could also use the activity for studying for a quiz or test.

The final reason is that it would give the students something to do and they may find it enjoyable. The activity can range from sports, to an instrument, and to an academic activity. Many students go home and they don't have anything to do, so they could join an activity. Many people say that students should be able to choose what they would like to do, but I believe that at least one extracurricular class would help students a lot.

Therefore, students should join an extracurricular for educational help, gives the students something to do, and helps them with their career in the future. Extracurricular activities can benefit a child a lot. So I agree with my principle that all students must be in a extracurricular activity.
