I strongly disbelieve that the face on mars was created by aliens. I do not think that there is alien existence out there. This claim was made 20 years ago when we saw pictures of the faces. I think that it is just an natural landfrom. Evidence say that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.

The ''Face on Mars'' was an pop icon. It started a hollywood flim, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery checkout lines almost 25 years. On Apirl 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydoina for the first time, Micheal Malin and his MOC(Mars Orbiter Camera) team take an picture 10x sharper than the original photos. Thousands of web suffers were waiting to see if it was alien existence. On an JPL website it revealed that the picture was an natural landform...no alien monument after all.

I conclude that there is no alien monument among us. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms around the American West. ''It reminds me of most Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho'', says Gravin.''Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated messa about the same height as the Face on Mars''.
