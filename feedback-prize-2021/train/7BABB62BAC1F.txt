I Think you should join the program if you like cowboys and the sea. it will fit you perfectlyyou can tell Luke really wanted to be a SeaGoing Cowboy because when his friend asked do you want to come with me he could'nt say no. And you know he likes it because when he cracked his ribs he just got right back to work in a few days. And if you do Seaging before you go to the army you have a better chance of being in the army.

If you become a seagoing Cowboys you can have a little bit of fun like playing Baseball,Volleyball,Boxing,and Table-tennis. Also if you become a seagoing Cowboy you will go on alot of aventures. And If you become a Seagoing Cowboy you can tell your family all about the Great Adventure you had and you whould know alot about the sea and cows ect,.And if you jion the Seagoing Cowboys you whould how how you should be greatful about your stuff because people in diffent Countries dont have alot of stuff and the food you have.
