Imagine that your going through a tough time and you want some advice .Who would you go to and ask for help? ,Would you go to more than one person ?Getting more than one opinion can help you make a better choice because you can get more than one perspective of the situation and you could compare and contrast your opinions with others and make a better choice.

When I was going through a tough time when my mom told me we were moving I was very sad,because just the thought of me leaving my friends again made me sad I didnt want to leave. I've felt this way before ,because growing up we moved a lot so i was kind of used to it but this time I made very close friends who I didnt want to leave .After talking to my dad about it he told me I could move in with him,my step mom ,and my half sister. I thought about moving in with my dad and thought how it could be a great opportunity to have some disaplince in my life. I also talked about it with my mom and she said that it would be a great opportunity to make new friends and open up a bit She also said that I would see my god mother and god brothers more often who which I care about very much. I also talked about it with some close friends and they told me that I should stay and move in with my dad ,because they know that I would miss them too much and that it would be a great opportunity to get more emotionally closer with him and that I could go vast my mom and other half sister on her days off just like i would do with my dad. I finally had the time and revise to myself and asked my self "what do i want to do?.who should I stay with?". I looked at it in many different ways and i compared there perspectives with others and decided to stay with my dad. I now go visit my mom on her days off .

In conclusion I think getting ore than one opinion can help you make a better choice,because you can get more than one perspective and you can compare and contrast there opinions. Thank you for your time have a wonderful day.
