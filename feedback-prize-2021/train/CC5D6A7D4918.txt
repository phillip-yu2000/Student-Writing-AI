Dear, State Senator

I am arguing in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I think that this would be an approvement. I know that our founding fathers established it in the Contutution but that was a long, long time ago. I just feel like its unfair.

Under the electoral college system they vote for a slate of electors,who elect the president. I feel like that is a long chain of people, and it really doesnt need to be there. I dont understand why the popular vote that a candidate gets doesnt make them president.

Thats like if you were in a school talent show and got the popular vote from your peers but the teachers they vote for the other person and they ended up winning when theres clearly more peers then teachers. Isnt that kind of unfair? Do you see it know?

I dont think some people understand that when they vote for the presidential cadidate they're acutally voting for a slate of electors. I kind of feel like they are being tricked and thats not fair.

I also dont think its fair how a candidate could have more popular votes, but have less electoral votes they could lose if their apponent had more electoral votes. I dont understand how thats logically fair?...that because its

NOT
