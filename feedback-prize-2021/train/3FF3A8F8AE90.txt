In a student enviorment this technology would help teachers understand what problems the student is having on a particular problem or lesson. Is it not part of learning, for students to ask the teacher for help? Also it would be difficult for every school system to encorperate this technology into there computers in order to make there lessons better for that student.

On one side of the argument, this technology could prove useful for teachers and students alike. For students it could make the lesson easier to understand and then the students would understand the material and be better a what ever subject they were stuck on. Then for the teachers it would be easier for them because then the teacher could help that particular student who is struggling to learn this new subject and teach them a different way that maybe would seem easier to that student. This is evident in paragraph 6 when it says "A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored and figure out a new lesson or modify it

On the oppisite end, this technology could not help the students or teachers at all because the teacher does not use computers or the system gave the student and different way but it seems harder than the last, then the teacher would have to find and entire new way to help this student learn this topic.

But then again, this new technology could end up being very beneficial to both the student and the teacher by giving the student and easier time to learn the topic and the teacher and easier time to teach the topic that the student or the entire class is struggling with it. Also this technology for better or worse would help teachers learn what that student is struggling in without the student even telling the teacher

So in conclusion, this technology would help both the students and teachers by giving the teachers a helping hand on what subject he/she really needs to work on, and it would help the student by giving an easier time learning the topic with a new method
