Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My opinion is that I think that we should not have cell phones at school because they are a distraction. I do not think cell phone should be allowed because eve though students say they will put them away in class they will not do so. Here are some good reasons: one they are a distraction and kids really don't need cell phones unless they are minute phones for emergencies, two we came to school to learn not to play all day on cell phones, last I think that we should not even have cell phones on campus unless they are off and inside our backpacks! Even if you let kids have there cell phones on campus do you really think kids will put them away when they are supposed to? And this will also cause more drama with students. Anyways that is my opinion and I hope you agree with me on this but if not at least I got to tell you my opinion anyways.

your loving student,
