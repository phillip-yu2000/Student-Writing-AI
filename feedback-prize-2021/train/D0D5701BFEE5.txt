The face on Mars is often a very controversial subject. People often think that NASA is hiding something about it from the entire world,and that is alien life. The idea that this is a real alien landform has been proven wrong and wrong again, so why do people still gravitate toward it?

The poor quality cameras back in 1976 are nothing compared to the ones in 2001. There are photos of the landform from 2001 that make it look nothing like a face. The most recent photos have been taken on a cloud less day, with the resolution up as far as it would go. This means that the photo was as sharp as it possibly could be. If there were any small structers next to the landform, you could also see those.

There is a preconcieved notion that NASA is hiding the discovery that the face is alien made. Why would NASA want to hide it though? If there was alien life on Mars, NASA could gain a lot of money from the publicity. Think about it, NASA could gain so much from proving that that land form is ,in fact, alien made.

In conclusion,the fact that the famous face on mars is an alien made landform, has been almost completely busted. There are too many things going against it. With the better quality cameras, and the fact that NASA would actually get money if it was alien made, has proven this conspiracy theory wrong.
