I think that not letting students participate in sports and other activities because they don't have a B average is a bad idea for several reasons. One reason why i think students should be able to participate in sports and other activities even if they don't have a B average is because many students enjoy playing sports and its a great way for them to support there school and have fun. Another reason why i think taking away sports from people who don't have a B average is a bad idea is because for some students school is hard and most students don't get B averages a lot of students get a C averages and its harder for them to learn all different subjects when they already learned how to play all different sports. M y final reason why i think taking away sports from students who don't have a B average is that school sports is a good after school activity that attracts a big audience and keeps the students active and having fun.

Many students participate in after school activities it is a great way for the to socialize and connect with there fellow classmates. After school activities also show that many students have a passion for the same thing its shows they have something in common with each other. After school activities is also a great way to make new friends and a great way to interact with other students.

Another reason why after school activities are a good thing to have is because some students may have parents that get off work late and its a good way for them to have fun with there friends after school without getting in trouble. This also lets parents know that there children are safe.

Whether your in a club or you enjoy playing sports these after school activities are a great way for students to interact, socialize, or just fun at school.
