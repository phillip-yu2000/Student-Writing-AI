in my opinion using technology to detect if someone is happy is way to overrated for the subtle classroom. most teacers can tell if someone i shappy or little bit sad or completely sad it doesnt need facial coding to describe how someone is feeling at the oment in the time. Some people coud use it to detect it in other studies as in this case on a painting. but to detect someone emotions you dont need technology to describe what normal humans can detect in a person just by looking at them. i could help in a classroom but not on other students or in real life people. if they were examing emotions like foor a therapy class it could work. they could look at a picture and try to desribe what they think that person is emotions are and what that person is feeling. and then use the facial coding to describe it and ifigure it out and grade the students on how close they scored to the emotions and if they scoreed the right ones and percentages. facial coding could help in classroom but only in certain cases where describing someoens emotions come into play and help them describe what that person is felling.

In conclusion facial coding could work in a classroom as long as the class is learning facial expressions and how to detect people emotions. in other cases no it shouldnt be in a classroom that isnt design for those special classes.
