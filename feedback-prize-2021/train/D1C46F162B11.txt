I disagree because what if thay cant do it because of what thay got to do at home. It depends if thare is a bus to take you home or not.

I think it wood be a good idea but if thare is no ride to get home or thay cant do it i think thay shude have a coise to do it or not. Maby thay can have a fun razear or maby thay can do some after scool program like to help pepl in need or to raze money.

we can make a scool garden or a flower gardean and sertan pepl can take care of the flowers and swich one a wile.

Thare can be a in scool pro gram but thay can do it only if thay are in a eletev so what im saying make it a thing that thay can do it in scool that is what i think thay can do but the can do more if thay wont to.

Maby thay can make a pro gram whare thay can do all those thing but on diffrent day like 5 things for 5 day do do all to show them how to grow crops or make a flawer garden. Thay can make robots like teknolgy but after scool like make them work maby try some difrent parts or difrent shaps.
