Regargless of whether this should or should not be used to read the emotional expressions of students, this technology is very advanced. It is so impresive that computers are being evovled to understand us even more. When it comes to students, im sure many of us get distracted or bored very easily when it domes to school work. Having this tecnology in our computers could help us complete school with out having to worry about not understanding wht going on or how to do things or even if you just don't care. This tecnology can help students all over in many different ways.

A simple senario, a student is at home doing school work. The student doesn't understand the lesson and therfor can not complete the work simply because they do not know how. If the computer detects that the student is confused then it can sugest help. This help could be a instructive website over the work or a direct contact with the teacher of this class. It doesn't do the work for them but it can provide opportunities.

Same senario except the student is doing schoolwork on a program that is directly hooked up to the face recongnition program. The computer recognizes that the student is getting bored of the wokr and can either sugest a new work load, or just change the questions/work for the student.

Overall this technology should be used in classroms and school work because it can provide help for the student. This technology doesn't really have any side affect other then a better graduation and or completion rate. This advancment needs to be put into action.
