According to The National Safety Council, "the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year".

My opinion is that they should not be able to use cell phones in any situation while operating a vehicle. I think this for multiple reasons such as they can get into an accident, they could harm someone else, and they could easily take a life out of this world.

My first reason why I think they should not be allowed to use cell phones is because it could lead to a car accident with someone else. For example, on the News 24 website the driving states this, ""I was trying to get my phone on the bed behind me. It was ringing. I did this while I was driving. I'm sorry about this I should have stopped the truck." This shows that many people don't think about their surroundings within the reality and rather have their phones.

My second reason why is because they could harm someone else. It is proven that nearly 390,00 injuries happen during accidents that involve the use of cell phones. For example, an article on livestrong. com states , "traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for American teens, and when it comes to distracted driving, young people are among the most likely to text and talk behind the wheel." This proves that many accidents harm other people when the collision happens or within the next few days after the collision.

While some may say they need it for if their family is having an emergency and they had to make a quick phone call, you should still need to think about others and your surroundings and not just yourself.

Today, many states within the United States are making it a law to drive with a phone in your hand and can take you to court and write you a ticket for driving with a phone in your hand. Do you want to be in an accident with someone who was on their phone?
