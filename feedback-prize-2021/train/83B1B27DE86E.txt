The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If this was a Face, Nasa would've been benefited more. Nasa has more proof that the Face is a natural landform.

This formation is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The shadows made the landform look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. The Face is a huge rock formation. If this formation was an actual face, Nasa would have benefited and earned money for their discovery of life on Mars. I also state that "a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars." The Face of life on Mars is compared more times to a natural landform than a face of a Martain. These "Faces"

are common around Cydonia. After long, eighteen years after the Viking missions had ended, our Mars Global Surveyor arrived at Mars in September 1997. We took photographs the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. The photo was ten times sharper than the other and we coud get a better view of the Face and it was just a rock landform and not an alien monument. Our cameras are very good quality and you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. We got a fantastic look at this so called "Face".

In conclusion, this Martain Face is just a natural landform on Mars. Shadows give of an illusion of a face and Nasa has discovered that there is no Martain activity linked to the Face. Many people believed there was once life on Mars because of this incident but in reality there is no alien monument after all.
