I believe driving should be in the hands of humans along with the assistance of a machine.

Having autonomous care can enbale us to do different things while driving.

With the extra control over the car, we can make the roads safer while we multi-task on the road.

Semi- autonomous cars can help us get to a hospital if we are sick or injured and are unable to drive.

If a parent needs to take care of a child in the backseat, she can reach back and take care of the child without having to worry about the road as well.

These systems can also teach people how to drive behind the wheel; and if there is a problem, the car can take control and keep others safe as well as the driver.

Kids that are working to get their liscense could have more experience driving alone since the system in the car is there to help in case of a problem.

But that wont completely destroy the purpose of needing a liscense to drive becasue people will still need to know how to drive since the car is not always in full control.

In conclusion, fully automated cars may not be the best thing due to their inability to judge and react to situations.

Semi- autonomous vehicles can assist us in the vehicle, but can still be controlled with our quick reactions in case of a problem.

Instead of giving all control to the machine, the driver and the car should work together to preserve the safety of themselves and others around them.
