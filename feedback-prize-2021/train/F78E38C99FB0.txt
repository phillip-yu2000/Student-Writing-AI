I think that driverless cars would be useless, the reason that I think this is because "Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?" Most people( mostly teenagers) like to go joyriding with there friends or just drive around town to blow off some steam.

Another reason that I believe that driverless cars are a bad idea is because what is the user of the car falls asleep and doesnt awaken whenever the car alerts them that they need to take over in a potentially dangoures situation. "In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

This means the driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when there is a possibly dangours situation. These necessitates of the the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs."

Another reason is that these vehicals could be extermly costly for the consumer's. All the technology that will be needed to be placed into this car will be costly not only for the company but will also be for the customers. There are also many problems with these cars considering that we do not have all the tech needed for them, Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

In conclusion I believe that driverless cars should not be mass produced.
