If you asked any student to teach the current class subject is, the lesson would not be smooth or effective. However, if the teacher was to teach the subject, the lesson would be smooth and effective. The same goes for summer projects. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers have an elevated understanding of the curriculum and have more experience with learning based projects, which make the projects more effective.

Firstly, teachers have more of an understanding of the curriculum because it is their job to plan and teach it to the students. Therefore, teachers have the ability to create a project that studies important or nuanced portions of their subject. Backed with superior expertise, the teacher's project will be better at guiding students towards understanding important topics. The teacher's better understanding of the curriculum will allow them to create a project that not only explores the surface of the topic, but one that can delve into the finer details.

Secondly, teachers have more experience teaching new subjects and topics to their students. Teachers understand the methods to teach students their subject because they have experience with the subject and teaching. Their experience allows them to create projects that present a topic in a manageable and understandable manner.

Proponents of student designed projects may argue that student designed projects will make students more passionate about the project. Although students may be more passionate, the construction of the project will be less efficient and lack teacher expertise, which may lead to failures in the project's effectiveness.

A teacher's superior subject understanding and teaching experience will lead to a better and more effective project than one built from a student's understanding and lesser teaching experience; summer projects should be designed by teachers.
