Dear Principle,

I understand that some students do not like or want to do community service for reasons their own. I think that making it a requirement to do community service is a very bad idea.

We should not make community service a requirement on the students because it will have most wanting to go to another school because they can do community service on their own time, students will purposely miss school so they can have the option for community service, you will most likely get a lot of complaint letters from parents and that can be very dangerous.

My first reason for this not being a good idea is students can do community on their own time because community service is volunteer work not demanded work from people. If some people do it and some people don't oh well, they don't have to do it if they want to . most students like me don't have very much free time because of school and family work and business issues.

Secondly, students will miss school for other things like friends and home.

and most of all students don't like getting told what to do because this is our life and we want to live it with people and they can choose community service they choose. If at school there is a threat parents will make sure the student doesn't come to school.

Last but not least, you will receive mail of some sort from parents and they will be very colorful at least most of them will be. If they were from my mom they defiantly will be like that and a few more things will be said that will be very mean.

so I would not even try the requirement of community service.

I conclude that if you make a requirement of community service you are in for lots of trouble!
