Dear Senator,

The Electoral College was established by our founding father, put into the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens, as stated by The Office of the Federal Register. The process consists of a selection of electors who then vote for for the President along with the vice president. I argue in favor of this process in which we have been using for awhile now. Although the process may be faulted at times to work as we have elected 44 presidents under it. Reasons to favor this process of voting consists of the certainty of outcome it holds, along with every vote feeling counted.

The certainty of Outcome is a very important principle when it comes to voting. As Richard A. Posner says on his works of the issue " less likely than a dispute over the popular vote." Posner is explaining that dispute over the Electoral College has could but is unlikely compared one of the popular vote. Again as Posner is sourced he states, " A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the the total number of votes-538-is an even number",he goes on to state the unlikely ness of this happening. With popular vote to many risks would be taken.

With this process every voter may not feel like there vote is being counted, but they are mistakend. With there system every vote is able to be expressed in some way. As The Office of the Federal Register has stated how the electors are chosen and how they are able to vote. Through this we are able to see each vote being accounted. Then the majority being the one to choose the vote. The process works in choosing the president.

Although the Electoral College isn't the best system, it works for us. As Americans we have the right to vote and this is one of the principles following that right.
