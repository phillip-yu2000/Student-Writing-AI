Are driverless cars a good idea? Are these cars a postive invention for our world today? Driverless cars can help our lives in so many aspects and make our world better. The development of these cars will bring more safety to drivers, prevent accidents, and also use less fuel.

Driverless cars will make driving safer for the driver. The cars will help the driver to avoid texting while driving. The manufacturers will lessen the texting while driving issues by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays, helping the driver pay more attention to the road and things happening around them. The driver will be more aware of what is happening on the roads, rather than paying attention to cell phones.

The development of these cars will also prevent accidents. Google's Toyota Prius, for example, uses a spinning sensor on the roof. The sensor uses laser beams to make a constantly updating 3-D model of everything around the car. This can help the driver be aware of things surrounding their automobile, such as other cars, animals, or pedestrians. With the help of this sensor, drivers will see more things surrounding them, preventing accidents. Google's cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash.

Lastly the driverless cars will consume less fuel. This will reduce prices for drivers and make a more eco-friendly enviornment. The world is often trying to come up with solutions to use less fuels. The development of this vehicle would take a step in helping the eco-friendliness of our world.

Using driverless cars will be a postive improvement to our world. The cars will make the roads more safe for drivers, help prevent accidents, and conserve fuel. In conclusion, the development of driverless cars are a great advancement to our world and help our day-to-day lives.
