Responsible Drivers

The share of American adults that own smartphones is now 81%, up from just 35% in pew research center. Most of the 81% is responsible adults around the United States, so that means they are responsible enough to know how to use a phone in a car. I think that should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Drivers should be able to use phones while driving the car because, now a days there is a Bluetooth in cars that most drivers can connect their phone in once they have gotten in. Once that happen people can answer the phone without picking up their cell phone and having to hold it up to their ear, instead it will just sound off through the car.

Another reason I think that drivers should be able use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because, many people do follow the rules and not answer the phone and not text while driving but, what if it what an emergency that has occurred but, people don't want to answer the phone because they don't want to get caught. People should be able to pick up a phone during an emergency because, if it were a family emergency, I would want to pick up the phone up as soon as possible.

Overall my understanding would be that People should be able to use cell phones while driving, not many people would say it's safe but when it comes down to being responsible, I think people like that, that know how to manage their time on the phone and as cautious as could be , with a Bluetooth speaker in their car would be good source to use instead of having to pick up the phone and having to put it up to your ear in making it notice , but if you are as responsible as people who know how not to pick up a phone you should try using Bluetooth in your car for you can start using it.
