I believe that the principal should go with policy one and allow students to have cell phones at school. Yes i think that you should let kids have cell phones at school and no do i think they should be allowed to use in class. Students should be allowed to have cell phones but only during lunch or there free period. I agree that the cell phones need to be turned off in class so it does not distract students from there school work. Teenagers will enjoy school more if they are allowed cell phones in school. Now if the texting begins to be a problem in class then i think you should take away the rule and allow no cell phones in school. But i doubt it will be a problem since teenagers love there cell phones and do not want them taken away. Teenagers like to communicate over text so if one doesn't know where the other is then the can text each other and get together. Another reason is that students will need to call parents or other students to get a ride home or if the parent is late picking them up they can call them and know where they are and why there late without worrying about getting there phones confiscated.

Well that sums up why i think you should allow students to have cell phones.
