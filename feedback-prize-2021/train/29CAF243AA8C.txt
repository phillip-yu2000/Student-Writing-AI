I agree with this because, you can spend more time at school, this can be helpful, and this can be successful.

I agree because, you get more time at school. You get to see your friends more. If you see your friends more you get to hangout with them longer. You get to see your teachers more. If you see your teachers more you can get more help. You can bring your grades up. If you bring your grades up you can be successful. This is why I agree to get more time at school.

I agree because, it can be successful. You can get help from teachers. If your grades are low and you want to get them up you can talk to your teachers. You can help other students. If you help other students that can make them successful. You can help teachers. If you help teachers that can make them be more successful. This is why I agree on this being successful.

I agree on this being helpful. You can have an activity thats about technology. This can help in the future because if something is wrong in your house you can fix it. You can have a cooking activity. This can help because if your mom is not at home yet then you can help her make dinner. You might be in a sports activity. This can help for the future because if you want to teach sports you can teach it to little kids. This is why I agree on this being helpful.Â
