I find the ideas behind the electoral college extremely ridiculous, and my claim is completely justifiable and backed up. Why vote for some one if youre actaully only voting for a board of people who could possibly not vote for the canidate of your choice. There also always a chance of your canidate winning popular vote and still losing to electoral. There is also the idiotic winner take all system that most states have in place. This "winner take all" system means that if a canidate recieves a majourity of the states votes, they get all of the votes for that state.

I find it irrational because if you're going vote for a board of members who may or may not vote for the person in which you are rooting for, why even vote ? While this possability is extremly low, There is still always a chance it may happen.

The way the voting system is set up your canidate can win popular vote by 20% more than their opponent and still lose by a 5% lower score in electoral vote. There have been cases in which this happened as well. (i. e. Al Gore, Richard Nixon)

My final point against the Electoral College is the winner take all system states use when it comes to voting. This sytem makes it so that as long as there is a majourity in a state, the person that has that majourity has all the votes for the state.

Some counterclaims that state that we should keep the electoral college enacted state that there will always be swing states. This means that instead of going to lots of states they go to the few states that they know could be pulled to either president.

Over all I find the current system of voting a total disgrace to our glorious country. Its ubfair, unjust and a complete mess. I believe that we should act imediately upon this system and shut it dwon as soon as possible.
