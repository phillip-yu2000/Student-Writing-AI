Today most humans own a cell phones and smart watches and we used them for all types of things like texting and calling or facetime if you have IPHONE or A IPAD now with android it's a whole different story I'm going to save that one for later in the essay

Cell phones and driving is a serious thing Nowdays cause one minute your alive and then next minute your dead all because of your cell phone people please put down the cell phones when you're driving or put it on the phone stand in your car or just keep it in your pocket untill you get to where you're go

Whenever you get to where you're going that's when you pull out your phone to do whatever you want to with it like text or call or facetime order something to eat with your phone go out with friends and family. Spend time with them and not your phone put your phone down for once and go outside take a walk clear your mind.

We as people should just put the phones down and clear our mind from social media and take walks and think about how life would be without phone's but we can't do that because we need our phone's to do work and to call people.
