I think that students would benfit from distance learning. Student's will be in there own safe space at home and feel more comfortable. Student's would focus more because there will be very little distractions. Student's could feel even more excited and happy about school because they can wake up to see that school is only one computer away. Student's that droped out or even left school could come back because of distance learning.

However some people might not aggre that distance learning is the best option. Distance learning could help with many things. Distance learning could help stop bullying and even physical attacks. Distance learning could even lower the sucide rate and decrease peer pressure. Distance learning could help and support so many causes including special ed or even kids with disablites.

So inclusion distance learning would be a better option for some student's because it can help many causes. Distance learning could help prepare more kids for the future. Distance learning can give hope back to kids that thought they were not gonna graduate. Distance learning could even help benfit kids with dislexya or kids with learning disablites. Distance learning could help and shape the kids of the future by making them brighter, stronger and be ready to learn. So yes i aggre that kids should attend classes from home and work to there best ablites.
