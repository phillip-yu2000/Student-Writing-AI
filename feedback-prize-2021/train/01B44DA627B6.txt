I think that it should be a grade c average cause half of the kids cant do will in there classes and some kids wont be able to do the sports or other activities cause some of them cant keep there grades up cause the stuff they do in there class are hard for them some kids can keep there grades up to a c and it will kinda be hard for some kids to keep it up above B and there probably wont be a lot of kids in sports cause they cant keep there grades at a B and some of the other activities probably wont a lot of people to cause they cant keep there grades up and i think it should be a c average cause keeping your grades up to a b will probably be hard for some kids and if there is smart people who don't like sports wont even sign up for it and if the smart people don't like the other activities there wont be anybody in the activities or in the sports and i think it should stay to a grade C average cause it will be hard keeping your grades up to a grade B so it should be a grade B average for everybody can sigh up and do the sports and other activities.
