Dear Principal,

I think it should be required that all students should perform community service because it is a very good thing that us as children should help others and the planet. If those that do attend are doing a good job at helping the planet and others. I think those who do help should clean up any mess thrown on the floor, on the road or just left somewhere. We can stop wasting water by turning off just a little bit of water dripping from the sink or shower head or even the water hose outside. We can do so much that can keep us active, healthy, and we would be doing a very good deed for the planet. Helping some younger children learn by tutoring them on a subject or teaching them how to help the community in doing community service. So i think that even just walking some dogs or helping an elderly cross streets is even just helping for the community. So i think that all students here and there should do community service it can be a good thing that some students will experience. It can even change some kids lives on how they help the community.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
