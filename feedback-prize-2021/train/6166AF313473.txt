Dear Principal,

What is community service to you? Is it something you absolutely have to do because someone told you that you have to, or is it a good service that you do out of the kindness of your heart? I don't know about you but i think that real true community service comes from the heart. This is why i do not think that a principal should tell you that you have to do community service for a grade but maybe he/she could nudge you in the right direction.

You shouldn't have to do service because someone has told you to because it is not service if you are forced into it or technically paid with a grade. As i said before it should be because you want to not because someone has told you to. You may think that it is alright to tell someone what they have to do because you think they need it. If they need it they will know deep down inside that they do.

I also believe that principals shouldn't get into their students personal lives, because some kids already have enough on their plate with homework, sports, clubs, etc. You may not even know that they work at a soup kitchen or help in a homeless shelter. There are many good Samaritans out there but they don't tell anyone because that would ruin it.

There are many good people in this world even if they don't do community service and that is why i believe that service should not be pushed onto kids heads. Principals may have power over them at school but they cannot decide for the students how to spend their free time. So you may not believe what i have said today but you might have, so i hope that i have made an impact on you today.
