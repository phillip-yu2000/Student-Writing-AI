Dear principle,

The purpose of this letter is to say which of the new policy for cell phones is a better selection for the school.

I believe that the first policy would be more effective. If you allow them to use cell phones at lunch they won't have to do it in class. This would be a big help so teens can pay attention more to their academics other than their friends on texts, which could raise grades and help them perform well on assessments.

The second reason why this would be a good strategy is because some parents like to keep in touch with tier kid after school. Some need it to contact their parents to get a ride home. if you do not allow phones it will make their lives at home harder than it already is. It won't settle with adults and parents will send their kids to school with phones anyway. This will only anger parents and wont help the school at all.

The new policy could make cafeteria's softer because some kids will be texting and not talking. This would make cafeteria workers happier too so it also affects the school staff as well. This proves why the first policy would work better than not letting phones in school at all.

sincerely,
