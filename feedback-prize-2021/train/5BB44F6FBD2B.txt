Dear principal,

I agree with your plan for this policy. First, I believe this will be a motivation for the C average students. Second, the students that do work hard can participate as a reward for working hard.

The first reason I agree is because the students that are getting lower grades that still want to do sports can look at this new policy as a motivation. Students may be getting a C or D or maybe even be failing more than a few classes. But these students still want to do sports. Because the are getting low grades, they cannot participate unless they work harder to get higher grades.

The second reason I highly suggest to enforce this policy is to reward the students that are already working hard. The students receiving high grades deserve privileges. Being able to play sports and other activities after school can be a privilege. This will also prove and show the other students what rewards they may receive by working hard.

Therefore, I believe you should change the school policy and raise the expectant grade level to a B average for students that would like to participate in sports and other activities.
