Driverless cars aren't always so great

My position in driverless cars is that I'm opposing them.

Even though Google cofounder Sergey Brin can, I'm not ready to put my life nor my family's life on the line even after years and years of people testing them and making the driverless cars 100% safe.

Electronics always mess up somewhere down the road, even 100% safe, so why trust a driverless car when it could mess up and put your whole family's life on the line.

In the text it say's that "Driver's need to stay alerted at all times" but why if this car is 100% safe, aren't we aloud to sit and talk to are family while we are on the move.

The text also stats that "If there is a wreck who's going to be the blame, the owner of the driverless car or the manufacturer" so why buy it if you might be the one to blame and not the manufacturer who made this 100% safe driverless car.

My points go to prove why I'm sticking to a car I can personally drive and not a car that's still not 100% safe on the road yet.

So I ask you, would you like to move on with the rest of the world and put your life and other people's lives at risk every day with a driverless car or a car that you can drive and help keep others safe.

Stay safe and go against the flow sometimes, could be for the best.
