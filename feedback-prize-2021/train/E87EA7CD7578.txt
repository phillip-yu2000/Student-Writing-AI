Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Do you believe that us students really have to do community service?

I believe that student should do community service. I believe that student should do community service because of the environment. I believe that we should all do community service because i think that if we all work together we will have a better environment. I

think that each and every one of us could participate in some community service to help. Maybe some of us could clean up beaches and maybe some of us could probably help elderly people or maybe some of us could even clean up the freeways if its needed.

Now, i believe that some of the kids here at school may not want to be part part of this community service. I think that some kids may think that they have better things to do than community service, but what is better than trying to make our environment cleaner and nicer? If i was chosen to help out the environment i would gladly help, because I want our community and our environment to look nicer and be nicer. Now i also do believe that some kids are lazy and would rather be at home,

watching T.V . But how do they expect our community and our environment to get cleaner if they're just sitting there not doing anything about it?

Now what places do i think need some cleaning up? I think that maybe the beaches, the lakes the freeways and maybe even community centers like parks and older people homes. I

think that if we maybe help clean up all of this we can have a better community and environment.
