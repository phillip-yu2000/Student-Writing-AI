Distractions while driving could lead to deaths of other civilians. There are reasons why this topic became an actual law. The law was just passed last year that is you're on your phone while driving, that is an immediate ticket. Due to your criminal record (if it's bad) you can even do jail time if you feel you do not apply to this law. The cops of our cities are doing their job by stopping people who does not follow this law.

The main reason why this show not be condoned is, because most of these situations a citizen could get in a car accident. Approximately 1.6 million citizens die due to being on their cell phone while operating a vehicle. Nearly 390,000 people get real serious injuries due to texting and driving. One out of four of every car accident in the United States are due to texting and driving. In my opinion I believe texting and driving is the main reason we have so many deaths every year.

In conclusion, texting and driving needs to be/ stay illegal. That way people will not do it so often, which could decrease the death rate each year. Texting and driving could possibly be the reason why our death rates increase over time. Especially in this day and age, because almost everything now is technology based. In addition, I believe that texting and driving is not safe for yourself or others, so technology should be the last thing you are on while behind and active vehicle. Texts, calls, emails all can wait until you are in a secure place (not behind the wheel) to respond, and also that way nobody could die or have an injury
