Dear principal

Have you ever had a goal that was bigger than life well me and my friends have some to we want to play sports but these demands on B or better in all subjects is making that hard .we think that you shouldn't change the policy on B or better to B ,that would really make the players work over time and most would not have the time to play and to turn in B plus work.

by doing so the players would have a bad time and they wouldn't have the fun that these sports bring them.

With this new policy comes a lot of problems like some of the star players are C students and i don't think that they could Get a B in every class. most of the students not playing sports are below the C average and they have extra time to do it in twenty thirty maybe even hours more than most sports players in the school .Also the people who do have all B' s aren't playing sports because to caught up in work to get those b' s.

Most students will have to leave sports all together because they cant make the grades ,Maybe making the teams lose the best players in the school. Most of these kids are natural players taking this away will make them turn to other alternatives such as playin
