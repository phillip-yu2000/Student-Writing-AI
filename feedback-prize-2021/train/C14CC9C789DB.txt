The face on Mars could have not been by alien's because there was no alien monument at all. It is a rare thing to see something like that on a planet that has a lot of rumors of aliens. Yet you can still say or predict this wasn't an alien act.

After we saw the face on Mars we had to get more pictures of it. That might not change your mind, and you still might think it was an act of alien's ,but check this out. In paragraph 3 it says that it was a huge rock formation. It resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. This could possibly mean that it's the angle you are looking at it. If you were looking at the "head" from a diffrent angle it would probably not even look like a head anymore. This is a reason why it could not have been from aliens.

In paragraph 2 it says that when the face appeared on their monitors they were surprised. Even though the sensation was short lived, scientist figured it was just another martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. You may be asking, "Why dont you target Cydonia?'. The answer is it's hard work. In fact its very difficult work. The reason we don't target Cydonia is because, "We don't pass over the face very often," says Garvin in paragraph 9.

On April 8, 2001 a nice day in Cydonia We finally got a second look at it. "We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view," said Garvin. They captured another photo finally with one of their best camera's.

Now you are probably asking yourself what does this have to do with aliens. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Meaning that it wasn't an alien act. It was a huge rock formation.
