Do you like not being in control? Have you ever felt powerless? These are the feelings you would have if you own a driverless car. Sure, the car will make things easier at times, but what if it acts up. What could you do?

Driverless cars could be a great danger to society! I know that driverless cars can catch the eyes of our society, since we've become technology filled. We can't let that get to us though. Like everything else that requires a computer, there is always a flaw. We can't put our lives in the hands of these cars. In the article it mentions that these cars will not always know how to deal with traffic, accidents, driveways and construction. We could get in a accident or even get murdered from these cars.

Although there are many flaws with this model, there are also some postitves too. Instead of driving and struggling with your phone, you can easily put the car in control. You can call, talk to passangers, do work and even eat while it drives. I know it's hard for most drivers to put there complete attention on the road but it's not for a computer. There would be less accidents, no drunk driving and no sleeping at the wheel. It may be a good contribution to our society.

Even though driverless cars bring great contributions, what happens when it acts up? Sure you can take control of the car but what if you're not paying attention? You could create a serious accident. The article says that these cars can not respond to accidents. If you create a sudden accident would'nt that create the other driverless cars to spin out of control? I think we need to stick with our original cars. These driverless cars are ticking time bombs waiting to go off. Lets keep this place safe!
