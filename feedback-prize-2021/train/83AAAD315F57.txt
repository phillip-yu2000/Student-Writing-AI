I think students should be aloud to use there cell phone because what if its an important call like your grandpa died or something. I get the no texting thing but what if its important, we need a date or what time. we should be aloud to use them out side of the call in between classes call parents friends. Not in the class but out side of class that would be cool.

We don't need them in class because they can put our mind on something different other than school. No phones in class just out side of class at lunch or break. The phones are bad for inside of class because we need to learn not pay use phones in class. If we need to work on a test we cant use phones we will never learn anything, and get a poor grade on the test because we used a phone when you should have been listening to the teacher.
