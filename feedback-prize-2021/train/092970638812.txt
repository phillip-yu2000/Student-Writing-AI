Dear Principal of our School,

Ma'am if you change the policy to participate in sports to a B the student won't have anything to do at all to get their grades up. Some students use the sports in their life to get the good grades they need. Those are the people that need to participate in sports. Some of our student need help and if you want all of your athletes with a C to fail then go ahead because if you take away sports they might stop trying.

Here is a suggestion " All students must have a grade average of a C and if you make the team you have to try to get it up to all B' s." It will help so they can try hard to get their grades up and that will make them get a better average.

Thank You,

The Student and Athletes of the School
