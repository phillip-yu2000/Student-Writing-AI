No I think it wouldnt be good idea to teach students from home. I think it would be a bad idea because students could easily get distracted at home. Students could just not answer the video calls. Students could just simply also not keep up with the work due to improper communication.

Students could easily be distracted in video conferences with other things. Things that could help them not attend to the conference that is going on. As for classes that are taking place online, Students could just not be doing the work and be on other pages.

It can be easy to not attend any of these classes, you could just not show up, do the work , or simply just sleep in. If you dont attend these classes it could lead to serious consequences. These consequences could lead to serious things. It would be better to have a physical class to walk into and attend.

Some students are better learners when you directly speak to someone one on one. Not all Students learn the same, some learn by being up and active such as athletes, mechanics, and others. Students that choose to learn online could also not understand a subject and could end up needing a little more help. Like me, I

need a little more help sometimes from teachers so I need a physical class and physical person to help me.

So in conclusion, I think it would not be a good idea to have students taught at home because of the distractions, Attendance, and miss communication. Therefore it would be better for a student to learn in a classroom with a Teacher that could help the student if he ever needs the help.
