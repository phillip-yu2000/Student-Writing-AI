In this passage the author supports his/ her idea by explaining that there are so many risks that will be taken if you land on Venus unprepared. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying, "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent cardon dioxide blankets Venus", which means that Venus is covered in a dangerous acid that basically covers the whole entire planet.

In the text i chose this quote because it explains one of the many dangers to going to the planet Venus ans why it is very dangerous and risky because lives could be on the line.

In summary you should not go to Venus because the author has made a great point about how dangerous it is and he is trying to persaude you not to go but not only that but he is also trying to expalin to you in detail the pro's and con's of going to Venus.
