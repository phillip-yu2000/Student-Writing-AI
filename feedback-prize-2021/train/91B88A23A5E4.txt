Dear principal,

you are considering of changing school policy so that we the students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have at least a grade B average. while many of us have a grade C, i know you are trying to make us bring our grades up by doing this but understand that we like doing sports and activities especially our favorites but you can't do that because it sounds like threat to us. you can do something else but not stopping us from sports and activities without making at least a B, please cancel this policy because we really need sports and activities to keep our body focus and healthy and we also promise to keep the good grades and do our homework's, and try our best to keep up the A' s and B 's.

P. s please don't forget we love sports and activities because we the students really have fun with it.

Thank you.

From Your

Students
