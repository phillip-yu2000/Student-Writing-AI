Receiving advice from multiple people is a good thing. Doing this gives you multiple options. Having lots of options means that there is more than one way to solve a problem. When i'm in trouble I ask more than one person to see if I have any better options. Ways to help are asking more than one person to help you with something,come up with your own ideas,and try to avoid the problem.

Asking other people for help can have different outcomes. Most likely they will all have different answers . lets say your having problems with you sister, they mite say get revenge or try being even nicer. Some peoples answers will be the same. When you have problems ask multiple people for help and choose the best option.

The next best thing is to try to solve it yourself. When things get too out of hand thats when you ask for help. Problem solving helps you when the same problem comes again. I prefer to do things on my own anyway that means there will be now one to get in my way. It's easier that way.

Trying to avoid the problem is good but not grate because it will always come back to get you. I tried to avoid a problem but it kept hunting me . you cant get away from your problems they have to be solved in order to go away. Having something on your sholders is harder. Go get help if you need it.

Help others around you and get help from others . Its was better to have help than trying to avoid the problem. If you like doing things alone than try to solve it on your own. If things are to mush to handle get help. Listen to people advice they mite the right answer.
