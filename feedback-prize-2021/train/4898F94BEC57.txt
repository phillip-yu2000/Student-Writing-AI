Luke Bombeger had no idea that his life would soon change after graduaduation. People should participate in the seagoing cowboys program because they need people to watch over the animals. Thank gosh luke and don signed up because if they didnt they probably not have anybody to watch the animals. they had to take care of horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped over sea.

They arived Augest 14. The day the pacific war ended ''luke said''.Luke had made 9 trips. Thats the most of any seagoing cowboy.

The cattle-boat were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small town boy. He had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete .And marveled at the panama canal on his way to china.

It took them about two weeks to cvross the Alantic Ocean. It took them about a month to get from the eastern cost of the U.S. to China. Caring for all of thoes animals kept them really busey. They had to be fed,and watered 3 times a day and there were lots of animals there too so it was harder than it seems.

Others need to particapate in this because it would help take care of the animals. It would also help Luke and Don out so they wouoldnt have to do that much work by them selves.
