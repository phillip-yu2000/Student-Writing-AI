The Face on Mars is just a landform. NASA scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa which was common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. Cydonia is the region of Mars where the Face was located.

Scientist said that the Face was just huge rock formations that resembled a human head. The defenders of the NASA budget wished that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. NASA decided to look again because they felt it was important to tax payers. On April 5,1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. They snapped a picture that revealed what was only a ntural landform. Some people still didn't believe and said it could be clouds blocking out evidence. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day Mars Global Surveyor flew close enough for another look. They captured a high-quality photo with maximum solution.

If there were objects in the 2001 picture you could see what they were. What the picture shows is the Martian form of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. They were common around the American West.
