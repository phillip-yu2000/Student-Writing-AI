If people participated on joining the Seagoing Cowboys then it would be better because then they can help people that are stuck in world war 2. If more people joined then it would help becaus then people would have different kind of things to do. So people should participate on joining the Seagoing Cowboys.

People should participate on joining because if there is more people then it's better because then it wouldn't take lots of time to do everything. People could get in groups and split to help people that are hurt or that are worried to get killed because of world war 2. If people participated then they could help out and help out on the ship because the horses had to be fed 2 or 3 times a day. Each person will have something to do if they particpated. if people joined then when they were all done then they could've got something because they helped out people that were in danger. When they have done what they had to do then they would get time to play when they went back to their base or to the United States.

So if people helped then it would've been more easier to do things. They would have gave lots of people food and supplies because they were in Europe whe the world war 3 started. So then different armies joined and they helped out but it would be better if more people joined to help. If people joined then it meant that they care about people when they are in danger.
