Dear Florida Senator,

We should not use the Electoral College, because it causes confusion and mostly anger. Sometimes when the Electoral College elects one canidate, even though he got less popular votes, he can screw up the whole system.

Some people do not understand how the Electoral College works, and they become confused as to how the canidate with the least amount of popular votes could become president.

Most people get angry and then the crime count rises, because some people absolutely do not want a certain canidate to become presdient, because of the things they were told, and that they researched about the canidate. When the canidate they voted for doesn't win the election even though they had the most popular votes, they go on a rampage, and do things that they wouldn't normally do, out of anger, because some people are extremely political, and they cannot help but to start problems in their community.

For example, many people think that Barrack Obama in screwing up the American unity and way of life. Like trying to ban guns, which are legally gufted to us under the 2nd Amendmant of the Constitution.

On the the hand, sometimes the canidate with the most popular votes can be the worst if he became president. I believe that the American people should be given all the facts sp that we can at least help the Electoral College make the decision of who shall become president.

Sincerly,

PROPER_NAME
