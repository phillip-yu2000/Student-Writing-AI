To Principal,

With most kids having a C average it would be unfair for the students that love to play sports. Even with a B average it would become difficult to have a success at college, but with a C average, and good at sports the chances for a scholarship increase greatly. Sports also greatly helps kids with everyday lives. It teaches them teamwork which helps in projects for school and helps kids get along.

Other activities like debate, ROTC, and fine arts greatly help a students learning by teaching outside of school. Without clubs, school to students would become more boring and they would feel like they have to go to school instead of wanting to come to school. With that in mind, if school becomes too boring the students might stop trying and instead of C averages you'll have D and F averages. With a C average you will have a better school with happier students and will greatly affect the success of the school, the teachers, and the principal.
