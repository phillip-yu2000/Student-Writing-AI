Do you think a world with driverless cars would be safe? Well, if you ask me, my answer is no. Let's look at my reasoning as to why.

In the article we read, the author says that some car manufacturers are "bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays". I, for one, don't think "heads up displays" are a great idea. I mean, we may as well put mini televisions in the steering wheels while we're at it! In addition, GM's new vibrating seem less than lovely. Do you want your designated driver's seat massaging them to sleep? I most certainly do not. It just does not seem safe! Are we gonna start showering with the help of robots? I think taking away the privilege of driving is not good. It makes it seem like such a chore. What will teenagers look forward to? Where is the responsibility? Imagine how you felt when you finally turned and sixteen and got to get your hands on a wheel. It must be a feeling like no other! While it is a cool thought, we must really think these thing through, people! Think of the people who have jobs in public transportation. What will they do to support their families when they lose their job to a robot? Driverless can potentially ruin the lives of many.

All in all, I think the negatives outweigh the positives in this situation. Say NO to driverless cars! In a world where everything operates itself, it's nice to have a little responsibility.
