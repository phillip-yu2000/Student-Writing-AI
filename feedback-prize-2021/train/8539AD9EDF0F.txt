I believe you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. This can be a great opportunity for you. You can visit places and experience new adventures you haven't experienced before.

If you like helping others this program is great for you. You are going to be helping. take care of the animials that are going to be shipped overseas. You also have a chance of seeing some of the views of other countries you might not have seen before.

You will be busy taking care of the animals. You would have to water and feed the animals two or three time a day. Also the "bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship." The stalls also have to be cleaned.

Once the animals are unloaded, you can have more fun. Hang out with friend you made during the program. You'll have a lot of time on board since are going to be unloaded. The trip is long. The program could be like a break, to relax a bit. Playing games in the empty holds on the way back home, can help time pass by.

This program is a opportunity, you could learn some thing during this program. You are helping countries that were left in ruins. This program is about helping the countries that were destructed during World War II.

Signing up with a friend of mine is opportunity we had. I'm grateful we got to experience this opportunity. I am now more aware of the people needs that other countries have. This program is a opportunity and you should consider participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
