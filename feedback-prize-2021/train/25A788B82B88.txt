Dear state senator, I think the electoral collage is unfair and should be abolished because it is unfair to voters.

Its unfair to voters because of the winner take all system candidates dont spend time in state they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the states. And also because of the electoral vote, because each state only casts 1 vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 million voters. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, the house's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. The electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, a non democratic method of picking a president that will to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. Although there is some ups to the electoral college like certainty of outcome and swing states, electoral college is not fair to the people because they dont get as much say as representatives and popular votes so they should abolish the electoral college to give the people a little more say.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
