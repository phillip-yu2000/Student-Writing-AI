The use of the techonology is not valuable in a classroom because students may not want anyone to know how they feel. Students should be able to keep their emotions to themselves if they do not wish to share them. Students shouldnt have to walk in class and automatically tell a teacher or a peer how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions are something a student might not want to share because they might be going throught something personal thry dont want anyone to know about. In paragraph three Dr. Huang says, "A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored." then later on in the paragraph he says, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotion and communication..." So if humans don't communicate their feelings to eachother then they probably don't want a computer to communicate them. Some people may say that that would be a good thing for students because it might help them open up more, but it would just force them to say how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions should be privite unless the person wants to share them. Students shouldn't be forced to share their emotions because a computer is there caculating them for everyone to see.
