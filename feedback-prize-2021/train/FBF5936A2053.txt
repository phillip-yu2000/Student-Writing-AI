The Face of Mars is a natural landform and I'll tell you why. For many years we have been taking pictures and observing it to look at what it really was. We just got a new sattelite and we took the pictures. It's not what most of the media thinks.

The new pictures taken from the spacecraft show that it is clearly a mesa formed rather than an ancient artifact created by extra-terrestrial life. It was formed just like the landform would on earth and the pictures clearly show it's not even a face anymore. Everything adds up to mesa and the thought of ancient artifacts are pointless. There is no life evidence on Mars. You guys are called conspiracy theorists for a reason. The word theory is a guess. This isn't a guess. At NASA we figured out it is a mesa landform and have proof.

That is why you are wrong and no other theory could counter our results. Science facts against a civilian's thoughts, facts win. Science prooves yet another thing on another planet. HD pictures are hard proof that it is a natural landform.
