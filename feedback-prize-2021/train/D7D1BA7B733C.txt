dear principal

I believe that it would be good for kids to half to do work. but many kids have activities after school so they may not be able to do this. it should be a choice but not a thing they should have to do. there for i think that kids should not have to do community service because many kids now a days have chores to do at home not ones to do at school to we go to school to learn about skills needed in the real world not to do work for the community sake. i believe that we are at school to learn not to work. this is not just a easy thing to decide on a lot more people should decide on this besides just the principle, this should be up to us the students. not just us are parents as well, and there should be a reward if students do this work. like a treat like ice cream, or a pizza party. Thank you for your time.
