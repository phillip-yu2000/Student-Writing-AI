Studying Venus is dangerous and hazardous. The author explains what exactly makes it this way and even so the author explains why we should still study it. The author explains how venus is most like earth in terms of density and size. Astronomers beleive that Venus "may well once have been the moat earth-like planet in our solar system."

The author talks about how Venus gets "over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphereic pressure is 90 times greater" than earth. The author talks about hiw metal would melt on teh surface and how the pressure would smash a specially made submarine. Venus also contains "eruptig volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightening strikes." Even thirty-plus miles above the surface, tempatures would stll be around 170 degrees fahrenhiet, but pressure would be around what it is like at sea level on earth. With all of this bad you would have plentiful solar power and radiation would exceed earth levels. The author explains how we can't speciments from venus abd that we need to find a way to get the speciments. Researchers are working on innovation that would allow machines long time to last whule contrubuting to our knowledge of our sister planet.

Venus is dangerous but NASA and many other researchers are looking for ways to make studying venus possible. Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades, and researchers are trying to change that. Researchers are looking bck at technology used in world war two. The author takls about venus being a backu planet if this planet becomes unlivable.
