Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughtout the years, different countries have incouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their "goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog." Other places, like Paris, banned driving to "clear the air of the global city." This is due to "days of near-record pollution." The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, "When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way." Also, businessman, Carlos A. Plaza, said, "It's a good opportunity to take away stress." as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. When you don't drive, you don't have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams, you won't be mad because someone just cut you off, or that the teenage girl in front of you isn't paying attention because she is talking on the phone and doing her mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street, you will realize how stressful driving can be.

In conclusion, driving only causes air pollution and more stressfull days. Walking, riding a bike, or riding the bus not only saves money, but it also helps the environment and makes you a happy person.
