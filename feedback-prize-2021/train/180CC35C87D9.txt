Dear Principal,

I am writing to you about the cell phone policies you are considering. I think that most of the students here would like to see you allow us the have our phones out during lunch and other free times as long as there turned off during class time. I think i speak for everyone when i say this. I also think if this went into effect soon it would make kids realize that you shouldn't text during class that they should wait until lunch or after school.

Not allowing students to use their phone will make them use it during class instead of waiting till lunch because they know that they don't have the time to use them anyway. However, if students know they have time to use their phones during school at certain times it may make kids stop during class times. I also think that if kids use their phones a lot during school and the kid they are talking to gets their phone taken away it could make that kid stop texting along with others since they could use it more often.

In conclusion I think that you should really consider choosing policy number one. This would make a lot of students excited to know that they have some time to use their phones during school. This could be a good thing for the school and the kids that go here.

Sincerely,

Student
