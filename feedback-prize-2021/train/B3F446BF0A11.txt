I am now going to tell you what i think about technology reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom here ar the three things I'll be talking about, first what i think about this idea, secondly do i like this idea and thirdly if this will be valuable for teachers in the future. First i personally think that this idea is great because people can know what facal expression a persons has just by a simple computer and i think that's very cool "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Hung predicts. "Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor". Secondly i really like this idea because a computer can structure a 3-D model of your face and move your cheek bones to make you smile, squint your eyes, and show teeth also when your angry move your eyebrows, close your lips things like that "Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscle. For example above your eyes, raise your eyebrows when you're surprised, around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger". Finally this can be very valuable for teachers in the future because teachers can use that computer that reads emotional expressions on his/ her students to see their facial expression and tell what they are feeling this could help the teacher by making her class less boring, doing more avtivities, explaining more the lesson so students can understand and be less confused "you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect". This shows that technology is coming more advanced each year and it will be improving also technology can help in alot of things that could be very benificial for some people and other things like construction, health, school and information.
