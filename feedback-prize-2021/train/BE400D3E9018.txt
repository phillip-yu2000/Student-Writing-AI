Driverless cars would not be a good idea for our society to convert to. A car without a driver would be more dangerous. It would also not be as mentally stimulating as actually driving is. It would lead to laziness. There would also be more accidents.

Driverless cars would be detrimental to our society. Cars without dirvers would not be safe and would lead to more accidents. Without an actual thinking human behind the wheel, anything could go worong. There could be a system malfunction that could result in the deaths of many people. Driverless cars would also not be as mentally healthy as driving a real car is. Driverless cars would not be mentally stimulating at all. Sure, the car may be able to provide entertainment for the driver, but that is nothing compared to the mental benefit of driving. Driving requires you to think about your actions, whereas simply being entertained does not. Not driving your own car would also lead to more laziness. If humans stop having the energy to just drive their own car, then what comes next? We stop walking and breathing on our own too? Driverless cars would just push us closer to doing nothing for ourselves and relying on technology completely.

Driverless cars are something that our society needs to avoid. They would cause many more injuries and accidents than our current cars do. They would not be mentally healthy. They would urge our society to become even more dependent on technology than we already are. Overall, driverless cars would just be detrimental.
