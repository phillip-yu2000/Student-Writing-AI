The conviniance of the cars would be nice, but what if the car malfunctioned and it crashed? Would the car owner be responcible or would the manufacturer? Whould the cars be able to be hacked, like a cell phone or laptop?

How would the person or people in the car know they are safe?

I would not feel comfertoble having a computer driving me around and deciding if it takes me through a bad naughborhood or if it takes the long way around. ""The psycological aspects of automation are really a chalenge," admits Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver." If I were to be put in danger, would that compurter be able to get me out of that danger? I don't think so because, again, it is a programed computer. The car is programed to follow the laws set forth. If going over the speed limit to get away from a person trying to harm me or the people I am with is the way that we stay alive, then that's what needs to be done.

If the car is programed to go the speed limit, how many police officers would lose their job? There would be no speeding, so there would be no need to have them on the road as much.

What would happen if there was a fire? If the vehicls are programed to go the speed limit, how will the fire fighters get to the house on time? If there is an acident, because the person in the car has no control over it, how will the peramedics get to the scene on time?

If the car doors are locked and there is no way to get out in a crash, there will be more of a chance of people dieing from a car crash than before the cars come out. The officers would have to cut the person out, if that can be done. If the crash is so bad that the person can't be cut out what does that say about cars manufacturer?

In comclution, I think that having driverless cars could cause more damage than good. Yes, it would be more convinient, but safe I dont think so.
