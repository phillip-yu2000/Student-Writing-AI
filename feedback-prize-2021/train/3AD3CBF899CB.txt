As a NASA scientist I know more about how the Face is not made from aliens. First off how would aliens create the face because they probably never seen a human. We never seen any evidence that supports that aliens are real. So how would aliens create the face if we don't have any evidence that they are real?

The face is made from rocks. Rocks like from Mars. The face is just a natural landform nothing else. Since the Face is made from Rocks and is on Mars it is called a mesa. Its basically a huge rock formation eveyone would say, even I would say it. There might have been an ancient civillization there, but we are still finding out new stuff everyday.

Yes the face has been a pop icon. It has appeared in many books, magazines even radio talk shows. Some people even think that it is possible that there is somehow life there on Mars.

You shouldn't believe that aliens really did make the face. We don't have any proof that aliens are even real. So we can't say that aliens made the face. Since there are humans are Earth then there could probably once have been humans on Mars, but we have no clue at all. So far its just a natural landform since we have no proof its made from humans or even possible aliens.
