The idea of not having the resposibility of driving has been wanted by many for years. It has been seen as a futuristic thing that could almost never happen. Now, the driverless car has been invented. Many will be pleased with this, but many will not. I, for one, am against driverless cars for several reasons. Some of those reasons are liability and cost.

One concern of driverless cars is liability. If a driverless car gets into a wreck, who should be held responsible? Some would say the car manufature and other would say the person in the vehicle. There are so many different type of situations that every situation would be different. I think that the car manufacture should be held responsible for the driverless car since they made the car, unless the person inside the vehicle had to take control. There will be controversy over every car accident.

Another concern is the cost that these cars will bring to every city. As said in the readin "Driverless Cars Are Coming", roads might have to be redone. This will cost thousands for many cities and states. If another city gets new roads before another then a driverless car could not go into that city. That may be the place the passanger is wanting to go also. Producing these cars would cost more also. More satellites would have to be made to accomidate all of the driverless cars, too. If there are too many driverless cars out and the system fails, that will cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.

Futuristic ideas have always been sought for, one of them being driverless cars. There are many different position on them, but mine is that they should not be made. There are many concerns about driverless cars, a couple of them being liability and cost. Although this thing is highly wanted, will it be the right thing to do for our society?
