I believe that policy number one would be the plan to go with. Yes, we are always on our phones, but why not be able to text while teachers aren't teaching and we're not missing out on any assignments,

lessons or getting sidetracked from what is being taught? If the principle decided to go with this policy maybe it would even decrease how much students text and use their phones during class. If so, it would be either because we've already gotten done what we need to do on our phones before class, or we wait because we know we won't get in trouble at lunch for using our cell phones.

In many of my classes my friends text. As I stated before, if this policy were to be enforced I believe kids would text less. If the staff of the school were to keep better tabs and pay more attention to kids using their phones we would be scared out of it and just text during lunch and between classes. If the staff was to be more careful about kids using their phones but NOT let them text during free time, I believe kids would try harder to text and would do anything related to their phones more often just to be mischievous.

Although policy #1 has it's exceptions, limits, and cons, it might even help bring grades up with struggling kids. If they knew they were able to text during free times then they would forget about it for the time being and wait until the designated period of when they could. Even in the better behaved, less troublesome kids I think there is a possibility of their grades raising, And maybe even attitude changes to go along with that.

As I said earlier, there are exceptions, limits and cons. Examples are when kids are sexting, cyber bullying, or inappropriately using their phones.

But all in all, I think this policy would be better than either accepting phones or shutting them out completely. The principle should go with their first instinct and let phones be allowed at some times to increase the school's over all well being.
