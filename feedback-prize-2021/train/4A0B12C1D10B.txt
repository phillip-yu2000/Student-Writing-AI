I am against the principal changing the school policy on the students at the school having to keep a b average to be on sports teams and other after school activities. Most of the students at school have a c average. So, they should not have to keep a b average before they play any after school activities or sports. Some of the students have something that helps them after school on their grades such as tutoring for math or even reading. so I don't think she should change school policy because she would have students failing in their classes. These students will probably not be able to keep a b average in their classes. So most of the students will probably fail that school year.

These changes will hurt some of the students grades the next school year. The principal might wont to look at what these after school activities has done for the school. I hope she will rethink this whole thing about wanting to change the school policy.

The reason i think this was a bad idea was because the students need certain after school activities such as tutoring. Sports my help some of the teams with team work.
