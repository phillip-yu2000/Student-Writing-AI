Dear,

TEACHER_NAME

I think what your doing is wrong. First, students here at this school are barely learning anything. maybe a handful of students in each grade has a B average. There's no way this plan will work. Maybe sports and other activities should be taken away if your going to make students have a B average to participate in sports and activities. But then again, it may push students to work hard and it may bring students grades up cause they want to participate in things. The best thing to do is to have the students take a vote. If that happens I'm pretty sure this wouldn't work out in your favor. Many students wouldn't care about this policy because, they don't like school or any activities at the school, there coming to school to learn not to play. What your trying to do should be looked over my the board of education. It's not right to do this at this school. Kids are trying hard to learn but nothing is happening. Maybe you should work on getting students grades up before you try to raise a letter grade just for them to participate in school activities.

Sincerely,
