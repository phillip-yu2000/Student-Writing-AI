I think other peolpe should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. The main resion i think that is because i went though it and i lerned a lot from it. It gave me a lot of good life examples that i can look back on which is always good. Thats one of the resoins i think more people should go though it.

I think other people should do it because you get to see a lot of places. Like besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special. Thats only one of the many benefits of being in the program.

Another reson i think more people should join is that you get to be with all the cute animals. I know it sounds like hard work but it pays off . Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Thats all just part of the job though which is good.

One other benifit of the job was when your not checking on the animals you have some free time. The cowboys played baceball and volleyball gmaes in the empty hold where the animals had beed housed. Table tennis tounaments, fencing,boxing,reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time. See yes you have to work but you also get some time to have fun.

Thats why i think more people should be a Seagoing Cowboy but being that is much more than an adventure. For me it opened up the world im grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Thats why i want people to do what i did because that awareness stays with them i know it stayed with me.
