What the rule does

This new policy that you have made is just wrong.

With this new rule applied I can see to many students getting cut from sports.

In your decision you have affected way to many students.

I know people that get a c in at least one or maybe two classes, but making this rule is unacceptable to me because people aren't that smart in every subject.

I would see a lot of rage going through this school and a lot of smack talk about you, and it's all just because you made it so they needed a b average grade in this school.

With this problem you can affect a lot of kids.

You could for instants kick half the players off the football team, then we wouldn't have enough players.

Kicking kids off of school teams could put them in a position where they have nothing to do now.

and results of that could kill a kids self a steam.

A child with nothing to do could cause him to sit on his couch for instants and oh watch T.V.

This could cause them to gain wait and as you say it become fat and then get made fun of.

Making a new policy could even upset the parents.

If this is put into affect in the middle of the year and the kids are kicked off the team or removed, this causes the parents to lose money unless you are willing to give a refund.

Applying this could cause anger and then some students could and will take it out on others for no reason.

I am even affected by this new rule or policy i am not strong in science and i never really have been.

Back to the self a steam part.

Lowering a kids confidence or self a steam is one thing that you should do.

this could make them feel stupid for the fact that they can't even play sports because of this going into affect.

Now this is just me but I'm pretty sure that plenty of others feel the same way about this act. i hope you reconsider what you're doing.
