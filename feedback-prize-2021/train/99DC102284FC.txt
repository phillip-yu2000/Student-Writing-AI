The use of technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable. Having computers be able to detect the emtions you are feeling will be a good thing.

Technology will start to help students do better in school and help to learn understand how they might be feeling while doing school work. Paragraph 6 states " a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This quote shows that in the future technology could help students become more engaged in their school work and help them be able to focus. Teachers teach in certain ways and it usually doesn't work for all the students in the class, while having better technology will help the student possibly become better at the subject. "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang, so computers need to understand that, too." Communication in humans is mostly read through body language and facial expressions and techonology right now can not detect those things. Once computers can read facial expressions many classrooms will have students who are more excited about doing their school work because it'll be based on what they prefer and how they learn best.

In the future technology will be able to do much more then it already can now. The use of technology to help read peoples' emotions in a classroom will become valuable.
