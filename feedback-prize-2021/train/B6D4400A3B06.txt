My mother always said "Generic_Name, life is much simpler when you trust and take advice from others." Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices, for they can use those opinions to make an objective one, they can learn lessons from others, and it can cause someone to become a better person.

First an objective opinion can help by, being unbiased therefor one can make harder decisions that can effect their life in serious ways. it can also keep one from siding with a bad influence or group out of bias or personal opinion, therefor keeping out of trouble or harmful situations.

Next using these opinions can teach someone useful lessons in life, like who to hang out with, and how much trouble one can avoid, or even if they should buy that new phone without looking at the reviews. Those reviews are very important for someone if they are going to buy something. If they pay attention to them, they can find out if the purchase is worth it or not. That is why its beneficial to take lessons from others' opinions.

Then there is the fact that listening to other peoples' opinions can create a better person, it can give them something to fall back on when they cannot use their own wits to escape a situation. Because of this people will want to trust them, and want to help them when in need. These in turn will raiseÂ their sense of self tremendously, and create an all around better citizen.

Finally using these opinions someone can, create an objective opinion, they can learn valuable lessons from others, and become the best person they possibly can be. When my mother told me that i should listen and take advice from others', think this is what she wanted for me.
