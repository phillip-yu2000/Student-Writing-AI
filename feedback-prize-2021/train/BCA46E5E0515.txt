Driverless cars could be beneficial in many ways including elderly people disabled people or people that don't know how to drive well. Driverless cars are very controvesial by many just because we have told for so long that the only way a car is safe is for it to be driven by an alert human being. With technology advancing at rates that it is why are driverless cars so bad to some people when a computer is capable of knowing everything and people seem to be getting less and less smart every day why are driverless cars not an option.

Cars have not really changed in a very long time yeah they gotten safer and more powerful but they are pretty much the same concept. So with driverless cars not only will they be able to let that person thats been in a wheel chair feel like they are behind the wheel of a car but it will be a whole new concept that can be improved on for a very long time just like the modern cars of today.

Driverless car will soon be the only thing on roads and thats going to be a big change for a lot of people but it will benefit everybody in major ways. Like there will be a lot less wrecks because of people falling asleep or texting. Also it will be one of those things that people have fascinised about ever since the first car was invented.
