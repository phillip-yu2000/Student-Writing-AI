Policy 2

I don't think they should have the phones at school at all because that is a detraction to other people in the class and to the teacher. If a teacher is trying to teach you something and you on your phone are your phone goes off the teacher is going to have to stop what she is doing and take 10 min to find out who's phone is it mostlikey they are not going to say it was my phone and i think it also is a detraction to themselves because they are going to be on the phone texting or talking on the phone instead of getting there work done like they should be doing and your also detracting the person you are also talking to because you are talking to them and they are in school trying to get there work done and they cant because they are to busies on the phone talking to you about nothing that has to do with work or nothing school related. I will say that is they have a game of some type they can bring there phones but leave them in the office i can say yes to that because i understand that you are away and you want to let your parents know that your on your way to the game are school so they know when to come and pick you up i can understand that matter but for just bring your phone to school do not approve of that because like i said its a big detraction to others you might not think it is but it is. And for home work you should not have your phone on because you are going to get sidetracked you are going to be on the phone and doing your homework as well.
