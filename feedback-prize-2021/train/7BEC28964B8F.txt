Dear principal,

I think students around the world should not use their cell phones at school because it's a distraction to yourself and others around you. Having cell phones at school could also be a method for someone to communicate with someone else in school and could be, for example, a possible bomb threat. Another reason why students shouldn't have cell phones at school is because they could interrupt a class and therefore could lower their grades.

In case of an emergency, someone could use their cell phones to call the police for help. You could also call you're parents to tell them that your okay. Another good reason to have your cell phone at school is because you could call home to tell your parents to bring you what you might of forgotten at home.

There are many reasons to not have cell phones at school, but the most important of them all is cheating. Someone could use their cell to use as a calculator to cheat for their quiz or test. The worst of them all is black mailing someone and if you do it and get caught by someone, you could me in serious trouble. the reason black mailing is bad is because you could use a phone to mess with someone or take advantage of them and tell them that your going to do something if they don't do this. This is why i think cell phone should not be allowed in school, there are just to many risks and threats to schools.
