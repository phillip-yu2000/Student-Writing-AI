To start off with, electing electors sounds a little bit redundant. Also, why do we vote for somebody that can vote in their own right as mentioned in article two provided to me? I say as a citizen of the United States that we should vote directly to determine the new president.

If we vote for a representative of our state to elect our president, how can we be certain that he/she will vote as planned? The entire system is far from perfection, but can be fixed temporally. By changing the amount of votes to numbers that be added to equal the amount of representatives respectivly, it can provide an estamation of how many representatives from a state can elect a certain party. For example, if 4,000,000 people vote for republican and 16,000,000 vote democrat in a state with 10 representatives, 2 representatives will vote republican, 8 will vote democrat.

However, if you do this, there will still be flaws in the system. The best way in my opinion of electing a presedent is to go ahead and let the people vote their opinion. Simple calculations to find percentages can determine the majority vote and elect the president/vice president, making things alot cheaper and more efficient. All by using a simple four-function calculator.

To wrap things up, I will state that even though I am only part of the minority of the U.S., I am still a citizen stating his/her opinion towards a better future towards my homeland. Let's put the power back into the people, that way everybody's opinion, no matter rank, wealth, age, can/will count towards our next election in 2016.
