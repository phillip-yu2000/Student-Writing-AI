The "Face on Mars" may seem like is was created by aliens but it is just a coincidence that the landform looks just like a face. The "Face on Mars" is in fact just a mesa but with "unusual shadows that made it look like an Egytian Pharaoh". In my opinion,it may seem like a alien has created the face on Mars but I belive that such a thing as alien do not exist.

The picture of the face being in 1976 did not have good quality with the high technology we have today. So when Michael Malin and his MOS team took a photo of the face recently people were shocked to find out that the face is just a natural landform. Also, not many scientist belive that the face is a alien artifact either. The face on Mars is just a "huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."

The "Face on Mars" may seem like it was created by aliens but it was just a coincidence that the natural landform resembled a human face. The shadows around the face make the landform seem like it has a mouth, nose, and eyes but it is just a mesa. In conclusion, the face that was captured on a region on Mars, Cydonia, is in fact a natural landform and was not formed by aliens.
