When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person because it will help them and make the question easier they could get different opinions and put them together to make one of there own.

If you ask more than one person for advice you will have plenty of options to pick from because, everyone has different ideas but most people will say something similar to one another.

As a student I would ask everyone for there opinions and take all of they're ideas and make them into one of my own.

If i were to ask someone for advice I would, ask another relative for advice just to see if they are on the same page. For example,if I needed help I would ask every person at my table for advice and then, out of those people some of them would have the same advice or on the same page as one another.

If your not sure about a question you should asked a pear for some explainations or ideas because every person's thought's count.
