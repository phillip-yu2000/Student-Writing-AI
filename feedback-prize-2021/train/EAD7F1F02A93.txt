Dear principal,

I do not think it would be a good idea for students to need a B average for sports.

If most students have a C average, then only A and B be students can play. It is reasonable to take away sports from students who have bad grades, but C students disserve to play too. I think it would be idea to lower the restrictions to a D grade average or lower. And that if a student makes up his or her F or D to a C average, then they should get to play. You may not agree but i assure students will work just as hard to get a C as they would for a B. Also students that want to go in activities will be restricted. I would be better for a lot of people if you had C students in activities too. So, please consider, I think it would be a good idea to take the sport and activities restriction down to only D and F averages.
