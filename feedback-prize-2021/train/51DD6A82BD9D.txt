American teens love there phones they love to text and call all of there friends but this i starting to be a problem at schools all over the United States. Teenagers all over the U.S text during class or during lunch. Phones are taken by teachers and taken to the office.

policy 1 Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times. policy 2 Do not allow students to have phones at school.

First, students should not be allowed to have phones at school because . Students are going to text during class . people might say , students wont use there phones during school because they are mature enough to follow directions but i say no some students might listen but others are not going to care and use the phone . Next phones going off in class is a distraction for all of the students and the teachers , but students might say that they will keep there phone on silent , but i say no students mig
