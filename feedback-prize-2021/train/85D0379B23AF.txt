People have their own opinions about the Electoral College; whether it should be taken away or kept. They have good reasons, but honestly do they really need the electors to vote for our people?

The Electoral College should be abolished. Why do people still defend the electoral college? The voters don't even vote for a president. They vote for a slate of electors. Why can't us voters control the electors. You're not really voting for the president, you're basically voting for electors who are pledged to the specific candidate. The electoral college isnt needed.

Let the voters vote for who they want. They know what that candidate is gonna do for their people when they become president. We don't need people who are pledged to that candidate to keep debating over them. It states that when you vote for a presidential candidate, you are actually voting for a slate of electors.

The Electoral College stays with us, only to keep the voting in balance. They should just do the winner-take-all. Everyone despises the electoral college. It has no purpose to be retained, but only to keep the voting balanced.
