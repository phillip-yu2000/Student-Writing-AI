The picture of faces on Mars are actually natural landforms, known as buttes or mesas. The text states that the picture really shows a Martian version of a butte or mesa. The text also states that you can find other mesas around the American West. Mesas are pieces of land that above ground-level. The author also stated that, Garvin, a mission controller, said that it reminded him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars. Although, I can see why people would think it was created by aliens, there are more facts to prove that its a natural landform. Scientists have shown that, as of right now, there are no signs of life on Mars, so aliens could not have made it. In conclusion, science has proved many more facts about the Face than a conspiracy theorist has.
