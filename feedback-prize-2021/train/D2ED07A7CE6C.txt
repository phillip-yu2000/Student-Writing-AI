Dear state senator,

I would like to inform you of my place, and arguments for changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

I am in favor of changing to the electon throught popular vote becuase if you really think about it, who is getting a president? it's the citizens. The citizens that are qualified to vote are voting on who they think is going to support us best based on our every day lives. so therefore it should be the citizens choice on who is THEIR president rather than the factor of both the votes in congress and votes of citizens. It should be the votes of the citizens that decide wether or not this person should be elected to run OUR country!

The Electorial College is completely unfair. it basically defeats the purpose of us even voting becuase electors have the power to go completely against what the people say, and a lot of the time they will just because they can. That's the way everything is, the government will do everything in its power to try and to the complete opposite of what the people want to happen.

What the people want to happen is not selfish, it's what they, the people, know what would all around help everybody. But once again, the government will do everything in it's power to do the opposite of what we want to happend and what we know id right for all the people not just a few, or one.

Thank you for your time,

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME       Â
