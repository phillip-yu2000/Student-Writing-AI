Don't you ever wonder why people ask several others for advice? It can be, to have several different ways to look at the situation, to have a different opening of the situation or to have a better understanding of the situation they are going through.

People may ask several people for advice so they can see several different ways to look at a situation. For example, I didn't know whether or not to move from New York to Virginia. So I asked my friends and they gave me plenty of pros and cons about whether I should move or not. So I took all of the advice into consideration and I moved. So asking several people for advice is a really good idea.

However, asking several people for advice can give someone a bigger opening to their situation. As an example, I thought only before about the cons of moving from New York to Virginia. Than I realized that here in Virginia their are way better academic and sports teams over here. This news from several of friends made me really happy. This is another great reason why people talk to several others for advice.

Lastly, talking to several people for advice can give people a better understanding of the situation they are going through. Normally even if i didn't want to move and my mom wanted to I would've followed hr either way. So my mom talked it out with me. Explained every little detail she should have and it gave me a clearer understanding o why we should move. I understood everything she told me and now i know why we should have moved over here. I was happy with the outcome and we knew we were ready to move.

In Conclusion, these are my reasons why many people talk to several others for advice. This is why I also believe talking to others about advice that you need is beneficial for yourself.
