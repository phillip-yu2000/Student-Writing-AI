In the world that we live in today, every individuals opinoin matters. When you are voting, you want to be sure that you have a stand for what our voting for. The only way to effectivly do this, is to get rid of the electoral collage. The electoral collage is not nessacary because they just over ride the peoples votes in thier own way when the president has hired them to represent him.

According to Bradford Plumer in paragraph 10,he states "Under the electoral collage system voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors, who in turn elect the president." In this here we see that the citizens dont have much of of a say, but even if some say that this is not true, It would be very minimal when it come to how much of a diference it would make. it just goes to show how much the electoral collage is not needed.

Just because of this, thing can get very confusing when it comes to voting. As bradford plumer states in paragraph 10 as well,"Can voters control whom thier electors vote for? not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate? sometimes." in this we can tell the conusion that the electoral collage may cause and once again, how it effects our vote for the canidate.

The electoral collage is difficult to be considered nessacary. not only because it may make voting a little difficult, but for the more important reason, we hve no say in what we vote. As citizens we should be able to have our voince heard. It is very important to select who will be your leader. this is why the electoral collage is not nessacary.
