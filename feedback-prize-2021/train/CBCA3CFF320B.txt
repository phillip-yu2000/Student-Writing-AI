Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games

instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students

would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall

for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to

attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because

he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left

without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c

Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up

with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream

and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call

her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley.

Lastly,students

would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for

biology and start staying home she get discourage

that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt

was telling her she does not have

enough money to pay for her to attend

the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning

is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.
