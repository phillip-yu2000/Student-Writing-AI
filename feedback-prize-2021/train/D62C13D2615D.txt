Have you ever wanted to join a school club? Too bad if you said no because you dont get a choice! The Principal's plan is flawed and quite simply wont work. It is riddled with issues.

The main reason it will fail is because it's taking away free choice. As a result, teens will do what teens are sterotypically known to do and rebel. Many students will probably intentionally not join clubs. The majority of students enjoy going home after school and they will be angered by this plan.

There would not be enough options of activities for people to join. Everyone has different interests and some people would be forced to join clubs they don't like or even want to be in. Also, clubs might fill up faster because everyone has to join something. A kid who really likes robots and is enthusiastic about joining robotics club could be unable to join because it's full with kids who don't even care about robots.

Many students do extracurricular activities but not through school. For example, stuff such as Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts. So kids could do lots of activities outside of school and be forced to do something that takes away what little of their free time remains. The school based activity could even conflict with a student's other activities.

School clubs are a very good way to meet new friends, have fun, and learn. School clubs can even help you find your passion. However, they should be joined on one's own terms.

In summary, schools should not dictate a student's after school life. Although the principal probably has good intentions his plan could have some consequences. So, for the sake of our our free will and free time oppose the plan.
