I believe asking for advice to multiple people is the best way to help you see all the options you have and do what's best for you. When people for ask advice they're looking for ways to help them decide or do something that their not sure what they decided on what's the best way to go. Advice is a lot of opinions , options , and ideas , all of those things can bring you to the best decision you can make but it could also be the worse decision of your life depending on who you listen to the most because not all advice is good. Which is why you should focus on what your asking advice for and from who are you asking advice to.

The good thing about asking advice is that it will give you the best opportunity to make the right decision. Its best to ask people who are close to you and know what kinda person you are. Family would probably the best choice because they grew up with you , know how you are, and know what's best for you .But If you don't have a family then you can ask a friend but make sure that your friend will not turn against you because if that happens the advice they give you can be a bad thing. If you don't knwo if your friend is a good person to ask from well you can compare the answer they give you from the one that your family gave you because friends are like family if your friend is truly your friend they will have kinda the same advice like your family did or even better. If you do that you will know that the answer your getting it's not just something random or unhelpful instead that its a good option to choose from.

Some people may think asking multiple people can be way too much pressure, and turn out to be a bad thing which sometimes can be true but you can always learn from those mistakes

.

It will be a lot of pressure to have a lot of different opinions from different people but isn't having to make a decision alone and not having but one or two options to choose from already pressuring enough

.

Maybe having more options will take some pressure off or it might add on to it but not everything is gonna be easy as pie

.

I think getting advice from multiple people and some of them being bad advice will be a great thing because then you will see the difference between good and bad

.

No one will ever learn anything by getting a few opinions from people and thinking there getting a better chance to get a good outcome out of that because is not all about them their decisions affects others too

.

Thats why not only you have to think about yourself when asking for advice but also ask people who you know will be affected by the choice you make

.

I have experience this before and let me tell you i wish someone said all of this to me back then. I had to make a decision between my boyfriend and my best friend. When me and my boyfriend started dating my best friend kept complaining that i hanged out more with him than her and that we barely see each other anymore, which was true. One day she told me i had to chose between them of who i wanted to be with because she wasn't gonna be waiting around for me to act like a friend. I thought it was dumb and she was way out of line but i had a few days to figure everything out. Of course i couldn't decide on my own so the only person i asked was one my other friends because she knew both my best friend and boyfriend. She told me if i was happy with my boyfriend that if my best friend is really my friend she should understand that and deal with it . I thought that made sense so thats what i told my best friend and she said "i understand your happy with him but what is what i don't understand is why you have to be with him all the time, but i guess you made your decision". Then she left before giving me a chance to say anything. I went home and started crying , my mom asked what was wrong and i told her everything that happened. She gave me some advice to what i should do and should've done and i started thinking that if i just would have asked my mom or anyone else for advice I wouldn't have lost my best friend. If that happened to me imagine of what other people been through or lost to just because they didnt ask other people for advice and didnt think they had many options.

In conclusion, seeking for advice to multiple people and get multiple opinions is the best choice you can make to make more better choices and not affect other people in a bad way. but doing that will not always turn out of be a good thing and it'll be okay because you still have the rest of your life to make up for it and get better at it

.

In order of you to get a good outcome out of that will be to make sure your asking the right kind of people like family, close friends, teachers ,any adult you can trust. Also be sure to ask the best amount of people because having more than one option is always for the best. If you try to decide something hard by yourself and end up decide wrong it will not just effect your life but also the people around you and maybe some people you dont even know.

Maybe you dont want to ask because you dont want to involve other people to it but for all you know they can already be involve so why not risk it. If the decision your asking advice for needs to or you want it to be a secret and asking one or none for advice will keep it that way thats just selfish because every secrets are gonna get out in some point and if your decision will affect other people then it shouldn't be kept secret. Some people dont ask for help because they think it makes you look weak even if some people see it that way its not it will be stressful and a lot pressure but nothing in life is simple and you'll never know if having multiple opinions from people will make you feel relive and it will give you the best opportunity to make the better choice.
