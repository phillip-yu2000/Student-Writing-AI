Driverless cars are the future of transportation and should continue to be developed. In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author offers several positive aspects of driverless cars.

Driverless cars allow the driver to bring in-car entertainment that use the heads-up display. This display dissappeares when the driver is need, making it a safety feature (Paragraph 8). This feature along with other technology keep the vehicle safe. The driverless cars use high-tech equipment such as sensors, cameras, a gps receiver, and lasers to allow safety for the passengers inside while the car drives itself. Some driverless cars can drive up to 90 percent of the time on their own, only needing the driver to take control in heavy traffic and heavy construction. Cars will be able to drive themselves at a higher percent of the time as technology advances. Several automotive companies, such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that fully drive themselves by the year 2020 (paragraph 10). These driverless cars would use half the fuel of todays cars and offer far more flexibility for public transportation than a bus.

Due to these reasons one can determine that driverless cars are the future of transportation and should continue to be developed and researched by automotive companies. These driverless cars would fundamentally change the world.
