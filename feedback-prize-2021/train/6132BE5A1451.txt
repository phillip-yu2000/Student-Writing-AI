Venus, our future sister home, is the second planet from our sun. To this day, Sicentists study its similarities to Earth's size and density. Most times Mars is closer to Earth or Earth is closer to Mars. Venus's atmosphere is different that Earth's, most of Venus's atmosphere is carbon dioxide. "The planet's surace, temperatures averge over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater thatn what we experience on our own planet." (The Challenge of Exploring Venus).

The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" well supports the idea that Venus is worth the pursuit. Though that Venus is Earth's twin, the obrit around the sun run at diferent speeds. Somtimes human minds turn towards Mars, others towards Venus, but Venus seems to be more suitble. Numerous of spacecrafts have been lanuched, but none survived the landing within hours. This became a challenge for humans to study for decades to come.

Venus's environment are more extreme compared to Earth. The planet's suface temperature is more hotter than the other planets in the solar system. Then why scientists bother to continue visits to its suface? Well, Venus, long ago, was once a Earth-like planet. It is said that Venus had oceans and various forms of life. This inspire astronomers.

NASA are coming up with idea that would help send humans to study Venus. Hover vehicles that would avoid ground conditions, 1800s mechanical computers to make calculations that don't require electronics. Today, Earth is running out of natural resources; trees are being cut down more than usually, pollution in the air then into the atmosphere, even worse ocean levels seem to rise. Solution are being made, but if time seems to run out and humans tend to find a planet similar to earth, then so be it.
