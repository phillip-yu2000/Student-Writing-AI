Dear Principal, I think policy 2 should be put into effect because there is no need to have cell phones at school and they just cause disturbances anyway. If kids were texting during their free time they might carry on a conversation into school time and get caught. That would be a big disturbance for the whole class.

Kids don't need to have cell phones in school because they usually text their friends who are already at school with them. Why not just walk over and talk to them; it's easier and a whole lot faster and you won't cause as near a big disturbance if you were just whispering to them in class.

Without cell phones kids couldn't send out big rebellious texts like what happened at our school. We had a big talk because one person decided to text everyone and tell them to do what the principal said not to do. The principal was very unhappy and banned a lot of clothing brands.

Another good reason to ban cell phones is because it prevents the kids from doing their work which in turn gets them bad grades. If someone is texting secretly instead of doing their work then they can't finish in time and that lowers their grades. Plus it distracts the person they're texting from doing their work also. So really for every person that texts in school it's lowering 2 people's grades.

I have a cell phone but I never use it during school unless someone sends me a text. Usually I don't even answer the text back. Texting can even distract kids that are smart and get good grades even though they don't send a text. These are a few reasons that i think cell phones should be banned from school.
