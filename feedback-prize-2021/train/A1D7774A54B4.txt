Did you ever think about what it would be like to live on Mars, well would about Venus? I think that exploring Venus is a good idea and should be done. One of my reason for wanting to study Venus is that Venus has some simullar traits to Earth. Another reason that we should explore Venus is to learn about are surrounding planets and expaned on are space tecknology to explore furher into space.

I think that we should explore Venus is that it is the most like Earth than any other planet in are solar system. In the text it states that Venus is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionaly the closest in distance too. The text also states that the panet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

I think that we should explore Venus to learn about are surrunding planets and expaned on are space tecknology to explore furher into space.. In the text it talks about how Venus is the closest and would help with space travel times. The text also talks about how Venus's atmosphere is almost 97 perecnt CO2 blankets. The text also talks about how they are looking into makeing a thing like a air blimp to float over the land about 30 miles high. The text also talks about them making a vehicle that can with stand the surface of Venus (which is around 800 degrees fahrenheit and enough air pressure to crush a submarine) for three weeks.

In conclusion I think that we should explore Venus more. For these reason of exploreing Venus for both its simuliays to Earth and for scientific space tecknology advances; I believe sending missions to Venus is important.
