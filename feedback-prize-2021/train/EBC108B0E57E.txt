Students should not be allowed to have phones at school at all. Bringing phones to school is a distraction. Phones could get stolen, and if students have time to be on their phone in school they probably wont turn them off in class. Phones are a huge distraction and texting has become one to. Students grades may fall dramatically due to the fact that they could possibly get away with texting in class. If a students phone was stolen then the parent would probably become very upset with the school board for allowing that to happen. Trying to get the phone back would be a useless attempts.

Having phones during lunch or at any free time is not a bad idea, but the problems that come with that are. Yes students would be excited that they could have their phones but it's a huge risk. There are many students who have failed to graduate because of failing classes, and being able to have your phone out at all or on your person at all again causes a distraction and could possibly lead to grades dropping dramatically. Students are the future of our would. We need doctors, scientists, vets, teachers etc. to have a successful future.

Now if you had everybody's cell phone in a box or something like that during classes and give them to the students during the free times that wouldn't be so bad, but there is always the possibility of losing a phone. With that said it isn't smart to have students with their phones out at all during school. The students may be upset with the decision of no phones but with explaining the reasonings for it their is a possibility that they understand why you chose that. Respect from other students is possible to. For some reason students bully others about their phones because "it isn't cool" so that could also prevent bullying.
