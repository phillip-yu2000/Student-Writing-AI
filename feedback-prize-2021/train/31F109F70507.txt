The Facial Action Coding System recognizes human emotions. It builds a 3-D computer model of the face. Which can detect the emotions of a human. It now being used in schools to detect the students facial expression.

The use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is not valuable, because its not going to help them with anything. Its not going to change how they feel, In paragraph 6 the author states that "Aclassroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused". The computer is not going to help them change their emotion.

Also, the computer is going to be able to recognize their emotions, but its not going to make them feel different. If the computer sees that a student is sad or mad, its not going to make them feel better. It is just going to know how they feel. Its not going help them at all. They are still going to do the same thing on the computer as they were before.

They detected the Mona Lisa painting. In paragraph 1 the author said that "she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry". That did not change how the painting looks. They just recognize how she was feeling. Its still the same painting as it was before. Her facial expression did not change at all. At schools computers are going to do the same, the students are not going to change how they look and feel.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable, because it is just going to detect how they feel. It is not going to really change anything. The system is not going to provide them with anything to make their emotions change. I feel like they should not have that, because they know how they are feeling and other people are going to know to.
