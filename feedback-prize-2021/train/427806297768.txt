Driverless cars can sound like a wonderful idea to most people, knowing they won't have to drive themselves anywhere anymore. They may even think that since it's driverless they can just sit there and play on their phone, not paying attention to anything on the road. Is that really as safe as they say it will be? Yes, you won't have to drive anywhere, but does that mean we should really trust it?

In my opinion, driverless cars sound dangerous. There are many questions asked that haven't been answered, which makes me feel uneasy. The BMW Traffic Jam Assistant sounds like a great idea. If that were in every car you buy now, I dont think we would even need driverless cars. That little modification to a car can make a big difference. I feel as if that would be safer than a self driving car.

In the driverless cars, a system would be powering and driving your car. What if that system malfunctions and/or has a glitch? Would it be the individuals fault or the manfacturers fault? This question has many different answers from different individuals. My answer would be that it would be the cars fault. It's not the individuals fault that the car had a huge malfunction in the system, it's the company's fault. The individual wasn't even driving the car to begin with. Now, if they make it to where the person can still control the car while the system is driving it, that's a different story.

In conclusion, driverless cars can be very dangerous. I feel that people should just drive themselves where they want to go. It's not that hard to drive yourself. the driverless cars that have a malfunction in the system could be a big problem when driving. The Traffic Jam Assistant would be a great idea for regular cars that you drive yourself. It would help with many things drivers never pay attention to now-a-days. Driverless cars should not make an appearance in the world, just to keep everyone safe on the road.
