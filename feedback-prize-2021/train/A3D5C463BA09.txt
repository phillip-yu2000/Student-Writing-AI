Would you beleve there are faces on Mars mad of rocks or made by some living creature? Some would think the NASA's photos of the face is made by living creatures. The photo first came about from the viking1 from 1976.

NASA has always had weird and unusal thing come from photos.

But in 1976

the Viking 1 undescoverd a face on Mars Viking 1 was snaping landing sites for its sister ship. When it took a photo of a mound that looked like a face. A few days later they put the photo out in public and they went crazy.

The MArs Global Surveyor in later years proved that it was just shoadows on a mound with a better camera it showed mor detail that it was just a mound of rock. There are people who still thing it is aleins. Even if there were objects with the camera you could see shack youcould see everything.

What the photo really shows is a bette or mesa landforms its a lava dome that takes the form of aan isolated mesa. these are common in the American West.

The "faces" are just showdows on a lava dome. The faces are just shadows on the lava dome. With the high reasolouton camera we proved that.
