The "face" is just a land form. You might ask why or maybe even how. Well one if NASA keeps saying that there is nothing there its just a face then yeah its just a land form shapped like a face. NASA would get a lot of money if they found some life form on a planet so they wouldnt keep it quiet. There are many land forms that look like that. So if the MGS on the planet kept looking it would find more land forms that looked like that. If it was an alien how is it still alive. All living things need water to survive. So wheres the water at? Also the people found beter cameras to use to take the picture. It was much clearer and you could tell it was just a land form. Michael Malin an his team messed up the first time because when they took the picture it was winter and very cloudy on the Red Planet. The camera lense had to look through shallow clouds to see the face. So some people said the alien face was hidden by haze. So Micheal Malin and his team tried again in April 8, 2001 to take another picture. It was perfect because it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The picture was clear perfect nothing could have told you that, that was an alien face. Some even said it looks like something here on earth. Either a pyramid in Egyptian time or maybe even a mountain. You can make up myths and say that its an alien face, but all the facts say that its just a land form. The land form that looks like a face. It is the "face" that helped NASA look closer at there pictures and work on there camera work. The "face" has helped people learn more about the night sky and the planets and even the world. But the "face" is just a land form.
