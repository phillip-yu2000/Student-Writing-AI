The Seagoing Cowboy program is hard work but it is pretty fun. You get to help people that endured the 1945 World War 2 restock on food, animals, and more. All of us together make 44 nations that have joined together to help the people in need. The Seagoing Cowboys were part of the UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) organization. A Seagoing Cowboy will take care of the animals including the horses, young cows, and mules that are on board. You get to see amazing monuments and you get to sight see and have fun. This is an opportunity of a lifetime so you should join this amazing program.

One of the reasons that you should join the program is because while you are working, you get to enjoy the wonderful views that the ocean gives you and you get to see building that you would have to pay a lot of money for. I got to see Europe, China, and the Acropolis in Greece. When you are having a bad day you can just look out and see the beautiful sunset and marvel the sights that you can look upon.

Another reason is once the animals are unloaded, you are able to find some time to yourself and have fun on the ship. You are able to play baseball, volleyball, and tennis. The Cowboys also did fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass time. You would find an empty stable and gather a few people to play with you.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboy program to help the UNRRA. You will enjoy having lots of fun with us but not only that, you can see marvelous evenings and daylights. You can also admire the beautiful buildings the you will see on the trips that you take.
