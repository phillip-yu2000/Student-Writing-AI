I the first paragraph it says ' Luke Bomberer had no idea his life would change soon after his high school graduation he was working two prat-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Eurpe on a cattle boat Luke couldn't say no He knew it was an opportunity of a life time.

That is how it began but. In paragraph 2 says. It was 1945 World War 2 was over in Eurpe and many countries were left in ruins to help these countries recover their food supplies animals and more 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Abministration) UNRRA hired

Seagoing Cowboys to take care of horses young cows and mules that were shipped overseas Luke and Don signed up. That is when Luke become a Seagoing

Cowboy. And in paragraph 4 says. Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece which meant he could be drafted for military service When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip they told me to just keep Doin that for my service By the time he was discharged in 1947 Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboys.
