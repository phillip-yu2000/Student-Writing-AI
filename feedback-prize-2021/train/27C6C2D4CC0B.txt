Dear principal,

I believe policy 2 is the best way to go because not every student breaks the rules and texts during class and it just would not be fair to them if they cannot bring their phones period. If you go with policy 2 you can just look over your class every so often to make sure no one has their cell phone out. You could also let the class know that they can check their phones during lunch and free time so there is no need to be checking them during class. You should be able to trust them to follow those rules because they know and should be grateful that they can check them during free times.

Another reason why i think policy 2 is the best idea is because students need the cell phones that their parents provide them with to communicate with them throughout the day. They may also need it after school to call their parents to see how they are getting home, and if they don't have their cell phones there is no way they will know what to do or where to go after school.

plus, they would need to call their parents if anything dangerous was going on at the school and it went on lockdown. Parents would be devastated if something bad happened to their child during a time like that and they didn't know because no one had a cell phone to call them. This is what i believe so i hope this letter has helped you and you can take it into consideration.

sincerely,
