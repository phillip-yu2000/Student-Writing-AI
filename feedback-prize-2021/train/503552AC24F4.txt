community service is a good thing to do but some kids just need to take care of other things like watching little brothers or sisters while your mother is a way working and i think that community service should only if the children volunteers in this. The children should not be forced to do this and also this can be used as a punishment if the boy or girl has done some thing really bad to were it goes to a point the child must perform community service for an mount of time depends on what they have done but. Community service is a good thing for the school and if the service is recycle things you find at your school floor maybe there can be a class for this. Were the students go and help the school by cleaning up trash up off the floor and putting the right items in the right bin or clean the windows and other things like help teachers file things and do things like a T.A. But the students must be the ones that volunteer in this or it can be used as extra credit for some classes and that way students will join in and help by doing community service at there schools or at home. community service can help you and help others around you and might enjoy the school or were ever you are helping at and by you doing this you not only help others and your self but you are also helping the earth be a better place. For all that live on it and have fun livening there lives with there parents and or friends.
