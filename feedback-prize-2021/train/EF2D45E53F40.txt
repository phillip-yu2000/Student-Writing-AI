I think that they should only do that if they want to because you should not be forced to do any thing. But i think if they got in a fight or just a bad kid I would agree that they should do community service on school grounds because OSS is just happy for those kids and they are fine with that. If we are talking about kids who are good in school and they pick up after them self then I would say that it should be an option if somebody does not want to help because you do not know what they do when they get home i know that the younger kids in k through 5 have to have somebody their when they get off the bus so that's why I think the principle has any right to tell a kid that they have to do community service when they have done nothing wrong. How would the principle feel if the board of ed called him and said that he has to clean all the toilets before he goes hone and he's got 3 kids then he cant get home. So I think that it is not fair at all for the principle to tell the students what they have to do. I think that it is great they want to help but everyone should not be told what to do like i under stand if it is our parents because they are feeding us housing us and also clothing us when they say pick the trash up an all of the other stuff. But a principle someone that you do not even know that well tells you what to do when they don't do that much for you that is the only reason i would have to agree with the students if you are busy then that is fine but if you do want to help that is also great for you but i don't agree with what the principle is saying and i think that he should just say no and not even have to think about it for a second they are kids not adults and i think that would be consider a physical punishment because you could get injured and you never know what might happen. If they are a bad kid why would you leave them their alone and you would have to pay a teacher extra to stay their longer. So that is what i think about this whole thing.
