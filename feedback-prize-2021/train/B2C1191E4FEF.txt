It is wise that election is chosen by popular vote. I think that it should be kept this way, and all that are Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote. Election by popular vote is an easier choice and makes things more simple. It could give candidates more of a chance to get elected. Time would be wisely saved if all states had the same system, it would give people more of a chance to get elected.

In the Electoral College voters vote for a portion of electors, not the president. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, this process is just undated and not right. A lot of states may not even see their candidates. If election by popular vote is used more than the places that don't, then they should be changed.

It is just easier to decide when there are more or less voters. The Electoral College just has less of a chance to be kept. If every state did the same to elect then it would be easier to decide who should be the president of the United States.
