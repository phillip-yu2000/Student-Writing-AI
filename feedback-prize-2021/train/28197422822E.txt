The Face on Mars

The face on Mars is a mysterious object Mainly because how it resembles a human face from the first picture in 1976 but that picture is outdated. One of the most recent picture taken in 2001 shows that the "face" is actually just a landform that appears on Earth and it is common in the American West. This landform is that appears commonly on Earth is known as a mesa. If the face on Mars was proof of an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would have better funding than it allredy has and there would be more exploration on Mars.

Although the Face on Mars has become an icon in pop culture that dosen't change the fact that it is just a mesa and at that time the camera wasn't nearly as advanced as what we have now.

The combination of cameras that werent nearly as good as the cameras that we have now and the shadows that the image had on it made it look very similar to a human face when NASA first took a picture of the mesa. More current pictures show that what looks like a human face in one picture actually is an average land formation on our own planet. So in conclusion the Face on Mars is nothing more than a naturial land formation that can happen on Mars and Earth.
