Dear Principle of The School,

I think you could go with policy number two because no teenager has a use for it when you go to school. For example, a teenager doesn't need a phone during school hours, if a teenager needs to use a phone he/she could ask the teacher if he/she could use it for emergency reasons. Another example is that, if a teenager wants to text a friend he/she could do it when they arrive at their house to text them all about their day at school or something.

Texting or calling in school is a big distraction for their education in school. A person can live if they don't text or call for at least eight or ten hours can't they? If they could then why bring a phone to school if you know the teacher is going to take it from you. I mean I don't want to lose my one hundred twenty dollar phone to the school or drop it and not even know i did these are some two reasons why i wouldn't want to bring my phone to the school.

Education always comes first is what my parents say about school, so if i need to text someone, i can hang on to it for a while and get my education first, so i can achieve in life and get a job so I can pay for the bills myself and not waste my mom and dad's money on my own phone bills. So if you have to pick from one policy from another, i hope you vote for policy number two because it is better for the student to not be distracted from their learning curricular/education.
