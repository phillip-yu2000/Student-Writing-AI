Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think the principal should let the kids bring there cell phone to school. Because if something happened to the kids mom or dad and cant get in touch with the kid its the schools problem. The kid should be able to bring there cell phones to school and not keep it off they should keep it on low or on vibrate so they can feel it.

If the kid does have it in school the teachers should not tack it away because the teachers can use there cell phones when they want so can the kids. Not only do they use it they start to text to there friends and for a little part of a cell phone the teacher sees they think they have the right to take it. Its not right they should not take it because we don't take there phones away and never give it back. That's another thing they take the kids cell phone and they say come at the end of the day to pick it up. You go to get it and they say no come with your mom or your dad to pick it up. Last time I got my cell phone taken away by the assistant principal she went and started to read my text. My aim and the recent calls I got and calls i have recently made.

How would the teachers like it if the kids take there cell phones away and look at there recent calls and there recent text they would not like that now would they. So they should stop tacking our phones and but out of our business.
