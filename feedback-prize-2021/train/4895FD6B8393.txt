In my opinion, I feel like they shouldn't bother to use the technology because what is it going to solve? I think it pointless, because nobody will speak up on how they feel in the classroom infront of everyone in there. It would probably say how they feel out loud, and maybe someone doesnt want to be pointed out. "You can tell how someone feels by their actions and look on their face", I don't think they'd need a "robot" to understand how someone feels in that exact moment. I think teachers or whoever themselves should go up to that person and have a proivate conversation, some teachers see the facial expressions on some students and wont bother to ask. I feel like the technology would be expensive as well and they would need a lot of them. It would just be a waste of money. Plus, it goes by your facial expressions. I don't believe it would actually tell you how you feel. In the passage it says " even though individuals show varying degress of expression"(like not smiling as broadly) using video imagrey the new emotion-regognition software tracks these facial movements" so it's basically saying if someone fakes a smile it would tell them because how 'powerful' the techonolgy is, but a lot of people are really good at faking smiles and frowns.

Also, once the technology tells you how you feel what's going to make it better. How can the "Mona Lisa demonstration bring a smile to your face by just looking at it". I don't think it's possible, I personally think it wont solve a person's feelings at all, I think its pointless. Some people also fake emotions for attention,so that would be a con about the tecnology.
