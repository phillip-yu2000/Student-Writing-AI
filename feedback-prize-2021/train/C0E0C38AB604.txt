In my opinion the Facial Action Coding System technology is a great valuable and reliable application for students to get into, I say this because not only does it sound smart, but Dr. Huang gives much details about the invention and explains how the model works when recognizing emotions. Dr. Huang sticks to his topic of the Facial Action Coding System, he has predictions about it as well by saying that "it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, also gets into human and emotional communication. The 6 types of basic emotions are also discussed in this article and they're happiness, suprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness. Although many are associated with facial movements which are the types of feelings and the type of reaction someone gives when feeling these types of ways.

Dr. Huang gives more brief discriptions of this technology by explaining how humans perform the same impressive "calculation" every day then after supporting his claim he gives examples to inform humans about the technology. Dr. Huang wants to make sure he is doing his best on explaining the theory of emotions and the information explained is a perfect example to set to intrest and to make sure these are valuable. These are the many reasons why I am for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional claims.

These theory of emotions could work for some students and not work for others, I say this beacuse there are different types of people in the world with different types of situations in life. Although Dr. Huang technology sounds great it might not be the best option for every student, but he still makes a great administrator and a great leader to me in my opinion. This technoology sounds like an amazing experiment to have and try, so this is why I am all for the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions.
