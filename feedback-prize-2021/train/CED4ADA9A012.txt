To the Principal ;

I think that community service is an important job and should be taken seriously, but others may not. I think you should make community service optional for many reasons, one being the fact that some people may not like it and just bring negativity to the whole process. I

think community service should be a good thing and no one would want a negative person there, bringing everyone down with them. Also the people volunteering wouldn't want a negative, unwilling person brought there by obligation instead of pure will helping out if they really wont help anyone. Another reason I think that community service should be optional is, that the people being forced to do it may just skip out and leave. This would bring false hope to the people or causes being helped and that would be rude. To prevent this I say we should make community service optional, to save others feelings and to prevent negativity.
