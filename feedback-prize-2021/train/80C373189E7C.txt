Thousands of people around the world use cars. It's an all-around good mode of transportation. Unfortunately, the fumes that cars emit are harmful for the environment. There are ways to limit car usage. Limiting car usage has many benefits such us the decrease in greenhouse house gas, the decrease in smog, and resources are conserved.

First off, reducing the usage of cars can cut the amount of greenhouse gas produced dramatically. One can easily cut down on car usage by using other means of transportation such as : riding bike, riding the train, and plain walking. Greenhouse gas emissions are very harmful and are mostly caused by car emissions. Around fifty percent of passenger cars are responsible for these gasses (source 1.) If we limit car usuage we can promote a healthier environment.

Additionally, reducing car usuage also cuts down smog. Smog is another deadly gas that isnt just dangerous to the environment, but also to us. Smog is polluted air which can cause sickness. Many cities around the world are increasing in smog due to the overusuage of cars. For example Paris almost broke the record for polluted air, which is held by China, one of the most polluted cities in the world (source 2.) If we reduce the usuage of cars, we promote cleaner air for ourselves. Just by limiting the car usuage for five days in Paris, the smog went down sixty percent (source 2.) The advantage of limiting car usuage would be cleaner air.

Finally, limiting car usuage is beneficial because it conserves resources. If we dont rely on cars, we could make cities more compact (source 1.) Therefore reducing the amount of land destroyed to build malls, highways, and houses. This would save tons of resources that were going to be used on building and natural resources (source 4.) Limiting car usuage would improve life all around.

All in all, the limit on car usuage would benefit the environment, it would benefit our health, and it would aid the conservation of resources.       Â
