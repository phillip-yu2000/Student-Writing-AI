dear TEACHER_NAME,

I don't think it's right to do our class mates and your students like that .Just because some of us students have a c average on our work that don't mean they cant play .I thin you should be able to play with a c average it ain't like we have d or an f if so can you please let students that are trying they best on work. there are a lot of talented people in the SCHOOL_NAME . just think and remember when you was little and you wanted to try out for something an they didn't let you because you had 1 c now how did you feel. I know you was mad cause that's how some of these students feeling when you made that enouncement saying no body can play with a c just think a look at this cause there are students that really wanted to play sports and they can't only just because you said what you said.
