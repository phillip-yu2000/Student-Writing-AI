Luke in the story A Cowboy Who road waves is a Young Adult who had just got out of high school. Luke was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and in a bank. Don his friend had invited him to go to Europe in a cattle boat. Luke did not give this opportunity up.

UNRRA also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation hired the "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas.

The Seagoing Cowboys had recieved their orders to repot to New Orleans. They had arived August fourteenth. When they got the seaman's papers they boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed for Greece. Their cargo was full of 335 horses plus tons of hay and oats to feed them.

Luke had been given a great opportunity for a small-town boy. It took the Seagoing Cowboys two weeks to get acroos the the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Luke kept busy by feeding and treating the animals on the cattle boat.

And at the end Luke says that he is grateful for the opportunity that he had to get on and ride that cattle boat. This concludes to my opinion that you don't have to always be someone special to get good things.
