Dear Principal,

I agree with Policy 1. Most students have cell phones now a days, and use them quite often. If there is an emergency and you need to talk to your parents, you could just use your phone. If you ask your teacher to use your the teacher's class room phone, they may not allow you to use it, thinking its not important. But if you're allowed to use them during lunch periods or other free times, you wouldn't have to wait to tell your parents the emergency.

Another reason, is if you have forgotten something at home that you need immediately, you could use your cell phone. If you have forgotten an assignment due that day, you would need to call a parent to see if they can bring it to you. You may not be able to ask your teacher to borrow the class room's phone, so you would need your phone to use.

I believe as long as the phone is not being used during class, or interrupting a class, it may be used during another time in the day except when you are learning in class. If they are not using the phone during class, there is no harm on anyone, so what they should be allowed to use it another time in the day.

Sincerely,

A student regarding the school's cell phone policy
