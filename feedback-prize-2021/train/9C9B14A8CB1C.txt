The author explains how venus is the closest planet to earth by explaining the similar things venus has and that earth does. venus is a very complicated planet to try to study because of its tempeature the average rate goes up to 800 degrees and also has a thick atmosphere and has alot of pressure. venus is also known as the hottest planet out of all the others.

the author also says its a challenge for humans because humans havent encountered those types of enviorments but they are willing to learn more about it because its the only like earth planet there is known to be around and humans are anxious to know more about it.
