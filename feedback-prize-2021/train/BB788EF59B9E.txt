I think that the principal should allow students to use cell phones at school during all lunch, including times such as locker time, changing classes, and before school. This would be helpful because if a student left there school work for there next class at home, instead of asking there teacher to go to the office and call home, they can call home from there cell phone and save most of the hassle of going to the office. The phone could also serve as a mobile dictionary by using the internet on your phone you can find definitions on words that you don't know the meaning of.

During lunch phones can serve as ways to past the time when your finished eating, be used as communication instead of yelling across the lunch room, and used as communication out side as well. For example, when you can't find somebody outside or inside, you can simply send them a text asking them where they are and the can reply within moments.

Another reason to allow having cell phones at school is if a sports practice has been canceled, you can call your parents and tell them that practice has been canceled and they need to get to school earlier. Or, if your bus is late, you can call them to pick you up when possible.
