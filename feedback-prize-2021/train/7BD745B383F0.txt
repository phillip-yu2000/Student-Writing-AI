Hi my name is Luck Bomberger and as you may know i have crossed the Altantic Ocean 16 time. Why? You might ask because i wanted to help people recover from War World ll. And i could also trave the world.

While helping so many people i was able to see Europe and China. While in Italy I took a ride in a Venice, Italy a city with streets of watere. It was amazing not only did i see amazing places but I was able to work with a lot of amazing animals.

It took to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean for the east coast of the United States and a mouth to get to China. But carry for the aniamls took a lot of work. I had to feed them and clean up there mess. But working in my Aunt Katie's farm when i was younger helped me a lot.

We also had a lot of fun off the boat to. When we let the aniamls of the ship we woiuld us the empty holds to play games like Vollyball and Baseball. but i have also got hurt in the ship where i have broke my rips.

So in conclusion, there where good times and bad times while on board and being able to help people but there homes and towen back together was a opportunity of a liftime and im clad I was able to do it with my Friend Don.
