Dear Principal,

Have you noticed that lately there is not a clean road in sight, and that many children's grades are dropping because of lack of academic help?

I have definitely noticed this change in the past few years and believe that as the people of the community, we should help solve these problems and many other issues by performing community service.

It is a small thing that takes very little time and makes a very big difference,

I also understand that many adults, like yourself, do not have the time to go and pick up trash on the side of the road, but on the other hand children and young adults like me have much free time normally wasted watching television.

I believe that it would be towards everybody's benefit if we required students to participate in community service.

This would keep them from getting into trouble and it is not an activity that only has one option.

They could go help the elderly in a nursing home, pick up trash on a highway, tutor younger students, become a volunteer life guard, and many others.

This would greatly help everyone.

It is your duty your to ensure the quality education we look for in a school system and by placing the rule of having to do community service you are not only preparing the children with knowledge of the outside world, you are making them a better person.

Your community will thank you greatly for teaching their children to be great people and to work hard to ensure success.

Sincerely,
