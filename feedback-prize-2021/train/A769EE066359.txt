I am totally against driverless cars. There are so many reasons why. I think they could be extremely dangerous if something with the computer driven cars fails and stops working and why on earth would you not want to drive a car! It's really not that difficult at all. Have we really become this lazy that we dont even want to operate a vehicle anymore. Computers always crash and fail, so what is going to happen if the computer driven cars stop working. There could be a huge wreck or accident.

When we drive we are relaxed, calm and focused. We are paying attention and seeing everything around us. There is a less amount of chance of us wrecking than a computer. I also like the idea of having my own car. I would not want to call a driverless cab to take us wherever I desire. I would not want to have to wait for the cab to get to my house instead of just stepping into my garage and getting into my car.

In my opinion driverless cars are irrelivant. Teens would much rather feel important and useful driving their own car. That is one of the tings us teens, I think cant wait for. It's The moment you get your liscence and learn to drive and become great at it and have the freedom to drive youreself to wherever it is you want to go without haveing to depend on your parents to take you somewhere or pick you up. Parents would also feel safer on driving themselves and their children places. I would not trust nor let no computer take my child nowhere.

We can't let technology take over our future and our lives. I think it is time we put an end to this and start using our hands more often and we also need to stop depending so much on technology. One very important way we all learn repsoniblities starts by driving. We do not depend on anyone for a ride and we feel responisble. I think responisblity is one of the main things we all need to have, so please do not get yourself a driverless car if you want to be the responsible person you can be without relying on technology.
