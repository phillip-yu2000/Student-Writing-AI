Is Studying Venus a worthy pursuit?

In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents; although, venus is very dangerous, Venus is known that it could of once been just like Earth. Even though its known that it could been just like Earth many years ago scientist still dont have enough evidence to proof that it was just like Earth many years ago.

Venus is often refered as Earth's "twin" because Venus is the closest planet to earth in density and size. If its like earth in many ways why is it so dangerous? Venus is the hottest planet out there; although Mercury is the clostes to the sun venus is still the hottset plantet in our solar system. Venus temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit. These condition are very extreme that no human could live there if they wanted too.

"if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface?", scientists or Astronomers are fascinated by venus because its the most earth-like planet in the solor system. Venus has rocky sediments on its surface and also has familar featrues such as vallys, craters, and mountians.

futhermore, NASA has been thinking of ways to figure out how we could get on Venus and maybe live there in the futrue. If NASA didnt think it was a good idea they wouldn't have kept trying to find ways to get there with no harm to the equitment or anything living. For example, NASA has been making simplified electronics made out of silicon carbide and has gone far enough to test them in venus like conditions to see posible ways to getting there safe.

In conclusion, Venus is very dangerous but it is worthy enough to try to study. Futhermore, NASA is still trying to find ways to get there which probably means it could be a good thing in the future and could benifit Earth someday.
