When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas. For example, Generic_Name wanted to plan a birthday party but she needs help on what theme she wants for her party. Generic_Name asks her mom, dad and her friends. They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue!

I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people don't have ideas of something they need help with. Some people need a better choice, so its better to ask other people then just think of your own ideas because hearing other people's thoughts can make your ideas better. I think people should always give at least another person's thoughts on what they need help with. It is always best to get another persons idea. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence on what they need advice on.

Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas.
