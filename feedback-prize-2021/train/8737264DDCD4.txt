Do you ever feel like you have a lot on your plate or you can never get things done? Well your not the only one alot of other students have the same problem as you. Honestly students should not have to participate in extracurricular activities afterschool if they do not want to.

Some students can't just stay afterschool just because the principle wants them to and most of them have to take care of younger siblibgs afterschool. Around this age students start getting little side jobs to save up for things they may want so stay afterschool would not be an option.

Just because students don't stay after school doesnt mean they dont have nothing to do students also have sports and other activities to do outside of school. It could also be hard for students due to lack of transportation from school back home.

Students have other things they need to worry about instead of just going to stay afterschool for sports and other activites. Students may or may not want to actually be in a extracurricular activity but that should be left for them to decide themselves not the school.
