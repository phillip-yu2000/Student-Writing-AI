Limiting car usage is great way to start helping out our planet in many ways. It's called "smart planning" that is a movement to separate suburban life from auto use in Europe. In many countries, cars are creating one major problem in our environment, which is air pollution.

The main cause why we should abstain ourselves from car usage is to reduce air pollution. Paris is one of the most European capitals that has the most smog in the city. Due to the excess of air polluted, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear out the city. If we take efforts forward, greenhouse gas emisssions can decrease.

The advantages we take of limiting car usage is less congestion on the streets, ride our bikes or go walking which is very healthy too."It's a good opportunity to take away stress" (source number 3). In Bogota, Columbia there's a program in which a day where people hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work to limit traffic jams, others who violate to complete this will be fined $25. Since a lot of people were participating, other cities were enthusiastic about this event and joined. It's time to take act and make a change for our environment.
