The electoral college should be eliminated. It should be changed to popular vote for the presidential election. With the electoral college, people don't get to have the freedom to vote for who they want to be elected. Instead they vote for a slate of electors who in turn, elect the president for you. There are a few problems with this. One, the electors could end up not doing their job. They might refuse to vote for their party's candidate and end up voting for whomever they please. That could turn into a riot or just leave a lot of people very unhappy. The electors could also mess up their vote and end up voting for the wrong candidate. Say they are loyal to the president they are suppose to vote for, but then end up choking and voting for the opposing president. Further more, what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. ("What's wrong with the electoral college") Another thing is a tie could happen. A tie in the electoral vote means that the election then gets handed to the House of Reprsentatives, where they will then vote on the president of their choice. Either way the people do not get a say on who they want for president. It is all in the hands of people that can turn their backs on who they promise they will vote for, and end up voting for the opposing president. If the people got to choose who they wanted to be president, then we wouldn't run into any of these problems. There would never be any ties or broken promises. The electoral college is "unfair, outdated, and irrational." The electoral college should be abolished.       Â
