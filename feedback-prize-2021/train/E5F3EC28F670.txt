Dear, senator the Electorial College should be riden of. The people do not have much of a vote. We actaully vote for our candidates electors, the defenses of the system is wrong, and the winner-take all system is unfair. The people should make their own decisions and not be fooled about it.

We are told our vote counts. We have been fooled. We do not vote for the president directly. We vote for the state of electors who elect the president. These electors are our candidates electors. The electors could turn the other way and vote for the other candidate. It almost happened in 1960. The Office of the Federal Register states that the Louisiana legislature almost used new electors for the Demeocratic electors who would have opposed John F. Kennedy. He would have not had a popular vote. So, ask yourself, who do we really vote for?

The defenses of sytems is a joke. The most popular vote of a candidate should be who wins. The Office of the Federal Register described a situation in 2000 Al gore won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. It is a shame that this can happen. Now, ask youself, why can we not have the say on who is president?

Candidates do not spend any time in states they think will not win due to the winner-take-all system. Their main focus are on the "swing" states. As if we do not matter. The Office of the Federal Register says in the year 2000 campaign seventeen of the states did not see the candidates, and twenty-five of the largest media markets did not see a campaign add at all. Again, think about it and ask yourself, do we really matter?

It is not fair that we are underminded and fooled. we should have a say and not the electors. The people should have the power. The electorial College is outdated and should be riden of. It is our time.
