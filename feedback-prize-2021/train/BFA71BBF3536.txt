The electoral colleges shouldn't be taken away. Just because of its minnor flass it still should be keept because of the "winner-take-all" system it just awards electors to the winning presidential candidate. The out comes of the electoral colleges are almost certain and no hassels to figure out who won and who didn't. Also it is less likely for there to be a run-off election because of the balance in the electoral colleges.

But it just can't be perfect there also some deffects like when under the eloctoral colleges you don't voto for the president, but for a slate of electors which they vote for the president if the got the most votes. Also the electors can vote for whom they want so even if who you voted for got the most votes the elector might choose a different president. Ading to that there has been some errors like two slates of electors beingt sent to Congress.

There is also an oposite side to this and it is the people who don't want to vote under electoral colleges. Because they want themsels to choose the president but some times this also back fires because there is no controll over who they choose there can be a winning land slide or a tie then it will take way more time to choose who will be the president. Besides the majority of the population wants direct vote because they feel in comtrol of who will make it or not.
