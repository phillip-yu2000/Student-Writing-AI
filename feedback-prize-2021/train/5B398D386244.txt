Driverless cars are a very interesting but not something I'm ok with want happening. I'm not saying I'm superstitous but something bad will come from these driverless cars. I'm against driverless cars because hackers and the possible future that will come from this starting point. Other than that, I don't care for what it does or who gets it.

One of my reasons for rejecting driverless cars is hackers. I know not many people have hacker issues but the possibilty is still there. Hackers are becoming smarter each day as technology advances. What if hackers can get into the cars systems? I don't know about you but I find this very uncomfortable. Then there is the possibilty of technology rising up against us like the movie I-robot.

My second reason for rejecting driverless cars is the future this could lead us to. The movie Wall - E for explain. To me, I see our technology taking over what use to be our active lives. To be honest, this is the most laziest generation I've ever seen. We will start to become lazier and fatter because of it. That's what I see happening because driverless cars will start the chain reaction for that.

In conclusion, driverless cars are bad for an average human. Only reason I agree to have driverless cars are for those who are blind or have some form a disability. Other than that, I see no true reason for this invention. The more inventions I see for things to make something easier to be done, the more I will cringe on the inside and be vocal about it. Those inventions just prove we humans want to take the easy way out for everything.
