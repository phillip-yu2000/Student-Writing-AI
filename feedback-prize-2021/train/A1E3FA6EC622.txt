I think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity. First it could interfear with there scedule, second it could get in the way of school and lastly it could induce stress.

First the childs scedule. Some children are busyer than other so there could be a posibility that that he or she well not have enough time for that activiy. Next the activity could be to early for the child and they might have to wake up earlier than anticipated and not feeling as energized for the day ahead. Then the activity could start or end late which would cause the child to lose precious hours of sleep.

Second it could cause the children to start academicaly failing due to say not haveing enough time to study for a quiz or haveing enough time to do homework. This could also have a major impact on the students gardes causeing the to drop dramaticly. Time that cuts into school also cuts into time to study. Studying time is very crushial because it helps the child to remember the material for there quizes and tests. Finally it could take up sleep time which could posibly make that child tired and sluggish in school witch would cause the student not to do as well in shcool as if he or she were well rested and had an desent amount of sleep that night.

Third is that some kids dont do extracurricular activites is that it causes stress. The activites could cause the child to lost sleep and that could leave the child tired and stressed for the rest of there school day. Next it could cause to much stress and that can lead to unwanted sideffects, like hair lost pail coloring of skin, hair loss and suicidal thoughts which isnt good.

Thats whyI think that kids shouldnt have to do more than one extrasurricular activity.Â
