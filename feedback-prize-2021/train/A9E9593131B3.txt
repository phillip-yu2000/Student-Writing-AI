People are arguing about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popualr votes for the president of the United States. How do we know which one is better or safer? Well, what's it going to be? Keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular votes for the president of the United States?

In the text In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the presiden it states that, "The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popualr votes the winner." This means that The Electoral College is like a person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and it doesnt fit into the president. It aslo states that the advocates of the position are correct for agruing that the Electoral College is not a modern sense, it's the electors who elect the president, not the people.

In the text The indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong states that " It's official: The electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational." This means that people now know the truth, they think that it is unfair and will not listen to your opinion or anything you have to say about the president or senators you elect.
