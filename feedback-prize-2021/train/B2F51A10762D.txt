Do you believe in being active or socializing. Many people dont like to do extracurricular activities. I agree that all students have to participate in at leastÂ one extracurricular activity because the students can make new friends or have the opportunity to get in shape.

One of the reasons you have to do an extracurricular activity is you can make friends. For example, you can talk to other students while you help make the yearbook or play in teams in a sport. My Cousin used to be super shy, but when he played in extracurricular activities he made plenty of friends.

Another reason to do an extracurricular activity is that you can get in shape. For example, if your extracurricular activity is sports you can work out your muscles. My sister used to hate her body, until she chose track as an extracurricular activity and started to losing weight.

Many people love to play sports or help make yearbooks. Extracurricular activities are very helpful. I agree that students should do at least one extracurricular activity because the students can get in shape or can make friends.
