"Making Mona Lisa Smile" is about a computer hat can tell our emotions.

Today technology is really big and and has gotten better over the years, they made a computer to read peoples emotions by the way their face looks.

If school had this computor in the class rooms to read when people is confused or happy or sad may be helpful to the teacher. Some people don't like expresing there feelings because they see it as an attion graber. If they had this computor the tacher will know when the person doesn't understand something.

I honestly dont know how good it will work becuse some people can fake like if they understnd things and how they are happy but they really dont or aren't. If Dr. Huang and his college experts think it will work i think we should all give it a try and see how it works. If you arent undertsnding something it will change your paragraph so maybe you will understand so i think it will help alot of people out.
