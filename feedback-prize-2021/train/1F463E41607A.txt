Driverless cars aren't a new topic to the automotive world. They weren't as advanced as they were now, but now they're much more advanced and more practical. Since we're in the modern era I can fully understand why people just want to hurry to make cars that drive themselves, but it just doesn't seem very practical. Driverless cars would have more faults than benefits to the road.

People just want to upgrade everything without seeing the faults in evolving. For example, the car still needs a driver to manage it, so why do you need to upgrade if it doesn't even fulfill its own namesake? The limited automotive use really just puts the driver at more risk, because of the possibility of a malfunction. On that note since the cars are lined with high tech equipment, and whatnot wouldn't the accident in that kind of vehicle be more severe? Something could explode, and injure much more than the drivers. This also would make one of these cars far more difficult to replace as it states in the article. With it being filled with sensors, and other high tech equipment this could lead to 100's of thousands of dollars being thrown out the window for repairs.

In the end the benefits of having a driverless car are outweighed by the faults.

The call is still pretty tough, since the idea is still underexplored as a whole. For all we know the problems could get worked, but manual cars won't become obsolete. Manual cars still retain the more benefits in my mind.
