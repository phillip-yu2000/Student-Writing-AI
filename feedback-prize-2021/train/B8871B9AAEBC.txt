I believe self -driving cars can be useful if they are made right. Self-driving cars can be beautiful thing, they could cause less acccidents beacue there would be no user error, driving drunk, falling asleep behind the wheel, and no texting while driving could savge lives. All of these things gone from driving sounds great but, if you have to stay alert and watch the road as if you're driving the car then whats the point in a "self-driving" car?

Yes self-driving cars do decrease the risk of user error accidents but, as soon as the car tells you to grab the wheel because you need to drive the risk of those accidents go right back up. Yeah self-driving cars is a cool concept and, it would be nice to not have to drive all the time. With the thechnology we have now it wouldn't really be a self-driving car. It would be more like a car that drives its self until it thinks it is "too dangerous" for it to drive. So then you would have to start driving and we're back to square one. Why sit there and hold onto a wheel but not actually control the car? I don't want to sit there and have to act like im driving even though I'm not. That doesn't sound enjoyable to me at all.

If sitting in car acting like your driving but, not actually driving it sounds enjoyable to you then be my guest and buy yourself a "self-driving" car. I think if they made self-driving cars so advanced that they actually self-drive and the person in it doesn't have to do anything then it would be woth creating. Self-driving cars that require you to act like youre driving incase its "too dangerous" don't sound like a "self-driving" car to me.
