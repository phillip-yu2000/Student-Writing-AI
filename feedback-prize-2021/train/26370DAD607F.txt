Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think community service is great it helps make our town, schools and community look good.

If a student or person does something wrong then they should have to do community service to show them what they did is wrong but if people want to do community service just cause they want to help our town/city or schools/businesses. if someone likes to work with kids then they could help by tutoring or by helping a person watch there kids for no cost or charge. If a person likes animals then they could volunteer at the local animal shelter. There are so many things to do for community service there ; picking up trash at a populated place, painting over graffiti, and a lot more stuff for community service.

so i think that community service should be voluntary or mandatory for people who have do something wrong that cant be fixed or forgotten.

Everyone should have there own opinion on the way they feel about having to do something that they don't want to do or if they want to do community service.

Thank you ,
