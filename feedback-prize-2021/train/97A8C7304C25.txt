Dear Principal ,

I am up for your new idea to have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities.

One reason is because if the students know they have to have a B average to participate in any school activities they're grades will go up and it'll be more honor students and no failures. They'll also want to keep they're grades up so they wont get kicked off the team because if its something they really enjoy doing why would they want to stop because of they're grades being bad.

Another reason is they'll focus more, by focusing more they'll know how and what to do on they're homework instead of not doing it because they don't understand so that means they'll pay attention more, which helps the teacher not get off task cause she knows someone isn't paying attention and I know the students who really pay attention would like that because they wont get distracted while they're trying to learn.

My last reason for this idea would be less getting in trouble, the more they know they'll get kicked off the team for the trouble they get in to and their grades,

so that means they'll stay out of the drama and trouble they see. And them staying out of trouble could lead them somewhere good in the future and I know the principal would enjoy not seeing kids in the office for getting in trouble.

Hence this , if the Principal did this the students grades will go up they'll focus more, and get in less trouble. I'm sure the teachers would love to have better grades and less distractions in class so it'll go through quicker.
