Dear Principal,

We have been hearing quite a lot about the subject of doing community service lately and my classmates have chosen me to write you this letter about what we think you should do and some reasons as to why you should. As we all know, community service is a lot of work, but it is also worth the work because we get a better town and community.

Community service is a very important matter in which I believe everyone should be involved. Whether it is cleaning a local park or helping other students, it is a very egregious activity for the community. It would also attract good attention to the school and promote other schools to do the same.

Community service is utterly important, not just to keep the town clean, but also to promote good habits and motivate students to help their neighborhoods or wherever they get in life. Some ideas for services include; trash pickup, school cleaning(bathrooms, trash, classrooms, etc.), and low cost field trips to places that are in dire need of cleaning.

If we did such services the school would get a good reputation and possibly more students, which leads to more funds, which leads to a better school. And if we got other schools involved in the movement we would have more help and a better community.

Just think, community service is a win for everyone. It keeps the community clean, the people happy, and the students learning good habits. They could make new friends, and we could have a more united, friendly, and most of all CLEAN setting for our future generations.

Thank you for your time and I strongly hope you consider this proposition.

Sincerely,

A student.
