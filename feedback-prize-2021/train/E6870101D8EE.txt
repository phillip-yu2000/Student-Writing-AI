Car usage in the United States has gone down by nine percent since 2005. But we are not the only ones who have limited ourselves to decrease air pollution. Large cities around the world like Paris and Vauban have insistuted car free days to help keep the air clean. Carpooling or even riding a bicycle has become more and more popular. People are no longer desiring to live in suburban areas, they want to be near the city. They are becoming more active and less stressed. Limited car usage has caused people venture away from their normal actvities and try new things.

Driving deprives you of the beauty of civilization. Weather it be that your missing the lights and crowded sidewalks full of random people in a huge city or small town full of trees and land marks, you are missin tout. You can not enjoy the air and sounds or all of the sights in your car through the windows. One Columbian ,Carlos Arturo, states that car free days are a good opportunity to take away stress. Taking a breahe of fresh air every now and again is exremely nessicary but we what will we do when we have polluted the air so much that there is no more fresh air left to take in?

Limited car usage would also encorage people to be more active. They would have to walk eberywhere they wanted to go. This would possibly decrease America's obesity rates.

"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city," is says in paragraph 28 of source three: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Having a healthy nation would help with so much more than anone could imagine.       Â
