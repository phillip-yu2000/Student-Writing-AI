Dear principle,

I am writing this letter the ask you to make community service a requirement for all students. I think it would really help our community. It would even help the students by teaching them things they cant learn in school. You can even give students extra credit for outstanding participation in community service.

Students would benefit from community service in many ways. One way I can think of is if a student works at a nursing home. Working their may teach them manners or respect for their elders. They may even hear some old stories from some of the seniors living there. Another way students could learn something is from cleaning up a park or beach. They can learn about our environment and learn how to clean up after themselves. They might even start recycling if they don't already. Some students may even help the school by maybe helping in the cafeteria or helping the janitor clean. Some of them may even help in the library or help a teacher with something. There are so many ways the students can help that I can't list all of them. I don't think there is enough paper on earth for me to do that.

In conclusion these are my reasons for supporting your idea for community service. It can help make our town, school, and lives much better. I think you have a very good idea and should follow through with it. Maybe our school or students will even win some kind of reward for our community service. Thank you for reading my letter. I hope you make the right choice and come to a decision soon.
