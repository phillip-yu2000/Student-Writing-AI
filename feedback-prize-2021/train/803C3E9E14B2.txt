I think everyone should be required to perform community service. they should support their community and keep it clean all the time like everyone else. It would be rude if they didn't help keep their community clean and safe all the time. If it was me I would love to help my community and country and keep it clean and safe for everyone to live in a clean and safe place. I think the principal should have everyone be required to perform community service everyday to keep the community safe and clean. If nobody kept it clean or safe people would be dead and die all the time. So yeah if I was the principal I would required everyone to help keep are community clean and safe all the time, and i would have everyone pick up trash off the grow everyday until are community in clean. And I would have everyone keep everyone safe everyday until they die. So yeah the principal should require the students to keep their community cklean and safe everyday.
