Every day you make decisions. Like, what you are going to wear, what you want to eat, and even who you talk to. Some decisions are easy to make while others can be harder to make. Sometimes you might need help setting your mind on something, so you ask someone what they would do or how they would make the decision. This is called advice.

The hardest decisions can mean the most and while making an important decision you may need to think for a long time. Asking people for their opinion on something can help comfort you and convince you to make a decision. But sometimes when you ask for advice someone could give you a whole new prespective on how you make your decision.

When being asked for advice about a topic you can be helpful in many ways. If you know a lot about the topic, you can make an educated guess on what you would do. If you know the person asking you could lean towards a decision you know would be better for them and help lead them in the right direction.

Sometimes asking just one person is not enough. Having several perspectives can help you lean towards a decision easier, because if most people agree with one way to make a decision it makes you more comforted to agree with them aswell. For example, you are picking what college you want to attend and are torn between two choices. You talk with an alumni of one of the schools and they said its the best school you could ever go to, you ask a group of people and most of them go with the same option because it will bring you better opportunity. You are now more convinced to choose that school because most people think it would be the best decision for you.

In your daily life keep track of how many times you ask for advice and how many times you are asked. Try always to make the best decisions and do what is best for you. Asking multiple people for advice can help make your day to day life easier by taking some of the weight of decisions off you.Â
