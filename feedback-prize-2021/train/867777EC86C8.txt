Dear Principal,

We should allow cell phones in school and be able to use them at free times and lunch periods but turned off during class time because if something were to happen to us during school when no teachers are around or any friends are around we would have no one to help us but if we had our cell phones with us we would be able to reach some one in a hurry . Also we should allow cell phones in school because during free time kids tend to do dumb stuff but if we had are cell phones we would have something to entertain us and not let us get in trouble .

Also if we had are cell phones in school it wouldn't do us or anyone else no harm . Cell phones are just for communication . This is why i feel that we should have cell phones in school. Also we wouldn't be able to cheat because our phones would have to be off during class time no matter what. Also we wouldn't get distracted from learning if our cell phones were off during class either . So please think about it and allow it and to go with Policy 1.

Sincerely,

Your Fellow Students
