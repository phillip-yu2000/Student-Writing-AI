Emotions are what you feel on a daily basis sometimes you can be happy and something you can be sad. In this passage "Making Mona Lisa Smile" students from the University of Illinois collaborated with Prof. Nicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. They developed better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can how how the student is feeling and it can help see if the student is enjoying what it is learning.

One facial expression can give it all away of how you are feeling. Facial Action Coding System can identify mixed emotions, each expression that is being made is compared to a neutal face that is not showing any emotional. If a student is having a bad day or something is wrong with them the software will instantly let them know how they are feeling. As in the painting "Mona Lisa" they were not sure what her emotions "she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry."

Another reason it is valuable is it can help see if a student is enjoying what it is doing. For example in the passage it says "A classroom computer coul recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." If that were to happen it would be able to modify the lesson such a effective human intructor.

The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Examples of why it is vaulable are while a student is working on a lesson the computer can find out how a student is feeling and seeing if a student is enjoying what he or she is learning.
