School Sport Policy

To whom it may concern:

The recent notice of changing the policy about students participating in sports must have a B average instead of a C average is a wonderful idea. This would cause student athletes to be more responsible, and think twice when it comes to stupid decisions.

First off, students that want to participate in a school sport would force them to get better grades to do something they love to do. Students would try harder in there classes versus the student athletes who get so-so grades and are missing assignments. Most student athletes do well in school anyway so they wouldn't get major affected by this change.

Secondly, this would make the student athletes think twice about making stupid decisions. for example it would most likely make the student do there homework every night. Also it would make some student athletes think twice about ditching school

Some people may argue that this new policy would put stress on student athletes, worrying about how they have to get good grades. That is what school is all about, pretty much if you do your homework every night, listen to instructions, and come to school every day, i guarantee you student athletes wouldn't have to worry about a thing.

In conclusion students with at least a B average will be able to play a sport versus a C average. This would make students think twice about some decisions. also it would teach student athletes about responsibility. If all student athletes did all what there supposed to do, they WILL play sports.
