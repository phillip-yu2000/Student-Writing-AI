Why do people talk to more than one person when they need advice? It is because the advice won't be biased, it gives a variety of advice, and at least one of those people will have good advice. If advice is needed, multiple people must be contacted for those reasons. It will benefit the person seeking advice heavily. There is no reason not to ask for advice from multiple people.

First off, advice won't be biased if multiple people are consulted. No one likes a biased opinion. If an opinion is only seen from one side, then advice will not be as helpful. This is why multiple people need to be contacted. Biased opinions aren't accepted anywhere else, so why should they be accepted when seeking advice.

Also, seeking opinions from multiple people will get a variety of advice to pick from. Varieties are always nice when it comes to advice. If theres no variety, then the limited choices given might not be any good. Bad advice is not going to take people anywhere. Always get a variety of opinions when advice is needed.

Lastly, the advice has to be helpful. That is why multiple people need to be spoken to, if any helpful advice is going to be obtained. If only one person is consulted, then they might not have very helpful advice. If multiple people are consulted, then one of them will have the right advice for the situation. Everyone needs good advice and seeking multiple opinions is the best way to get it.

That is why multiple opinions are needed for advice. The advice won't be biased, it gives a variety of advice, and it gets the best possible advice. It makes no sense not to consult multiple people for advice. It makes the situation a lot easier. Don't be stupid and seek advice from multiple people.
