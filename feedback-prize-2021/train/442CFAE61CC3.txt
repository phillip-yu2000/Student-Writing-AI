So we heard that our principal is going to let all the students to participate in one activity of their choice. But I have both reasons that might go alright or not. Lets just say if I agree or disagree with the principal decision and hopefully that our principal has a good feeling about this decision.

Lets start with a positive reasons. First responsibility, if the students get a activity that takes a lot of serious responsibility like for example serve on the student council or working on the yearbook, activity like that those have real responsibility to take care of. Next is not knowing it was the students talent, all activity will fill up very quickly and if any teacher puts a student that is not their favorite class they will notice that their very talented on a activity that they didn't like. Last positive reason overwhelmed, the student will get overwhelmed and sometimes is alright but at the end they still love the class.

Second, start with the negative reasons. It won't be their favorite if a student want to be a class so bad but then a teacher decides to put him/her to different class it's likely that the student wont be liking the class not a bit. Overwhelming, it's going to the same thing but the opposite its almost the same topic as the last reason of not liking the class and overwhelmed is the part cause of not liking the class which lead to our third last negative reason, dropping out its most likely that they gonna drop out the class it will get so stress and overwhelmed that the student decides to quit and that lead to have a no responsiblilty in life.

So I do agree with principal student or people need to have responsibility in life and without it theres going to be no job for that person who decided to drop of the activity they got asigned.
