Dear, Mr. Principal i have received notification that you are thinking of requiring community service to all students. I personally think that all students should be required to complete

216 hours (2 weeks) of community service over a time frame of 6months. This process i think will be beneficiary of teaching students responsibility, integrity, motivation, kindness, and honesty.

And hopefully will remove them of all selfishness, here is how I will go into depth about this process and how it might help. It is a possibility that particular items could be lost or dropped (food stamps, money, wallet, etc.) and if students can learn the importance of either help search for such items. If items where stolen this a way they can the importance of integrity, seeing as how items being returned can be rejected and asked to keep them for such integrity. Honesty also plays a roll in this for if there is an accident with the breaking of a dish or other valued items students can learn the importance of honesty and how people when given the benefit of the doubt can have understanding. Motivation can be shown after students complete tasks thru their community service, if they realize cleaning their room or doing household chores are necessary for being respectful to their parents and easing parental stress as well. Kindness in the sense of that if the help the elderly they might appreciate their youth and use in more productive
