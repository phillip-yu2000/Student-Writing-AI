Dear Principal

I believe that you should allow students to be able to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times. Yes you should allow the students to bring their cell phones and use them during free times because during free time students just talk and hangout. Some times talking in person is a bad thing, there for not talking face to face is a good thing. For example say I was mad at someone and if I would talk to them in person things would of gone bad, but if we used technology then things would be good again and would have not gone down a bad path. Cell phones are a good use of technology for everything and everyone should be allowed to use them. Yes if we students could be allow to use our cell phones on our free time and have them turned off during class, that would be fantastic! Students would be able to talk, record videos, take pictures and be able to remember everything and have great memories. Remembering memories is a good thing because we can look back and laugh, cry, and learn from our mistakes. Students are happy that we have technology yet most of the time we are not allow to use it. Technology helps everyone and everything become better. Cell phones help us communicate to people when we need help or just to talk have and have a good time. That's why I think you should allow students to use their technology during school on their free time. Rather than keep the No Cell phones Allowed rule. I hope you understand and agree with me and change the no cell phone rule to cell phones allowed.

Signed You Student,
