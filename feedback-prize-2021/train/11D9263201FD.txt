Dear State Senator,

Elections are up coming soon and before we all even know it, it's going to be election day. As we all know, there is this process called The Electoral College that was established in the Constitution by our founding fathers. To be honest, I think it is time for a change. If you really think about it, The Electoral College isn't really in favor of the people anymore. Here's what i think should happen, instead of on election day when we vote for just the President and just getting the senates that ran for the Presidental candidate, I think we should have two different votings: one for the President and one for the senates, here's why:

First, when election day comes around and we think we are voting for the president, we aren't, but instead voting for a big group of slate electors where

they

vote for the president. For example, if you lived in Washington and you wanted to vote for [John] Doe, for instance, you would be voting for a slate of about 35 electors pledged to that President. Then the slate of electors vote for the presdient, not the people, and I dont think everyone knows that. Most of the people that know about have said that The Electoral College is a "diaster factor" while the government says that "the American people should consider themselves lucky" WRONG!!!!!! The American people technically can't even vote for their own president becuase "it's against the Constitution" there needs to be a change. Like allowing some people who go in to vote to either: vote for a slate of electors who elect the President or just vote for the president themselves. That way the people feel like their vote actually does count.

Thank you State Senator for giving me some of your time so you can read my letter to you about The Electoral College. I hope you take my idea under consideration.

Thanks again,

Sincerely,
