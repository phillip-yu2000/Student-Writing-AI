Dear Senator

The electoral college is not a fair way for citizens to vote in the untied states. the popular vote system would work at so much more better for citizen. It would give them more of a say in the vote and more people would vote

First reason I think popular vote is better than electoral college is because it gives citizen more of a say in what goes on in the voting process. the reason for this if the popular vote was the system they used you will be voting on a actual president. not voting for someone to pick your president for you. so this clearly shows that voting using the popular voting syste gives people more of a say in the voting process. yes it might be unfair to smaller states who have less people but still.

Second reason i picked this thing was because well more people would vote. the reason more peole would vote is because they will feel theyhave more of a say in things. for instance if someone told you you can have more freedom or none you will pick freedom. so clearly this shows that more people would vote if they we used the popular vote system instead of the other one. yes the other one still lets you vote but not for a president

So in conclusion popular vote is way better than regular voting because you have more freedom anf you vote for a actual president
