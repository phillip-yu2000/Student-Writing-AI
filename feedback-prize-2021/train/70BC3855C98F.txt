In the article "Driveless Cars Are Coming" the author talks a lot about how driveless cars could be a good thing and a bad thing. My thoughts on driveless cars are negitive. My thoughts are only negitive because anything could go wrong.

One of my thoughts on driveless cars are what if you have to suddenly stop in an unknown place how whould the car know it has to stop. A driveless car could be or maybe would be the cause of most car accidents. Everyone wouldnt even know how to work it because we wernt born with it. It would maybe be a great technology but most people wouldnt be confortable doing or not doing something they havent did all their lifes.

Another one of my thoughts on driveless cars is when i think about a driveless car i think about all technology and there isnt a 100% chance that there wont be a malfunction. Most technology makes mistakes of has some type of glitch, so why would you put your life in the hands of a driveless car.

On earth, people are becoming lazier as the day goes by all the technology we have barely makes us want to move off of our couches. Which would also be another negitive thought about driveless cars.
