The author does a good job on suppoting why we shold visit Venus. but at the same time he gives some information that makes you think "why should we do this again."

In some parts of this article, for example paragraph 7, he gives really good reason and explanations to why we should investigate Venus. But in other parts like paragraph 3 it makes you think and wonder why they are reconsidering going to Venus. Yes going to Venus will give us a lot of information but at what cost. We would waste million, maybe even billion, of dollars trying to get to Venus and even if we did get to it what would happen to the first human to step out. What are the chances of that human making it back on the spaceship alive let alone trying to stay on the planet long enough to get some samples.

As much as scientist would study that planet and as sure as they could or could not be its all a theory. There is no sure way to nsure 100% that humans to go there will get back safely.

In conclusion to the question asked, I don't think the author supported the idea well. He did do a good job of giving us information but just from what he told us thats another reason why we shouldn't go to Venus.
