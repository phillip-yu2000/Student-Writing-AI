Have you ever had to make a super hard decision, and didn't know who to ask for advice from? Well, if you ever have to go through that, I highly recommend asking multiple people for their input. There are so many benefits of doing this including hearing different point of views, listening to people who have gone through similar situations, and seeing how the majority of people respond. If anything, asking multiple people for advice can only help you in the long run.

The first reason you should always ask multiple people for advice is hearing different point of views. You could ask 3 different people how they would handle your situation and they could all have completely opposite answers. Everyone has their own take and perspective on the problem. It's really important to listen to what everyone has to say so you can make the best choice based on all the advice you were given. Asking a group of people for advice, instead of just one, can really open your eyes on all the ways you can handle the conflict.

The next reason that you should ask more than one person for advice is being able to listen to people who have gone through similar situations. People in a group could have gone through similar problems and could tell you what they did and how the outcome turned out. It would be really great for you so that way you can avoid using strategies they used that didn't work out. You can also pick up on the good things they did to handle the problem and use them to your advantage. Overall listening to multiple people who have gone through the same thing can be extremely helpful.

Lastly, I think asking a group of people for advice would be great, so that way you can see how the majority of people respond. If most of the people in a group agree on one way of handling the issue, that probably means you should keep that in mind. A lot of the time, the majority of people can really impact your decision. Listening to what the majority of people say can be a really good tool for you to use when making a difficult choice. Overall listen to what others have to say, and it will really help you out!

It's really necessary to listen to other's opinions when making a tough decision. It's also really beneficial to hear multiple people's thoughts. The benefits of that are hearing different of point of views, listening to people who have gone through similar conflicts, and seeing how the majority of people respond to your issue. So the next time you need to make a difficult decision, don't forget to ask more than one person for advice.
