Dear principal,

Hearing that you are changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports and other activity because we have a C average is upsetting. A high average of the children may have a C average but its not fair for those who actually have an A average. I'll agree that it is a smart idea to change the policy so that students will do better but its unfair for others. Sports ties into physical activity and children need that, what sense would it make to not let kids participate in that?

Physical activity is important to children, and they enjoy it too! Its a stated fact that people should get at least 60 minuets of exercise per day. Also, as for other activities like school trips... as a word of advice some field trips are educational, and sometimes teachers give us assignments based on those trips. As for the other students that are marvelous this would be really unfair to them. Personally, if I was an A average student and I wasn't allowed to participate in and sports and other activities I'd be really upset and disappointed

As a normal student who goes to school every single day and keeps on learning (not like learning isn't fun) I strongly believe that you should let us participate in sports and other activities because those are the only times in school when we're not reading and writing. It gives us a break, and you may not notice -but that is really what us children need. Not saying that this was a bad idea to think of, but if you change the school policy and don't let children participate in sports and physical activity it wouldn't really motivate them to improve their averages.

If you really think that changing the school policy and letting students not participate in sports or other activities... you should really take this letter into consideration.

Sincerely,
