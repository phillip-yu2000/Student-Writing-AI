I feel as though, students should be able to have cell phones at school. Of course, we should turn our phones off in class, but as far as our free time, we should be allowed to have them. When we get our cell phones taken away at school and then we have to pay to get it back, that's so kinky to me. Its Like, Where do i money go?

Students would probably do better knowing that they can have their cell phones out, instead of sneaking them out. When we see our teachers texting or accepting calls in class, that's makes us want to do the same. We understand their adults, but the teacher can interrupt our education, just as well as we would if we had our phones. So, why cant we have our phones out again?

This is my last year in Middle School and from what i hear about at the High School, were allowed to take calls outside of class and use our phones. I just don't see the difference from Middle School and High School. This may sound crazy, but i seriously think students would do so much better in school, if we could have the privilege to have our cell phones out.

The way there making cell phones now an days, we can actually do homework on our phones. I've actually typed a Rela report on my Blackberry, emailed it to myself, printed it, and turned the paper in.

So, phones aren't all about social networking, we can actually do school related activities on there as well.

Well, I hope whoever's reading this can take this in consideration and understand where I'm coming from. I know administrators might think its a bad idea, but just try it and see how it goes. If students cant focus in school and their more interested in their cell phone, then take away the privilege away from them. I really hope you guys would be able to put this in infect, i think it would be great!
