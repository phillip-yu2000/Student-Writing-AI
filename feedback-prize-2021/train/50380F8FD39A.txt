"The Face on Mars" Could not be an alien creation becuase, it most likely would be more high tech because "Aliens" are lightyears ahead of our technology.

Also NASA said it was just a huge rock formation that was formed by shadows to create "The Face on Mars." Also Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a really good picture which first appeared on a JPL website that was confirmed that the face was not an Alien monument. Also if aliens were to create this "Face" why didnt people in space see them do it. The Mars Global Surveyor's took at picture at maxium pixel to show that this "momument" was accually a little bigger then a buttle or a mesa.

"The Face on Mars" is not an alien monument reason being they confirmed ot was in fact a rock formation that had shadows make it look like a face.
