I go with policy 1. of course i want a phone in school that what we are all about texting and talking to our friends. cell phones is a good way to spend your free time in school we work hard enough to get something that we deserve for our free time cell phones in the hallway before class is great that's my opinion many students use them for math and reading i used my phone in school before, but not to text just so i could do my work in school we don't just use our phone to text or call but to do our work. there are so many ways we could use our cell phones in projects and maybe learn more about technology that include our phones how do it work and how that know to push a button and it goes where you want it to go like the contact and a tools like an caulator it has everything a caulator has i want to learn about cell pnones is there only one chip that do all the work or is there alot of wires that can control the phone i don't know that's what i want to learn about. cell phones can do good like our principal they use cell phones so they can get information to another principal or a teacher that need to know something important. that's why i so with policy one because phones can teach you things you might not know. we are in school for 8 or more hours it gets boring and you want to do something for your free time for 8 hours of work.
