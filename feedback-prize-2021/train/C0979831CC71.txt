Dear principal,

imagine a school that pays more attention in light then in education .Well some schools are starting to reconsidering the cell phones policy. I think that student are better off without cell phones in school at all because many student loose focus in learning the materials because they are more busy texting in classes. Another reason why school shouldn't allow the cell phones in school is many students leave their phones in their lockers and people steal them .

Many studies have shown that almost every student in the schools have cell phones and they concentrate more in texting in school rather learn their materials .Students are lacking in learning abilities by texting in classes and lose their focus and cause them to fail classes or passing the classes that are required to pass. Student are getting in trouble during classes by getting a consequence for being caught with a phone and cause them to lose a day of learning. In libraries that are suppose to help by a quiet environment so people can finish their homework or do something in a computer it's being abused by students .Using cell phones and texting disturbing other people concentration.

When cell phones are brought to school their are possibilities that it might be stolen by somebody .Student that leave their cell phones in their locker usually accuse others that they stole them and that bring arguments with students and teachers. False accusation can lead to many unwanted fight with a phone problem. Student take many chances to bring their phones to the school and the school doesn't want to be responsible that why we shouldn't bring cell phones to school to bring commotion to the school.

Schools shouldn't allow students bring cell phones to school because one little object can lead to many trouble and its suppose to help us and is hurting or way to think in school .
