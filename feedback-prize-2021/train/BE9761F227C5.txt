The face on mars. The space craft Viking snapped a photo of what look a human face on mars. The face is two miles long from end to end. Many conspiracy theorists think that the face is alien made. The face is not alien made though.

The theorists wanted to know proof that it wasn't alien made. So April 5,1998 the Global Surveyor flew over the face and took a picture ten times shaper than the first picture. Thus you could see that the face was formed not by aliens but by natrual formation.

The theorists where still not happy about the photo take. On the that day mars had a dust strom that day so the picture kinda had a haze to it. So the mission controllers had to prepare to take another picture. So they did and on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day on mars the picture was took.

Once agian the picture showed that there were no alien houses or monuments. The picture was taken with absolute maximum resolition. So you could see every little detail on mars. Scientists concluded that the formation was made by lava coming to the surface and making a formation that just happend to look like a face mage by aliens.
