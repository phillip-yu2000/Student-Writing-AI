DEAR, TEACHER_NAME

I Think what you're doing is an excellent idea. The reason why I say this is because if students like sports so much they can be able to get an B or A average. In these days if you tell a student that they wont be able to participate in sports or other activities they will try there hardest to succeed and get An A average. If a kid has an f or c for his 3rd quarter and you don't put him on the rite road that kid will keep failing unless someone teaches that kid responsibility and discipline. what im saying is you have to be hard on a student at all times so that way that student will be on point and making sure hes doing the rite thing.

I don't blame you for 1 bit because I understand that you are trying to prepare us for the real world and that so we can be the best at whatever we do whether its basketball or baseball , drawing or being the head of your class. I think changing the school policy is an elevated idea.
