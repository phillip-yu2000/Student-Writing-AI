The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, I feel this way because it can help on so many ways. In the text kids would ask if this machine really worked, like tthey were intrested in knowing what it was. The computer can help with teachers because if the students are feeling down or something is wrong with them, the system can see whats going on and what type of mood their in so you can try and make them feel better. It also says that the facal expressions are universal, and that using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks the facial movements. Thats another way why I feel like this system is helpful to students in a classroom. This system can go so far with so many different things dealing with all types of emotions including mixed emotions. It also goves you examples on how a computer will know if your sad or not, and alot of students in a classroom would find that satisfying. One example to that is saying if you smile whena web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad as the first one might follow. But if you frown, the next ad while appear to be different on your screen. I find that so amazing, that theres so many ways in the electronic community just to come up with new out of the world things, and this is one of them. For that, I feel like yes this system is valuable to students in a classroom. But not just one classroom of students, but students from all over the worls. I feel like they would love it and how it works. Not alot of children have the opportunity to try out systems like these, so if they had the chance I think they would take the opportunity in showing that this system is good for everyone. It doesn't even just have to be students , it can also be adults too! I feel like they would also love the system.
