I think people that want to make a difference should particepate in the sea cowboys. Before I joined the seacowboys I kust finished high school and I was working two jobs. I was working at a grocery store and a bank. When my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe with him on a cattle boat I couldn't say no. I knew it was an opportunity of a life time!

What we were doing was for the countries that were left in ruins we have to give them livestock so that they don't die of starvation. On the two month jouney I turned 18 before reaching Greece. That meant that I could drafted for the military service, but when they found out I was on a cattle boat they said to keep doing what I was doing for my service. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I had made 9 trips (more than anyother seagoing cowboy). That is what I did for two years.

If you are thinking about joining the seagoing cowboys I highly recomend it. The seagoin g cowboys need strong ,smart and people that are willing to go away from family for a while to help other people. We are leaving this year on july 5,2016. Bring things that you know you will need. Try to only bring the nesecities.
