As a student, I can say there are a lot benefits for a student from being able to attend classes from home, is really convenience for a student that some schools offer distance learning as an option, every school should have that opportunity; it ca be helpful for a lot of students, is good for students that does not have a lot of time, so that help them to have a flexible manage of time, in some cases the student are more successful by taking the classes online.

For example if some students have to work , and because their work's schedule take them a lot of time or they have to work at night, they do not feel like waking up earlier in the morning, sometimes they start to getting late to classes, missing classes or missing all days of school, but if the student try to taking classes online can be really helpful for them; since they can have their schedule at their convenient, the opportunity or the facility of making up their on schedule according to their others activities.

Also when someone have to travel a lot for some reason, taking the classes online they do not have stay in the same place every time they are taking the classes, it dose not matter, they can take it anywhere they want, the only two things they need is a computer, and also to have internet connection, and thats it, they should be good with those two things or some people do not have that facility of moving of one place to other, they do not have the money to defray cost for the transportation, or is just to far away from their houses, so the classes online are a way to fix that problem.

There is a large percentage that the students that are taking or took classes online are or were going great, their are doing a successful work, they are being tempting to show more attention to their classes, a lot people say that they feel the classes easier, and also that is easier to study,

when the classes have videos they can put back the video over and over, when ever they want, how many times they want, where ever they want,if they want the teacher to do not talk fast or to do it they can regulate that also, they save a lot of money, because they do not have to spend a lot of money in materials, like for posters and things like that, they do not have to be with some people that distract them from the classes and is also faster to get the classes done.

So how is showed the opportunity that some schools bring them is wonderful, it have a lot of benefits for us, like some students are more successful taking the classes online, so much students are interested in the classes online, feel like is better for them so that way they can be taking classes and doing other things, they just have learn how to manage their time; people that work can do their classes at morning and go work at night, they can have a flexible schedule.
