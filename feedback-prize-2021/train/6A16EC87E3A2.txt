Dear state senator I think that you should keep the Electoral Collage because it is a collage that requires a presidential canidate to have a trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recivies a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College is a method of choosing the president of the United States and that is really importnt that we have a president. The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College because it's in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral Collage is very important to the United States we should keep the collage. In some cases people depend on the Electoral collage they chose who will be President and like state goveners that is very impornant that the founding fathers made the Electoral Collage. In 1976,Â  tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had votes he other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.
