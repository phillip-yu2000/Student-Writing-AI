Im going to be talking about driverless cars and my oppinion or position on them, I think they are a great idea, they keep people safe and notifies when they need human skill required.

Driverless cars keep you safer than if a human was driving, human error can make the difference between life and death when it comes to driving, if there is a car that doesnt need to be driven by humans, we need to fund it for safety and the advamcement of our society. Driverless cas are also safe for when they have problems that the car's computer cant handle then it notifies the driver when it does want human skill, eventually we will have cars that will need no human skill and fatal car crashes will not happen as often. If the car can drive itself and not crash nearly as often as humans do then what if everyone had one, will there be no more fatal car crashes or even crashes, will crime rates go down because the car will most likely have a sensor that is related to the owner of the vehicle so they cant get away from the police or car owner.

In a perfect world there will be no more car crashes of any sort, yes there will be the occasional fender bender, but with no more death because of fatal car crashes and saftey will rise and crime rates will go down, these are all what if's, but if these were to come true the whole world will change completly.
