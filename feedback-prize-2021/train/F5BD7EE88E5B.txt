Using this new form of technology called the Facial Action Coding System ,which is being used to identify human emotions, could be a good contibution to society. But,

in my opinion technology that is used to read our emotional expressions would not be that valuable because there are not a lot of things we could use it for and we are capable of expressing ans sensing our feelings on our own.

If we were going to start using this technology, what exactly would we use it for?

There are not many actual reasons that we would need it. In the article they bring up how this technology could be used to tell if a politician or celebrity was lying or telling the truth. Which could be important because we would not want to be supporting someone who lies to everyone to get them to be on their side about something. Other than that this technolgy does not actually hold a lot of value.

Also, I do not think that we need technology to help tell us how we feel. We are all capable of knowing how we feel. If something makes us happy then we will smile and if something made us sad then we might cry. So, having something to tell us how we feel is kind of a waste of time and money which could be used on more important things that we need as a society.

In conclusion, this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System used to identify our human emotion does not hold any value. It may have a good contribution to some people who are not able to sense or express their feelings. But I do not think it is important enough to be used on a daily basis for certain people.
