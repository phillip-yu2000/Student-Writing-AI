Mr. Principal,

I would like to let you know how I, and many others feel about volunteering and community service.

I believe it should not be required but should be kept as a free choice.

I feel volunteer work as a required task would give it less value because of the reason behind the good work.

I believe community service does benefit the community and many people in different ways.

Some people need their time for school work and for their own daily lives and volunteer work may disrupt their schedules and routines.

Some people have a hard time with other activities, and volunteering for other service activities limits time for their own commitments.

I believe the best solution to let students experience community service, is to always have the options open.

Also, the school can bring volunteering and community service into its student programs such as with fundraisers.

This way,

I believe students can receive a combination of a good school, life, and service experience.
