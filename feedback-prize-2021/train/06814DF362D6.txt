Have you ever wanted to do something for your school, but didn't know what? This would be the perfect chance for you. I agree that students should participate in one school activity because it's a good way to make new friends, it allows students to step out of their comfort zone, and it's a good way for students to do something for their school.

First, this is an excellent way for students to make friends. Some students struggle making friends, this would allow them to find someone with the same interests as them. They get to communicate with students they have never met before. Making students participate in one of the activities may help them find a long term friend. plus, this will help them be able to make friends with anyone and they won't have to struggle anymore.

Secondly, this allows students to step out of their comfort zone. Students will have the opportunity to express themselves with the other people in that certain activity. Maybe a student had a great idea, this might be the chance to share it with others. Some students struggle with stepping out of their comfort zone. Maybe one of these activities will help them with that.

Lastly, this is an excellent way in participating in your schools everyday. The students that enjoy sports can join the football team, or even the baseball team. For those students who like art can join the yearbook staff. Let's not forget those who enjoy school spirit, they can join the students council. These are all great ways to be involved with your school.

It's a good way to make new friends, it allow students to step out of their comfort zone, and it's a good way to be involved in your school. These are the reasons why I believe this is a good idea for students. Don't forget that these aren't the only options. There are many more!!
