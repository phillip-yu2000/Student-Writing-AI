In this artical the author discribes how computers are able to reconize human emtions. In my opinion I think that using tecnology that read peoples emotions in classrooms is invaluable becasue it takes away your privetsey away. I think that because in the aritical it show that the teacher can tell if you are unmotivated or bored and the teacher can change the way that the assinment is worded to make it more interesting.

So if that ever happed I bet someone would just put tapeor some other object to cover the camera so the it can not tell what the peron is doing. Their is always a way to stop some thing on the internet. Also in the artical it tell us that we are going to able to communicate with our computers and I think that that is very wierd, and if we did that I would take away our communication skill with other people even more than it is now.

Having that tecnology would be benifical in other thing instead of a classroom like for the police for interigating other people, in court to see if other people are lying. So the tecnology does have some benifits but I disagree it being used in a classroom for the teacher to see what you are doing. That is the reason that I disagree with having tecnology that reads human emotions in classrooms.
