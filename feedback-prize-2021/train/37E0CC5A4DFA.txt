Driverless cars are not in the best interest for humans. People like to be in control. Men and women won't want to give up their freedom of driving their own vehicles. The feeling of being proud to drive yourself around will over power the easiness of having a car, just drive you.

Driverless cars are not even close to being ready, some can only go up to 25 mph. With highways and freeways a 25 mph car serves no purpose. The article states, "... but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. If you have to hold on to the wheel, then you might as well drive yourself.

Now, with the popularity of driverless cars growning, some states have outloud the driverless cars. "In most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars." Being able to drive from state to state is a great privilage in the United States. Having a driverless car would only be good for a state that aloud it. Vacations across the Us would become much more difficult, if you weren't even aloud to "drive" your own car.

Finally, Computers have been gettign hacked sense the first one was invented. A hacker hacks it, the computer malfunctions and all files are erased or it acts on terms that you can not control. Driverless vechicles run on a computer based system. It only takes one terrorist or criminal to figure out how to hack it and crashes could occur within a push of a button. But, these cars could be useful to get a good nap in, or rest so someone isn't tired and driving. They could also help out with drunk driving. The only problem is, that there are to many difficulties that come with these new products and they will never be in the peoples good interest if they are not solved.

Driverless cars are the things of the FUTURE. Right now in present time they are to difficult to make, and dangers within their processing are not correctly set up. Driverless cars would cause a negative impact in our society.
