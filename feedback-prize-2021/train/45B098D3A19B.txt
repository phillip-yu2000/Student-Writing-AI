We all know how important safety is and I personality believe that people should not operate any type of vehicle while using your cell phone.

There has been plenty of accidents caused by texting and driving as well as being on your phone while operating a machine at work. It is always important to keep in mind the safety of others as well as your own. Driving while texting is a major cause of fatal accidents leading up to death.

Its always good to make sure that your very careful when driving and to look all directions while driving so you don't hit anyone and so you don't get hit as well. NOTHING is more important then your life or anyone's life. There for I believe that drivers should not operate any type of vehicle while being on their phones.

Texting while driving could not only take someone's life but it can also get you into trouble with the law. Lot of states have made it illegal to be on your phone while driving. For example in the state of Georgia cell phones are prohibited. The consequences of using your phone while driving would be a fine of 50 dollars as well a 1 point assessed against the drivers license.

Other reasons why being on the phone while driving is bad is because it is distracting and there is a high risk of car crashes.

There is also a high chance to be at fault for an accident if there was ever one to occur.

These are all reasons why I believe drivers shouldn't be allowed to use their cell phones while using or operating a vehicle.
