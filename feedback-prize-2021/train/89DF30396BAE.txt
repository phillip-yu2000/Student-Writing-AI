Dear Principle,

It would be make out community better if the principle would make everyone do community service. People should be required to do it because it would make our environment cleaner. Also people would take more respect in our community.

People would have a responsibility to clean up after themselves and others.

Our environment would be so much cleaner if everyone would help clean it. Most people don't think about our community before they do something wrong to it. It needs to be kept clean and not have trash everywhere. Since they are the people to clean it they wouldn't destroy our community. Also many people grafiti on things. Things are ruined from spray paint and markings all over walls or buildings. People need to clean our environment so it can last longer and be much cleaner for us all.

People in our community should have more respect for it. Many things are just getting done and no one is having respect to the people that actually go out there and clean it all up and try. If more people would try to not litter and do other things to our community than it wouldn't be half as bad as it is. People don't know what it is doing to our environment. So that they do know about it more they should be out there cleaning it and seeing how unclean our community is.

People would have a responsibility to clean up after themselves and others. Most people don't have to do chores at home. This would give them a way to learn how and maybe start to help around the house more. This could teach them in the future to take care of your environment and teach their kids about it. If they learn now than they will know not to do something bad to the environment. They can also teach their friends more about cleaning and not littering.
