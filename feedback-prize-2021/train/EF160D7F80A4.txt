Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Cell phones have always been a big conflict when it comes to school policies.

Many schools have a no phone policy. Other schools only allow cell phones during free times, such as lunch or between classes. I believe that students should be allowed to use cell phones at school during free periods. They provide valid communication, allow students to have more freedom, and shows that the principle has respect for her students.

Cell phones at school provide a way of communicating with other students. Say that OTHER_NAME was trying to find his best friend RELATIVE_NAME at school. Well, all OTHER_NAME would have to do is send RELATIVE_NAME a text asking him where he was. Then, RELATIVE_NAME could simply reply that he was out by the fountain at the front of the school, so OTHER_NAME could meet him there. Another scenario where your cell phone could be used at school, is if one of your friends is at home, sick, that way you could text them their assignments after each period. These are just a few ways that cell phones can be used for communication at school.

Freedom is a huge concern with middle and high school students. Allowing them to have their phone at free times gives them the perfect amount of freedom. It's just enough to please them, but not too much, so that it'll get them in trouble. Who knows? After a while the students could get tired of using their phones at school. At lest try to provide the students with freedom, and if that doesn't work the policy can be changed.

Almost everyone in the whole world wants respect. Especially teenagers struggling with a identity. Allowing the students to have their cell phones shows them that you have a certain respect for them. They'll be grateful that you allow them to have their phones. They will even start respecting you more if you have a respect for them. So, show your students respect and allow them to use their cell phones. I can guarantee that they'll return that respect.

Sincerely,
