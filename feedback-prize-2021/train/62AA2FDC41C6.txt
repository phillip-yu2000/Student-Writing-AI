I believe that policy 1 is better because it would allow the students to have their phones out during free time. It gives them a chance to calm down after a long test. It would help them if they needed to contact a parent. It would give them a chance to text a friend so they would not do it in class. It would allow them to be more focused if they did not have to worry about texting. If they could get their texting done at school they might not go to sleep in class.

If they did their texting during their free time they would not go to sleep during class. They would work hard to get their free time so their grades would get better. If the teachers allowed them to text they would have fun in class and listen to the teachers and be more friendly to them. If the whole country did this there would be an increase in the good grades all over the country

I believe that if we did this the students would be happy and their grades would be better and they would go on to college. It would be a smart choice for the school to allow them to text during free time. If they could text in school they would have more time at home to study or read or do home work. And if a student was caught texting in class the phone should be taken up and the parent of the child should have to come get it.

That is why i like policy 1 because it allows the students to have a little fun before going back to work. This way kids do not have to worry about getting their phone taken away if they get caught in lunch with it.
