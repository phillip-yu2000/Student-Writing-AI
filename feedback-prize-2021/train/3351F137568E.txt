Your opinion could mean a lot to someone. Why do you think seeking multiple people for opinions helps you make a better choice ? Getting more than one opinion is good because someone could have probably had the same choice you had to make in life , or maybe one person could know a lot about what you are going threw.

Dont you think people are going or have been threw your problem to ? There are definitely people with the same problem as you or people that could have been threw the same problem as you but know a lot about it thats why you should always ask more than one person for their opinions about a choice that you are going to make. if you were to just ask one person about a choice you are going to make without other people knowing what choice you are going to choose it could either turn out bad.

I remember when my friend was thinking about which NBA player to get in 2k20. He had the option of a 99 overall Kobe Bryant , or 99 overall Micheal Jordan. So then we started discussing it with another friend that I called about and then we all brought up ideas on how one was better than the other and then we came to a decision , we all thought that Micheal would be better so we told him to get him and he did. At the end it was a good choice.

Thats why should always ask more than one person about a choice you are going to make. Asking more people could make you change your mind on one of the choices you have already chosen. The amount of people you talk to about your choice could have a big impact on which one you choose. If your friend had to make a decision wouldnt you wanna be there to help him/her with it ?
