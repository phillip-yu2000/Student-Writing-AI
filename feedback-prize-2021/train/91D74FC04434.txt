Dear Senator

I belive america should keep the electoral college because the choice of the prople is not always the best, also that is how the founding fathers wrote it. I dont know who came up with the idea to get rid of it and why also how that would help us americans but i think that it would not be a very good change.

First of all the opion of the public is not always good some choose some presidents because of there race, gender, the amount of money they have but the should really be choosing on how the person is in reality. what the T.V. shows is not always true and not always nice. Some people dont even go online to do research they choose this person because of what they do "oh. he gave low-income people some of is money and time. he is the right president". When actually that was the guys first time and may only do that to get the public to like him. There are some presidents who really go out there and do help but it is not often published. While the electorial college does not vote off of color or race or gender but of where this guy has been, what college hewent to, how offten he works and at what job. They do a total background history of this guy and find out if he is president material.

Next this founding father compromise goes back very far. I dont know to much about the founding fathers or the constitution. I did not pay attention as much as I should have but I know that what they wrote the wrote for the best result. They wanted the best for america and its people. So far the rules the wrote and things they have done for us those many years ago have never harmed us. I belive that there is grateness in the electoral college.

In conclusion I belive the electorial college shoul stay because regular citicens are not resarchingÂ  and caring about who runs america. The founding fathers made the right decision choosing the electorial college.
