Do you want to help other people in other countries? If so, come join the UNRRA now!

There are many reasons to join the UNRRA. You get to help other people by giving them what they need to survive. You can by giving them food, clothing, and shelter. When you help other people with their needs, you get to go to other countries that you might have only heard about or not even heard of at all. When you bring people what the need to survive, you can see the joy on their faces. Seeing joy in others is a warm and inviting feeling. You can go sightseeing and go visiting very, very important places. I have been to many important places and landmarks, and so can you if you join. If you have dreamed about crossing oceans and helping others, then this is a job for you.

When the feeling of boredom strikes you if you have been on the boat for a long time, you have the chance to get to know your shipmates better and make friends. There also may be games to play on board like baseball and volleyball in empty stalls where the animals once were. There is table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling; which is carving things into blocks of wood and various other games. If you love taking care of animals, then you might be good at this job. There are many other jobs on board the ship. There is the opportunity to learn about your shipmates, learn what other countries and other people need, and there is also the opportunity to mature.

All of these things I have learned or done while on this job and trip around the world helping others. This is your chance to join the UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) or become a "Seagoing Cowboy" today. We need you now!
