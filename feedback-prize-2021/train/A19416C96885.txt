Dear principal,

I am writing to argue against requiring at least a B average. I believe changing the requirements to play sports or any other extra curricular activities is outrageous. If students have a C average, which is a passing grade, they should be able to participate. Many students at our school have a grade C average, if you take away sports it could possibly drive them away from even coming to school. Now what good would that do? Raise and teach the world's children to throw away our education's and start working dead end jobs. Well I know I don't want to, so this is me arguing for us, the children's sake.

I know how tough this decision must be, but that is because you're making it challenging. Sports and other activities is what our country run's on. That is what gives us fuel, makes us want to learn more and better ourselves. The purpose in life is to make the best of it, to do what we love. That is what us children are trying to do. Make a better world for the children to come. So consider thinking about what your decision can do to us and all of the people to come. If your decision has the power to do all of that, then imagine the power you'll be putting into us by allowing us to do what we love even if we have a grade C average(it is a passing grade). At least we're trying and that let's you know we all care.

sincerily your student,
