Dear Senator,

The president of the United States of America should be chosen by popular vote rather than the Electoral College because is allows citizens of the U.S. to have more power. The Electoral College takes away some opinions of the states which is unfair; we as citizens should have all the say in who we want leading us. I'm not alone, either; "Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO want to abolish the electoral college" [

Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer]. People don't get enough power with the Electoral College; Al Gore lost the presidency thanks to the electoral college but he had won the popular vote. So we should let someone else have all the power? I don't think so; we deserve better than this and over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. There are about 538 electors in the Electoral College and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a President [

by the Office of the Federal Register] but there are millions of American voters. Also the text [

What is the Electoral College?

] states that when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Americans aren't even voting for president anymore, just the electors?! That is completely unfair to the country. The Electoral College does have its perks, though. It helps with a certainty of outcome and it helps avoid run-off elections [

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner]. The United States is supposed to be the land of the free; we're supposed to thrive off of our independence and therefore we should abolish the Electoral College process and give the power to the people. We deserve a say, not what others suggest.

Best Regards,
