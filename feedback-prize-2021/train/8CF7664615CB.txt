My opinion is that the electoral college should be abolished.  In source two paragraph eleven Bradford gives a interesting statement to leave the reader thinking why.  "The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor", mentions the article.  I think what she is trying to say is that the system is prepared for chaos and that is what might happen in the future if things do not change.

The electoral college system can at many times be irrational.  In source two paragraph thirteen the author puts out a bold and straight forward opinion.  "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters", mentions Bradford.  The author is trying to say that our popular vote created by the people is no longer cared for when electing our president, it is all up to the electoral college.

What do you think about the electoral college?  In source three paragraph fifteen Richard A. Posner gives a very well put together decription of what we call the electoral college.  "The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner." The electors are who is actually electing the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential canidate you are really voting or a slate of electors instead.

Overall the electoral college is an unfair, outdated, and irrational system.  Do you really think your vote counts?  They are lying to you, because it does not. They are who decides our president.
