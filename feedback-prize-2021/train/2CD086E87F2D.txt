In my opinion, the Facial Action Coding System is only telling what the faces are expressing not how the person is feeling. A person can be making one face but, can be feeling different. This technology couldn't be valuable to students in a classroom. The author states that Dr. Huang predicts, " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." and then goes on to talk about how the computer would modify the lessons for the student. The computer could suggest the student is feeling one emotion but the student could really be feeling another. A student could be mad and irritated but the computer could suggest it is confused by the facial expressions the student is showing. A student could look tired but, could be feeling happy and the computer could suggest that the student is sad and miserable when in reality the student is just tired.

The article also states that Dr. Paul Eckman is using six basic emotions; happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. There are many more emotions that just these six, so when the computer is trying to calculate a facial expression it could be way off from how the student is really feeling since it is only using six basic emotions.

In my opinion, no, The Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable for students in a classroom. The system has only six basic emotions, which a student could be feeling none of. People don't know what another person is feeling by only looking at their facial expression. I don't agree that The Facial Action Coding System could know what a person is feeling just by seeing a facial expression especially if a human can't and I don't believe this system could be of any valuable use for a student in a classroom.
