This new technology is going to be very valuable. As in paragraph 6 the auther tells of when kids are in a class that are not understanding or comperhending the material. The computer can tell the teacher if the student is having a difficult time understanding. The teacher inturn can give help to the student as its needed.

As this day and age of the technology countines the teachers are not going to be able to realie on the students to ask questions. This is where the program will come into play. For the students that keep trying the questons and dont ask questions or the students that just sit there and are mad about something and there not working. The teacher can look on there computer and realize etheir they dont know what there doing or if their getting mad from keep trying the problems and not getting them correct. So in this case they can hopefully stop the issue before it gets out of hand or give the student help when nessacary. When you look at your freind or teacher that you now there facial experestions. You can often tell if something is wrong. This new program will take this idea that we use and turn it into a way for teachers to help students in the class room setting. There is also no way to cheat this program as it takes a 3-D model of your facial muscles and with this said. There's a sertain type of look you give when you nervous so the teacher can ask whats wrong.

This is a great program for the teachers all around. For them to be able to tell if you need help without asking. And not have to worry about people not understanding and leaving the class not comperhanded anything. Your lab parter may understand alot but you understand a little so in this case the teacher can ask your lab partner to tell you what is happing.
