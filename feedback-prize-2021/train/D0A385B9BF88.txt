I dont really know what my choice is, like i know alot of poeple like to drive an control thereown car. But i dont understand how alot safer an more controlled it would be it would be cool if you just had a gps an typed in where your going an the car drives stops turns and does all that by itself. But also you gotta know if all the people in world had that type of car you dont know if its running on electrecity or solar power or wind power. If it used on elecrtecity bam you already know there is gonna be so much power outtages and balls of spark going everywhere cause literally we drive by phone pole and electecity boxes everyday dnt you think if one of those things blew it wouldnt be like a cercuit. im just saying ya it would be coo just to fall asleep in yo car if your going somewhere really far an just have your car drive. But it is also risky cause what if they just made em that year or what ever year an they only tested a couple million do you know how may people are in the world ya theres alot more than a couple million, what im trying to say is what if it does its own thing diesnt stop or doesnt turn your either gonna get yourself killed or someone else killed. that is all i have to say about these new driverless cars they sound cool but reality is it worth it?
