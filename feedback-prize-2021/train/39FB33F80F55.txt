I think that this new software, the Facial Action Coding System is good idea and a really great system. Because me myself I have friends that will say there fine when I really know there and it and it would be really nice to have this just so your really knew how there are feeling. And I think its super smart that the system uses the 44 major muscles. One thing that I don't like about the system is that someone could use it on me and then someone. Like my mom could and would be able to tell when I'm not ok or when im upset. But I guess if I wanted this to use on my frinds then there is a down fall. And that would be the software could get into my moms hands, But hey you lose some and you win some. Over all I like it and wouldnt mind have it.
