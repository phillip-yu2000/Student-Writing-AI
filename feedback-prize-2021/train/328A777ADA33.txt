Dear principal,

All student should get to do sport and other actives if they have a good grade or a bad grade. But if they have a bad grade then the school should help them with the grades but not kick them out of the actives. The child should have warnings and be helped by the school. If a child is missing field trips, class experiments, and other things then he would be losing the enjoyment of the activity. If there was like a system could be set up that would take kids in at lunch and school breaks and help the child learn on the subject that are have a bad grade in.

If the children are getting no help from the teachers then you should be a after school program that the kids have to take if they have bad grades. Not take away activities. Children should force them selves to do work or get there parents to work on homework with them and help them learn after school. The parents should set up a system so they can do learn on the subject that is doing bad.

If most of the school have a grade c average then most of the school is not going to get on the field trips and stuff. If kids have field trips they can learn about stuff and bond with the teachers. For example if a field trip was going to the museum there kids can learn a lot about the artifacts there and how stuff came to be. What if a field trip was going to DC. The kids could learn about how the country came to be, where it all happened, and how it all happened. By these activities kids need them more. This is why I think child should not be limited on the grade average.
