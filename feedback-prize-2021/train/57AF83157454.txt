My years a Seagoing Cowboy was a great time. Not only did I do it with one of my best friends, I got to experince something that comes once in a life time. Also, I had many different experinces out of the United States. Finally, I was kept from going to serve in the military. I for one was a little excited about that.

Like I said, for a small town boy like me, sailing around the world is an opprotunity of a life time. There was no way I was going to turn down something like that. On my first trip I turned 18 years old and as you probably know, I would have had to join the military. But, they made an exeption due to the fact that I was already involved with the Seagoing Cowboys. Again, there was know way I would take serving in the military over sailing around the world. Another reason why I think that anyone should tryout the Seagoing Cowboys program is because, I had the opprotunity to see many different cultures or ways of life. Once, I got to go on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I also saw the Acropolis in Greece. Finally, I got to see many parts of China.

Thanks to the Seagoing Cowboys program, I have gained knowledge about Europe and China. Now, I hope that you will go and enjoy it too. Believe me, I have gone on the most trips of a Seagoing Cowboy... I know what I'm talking about.
