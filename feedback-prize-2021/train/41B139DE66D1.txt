Most people seek advice from multiple individuals when faced with a problem, and they have good reason too. Speaking to multiple people about advice can help the person searching for it open new doors. Seeking advice from others is highly beneficial because they can help the person see another point of view or help him or her see flaws or strengths in an already existing idea.

When someone asks multiple people for advice, that person is given the opportunity of seeing different points of view. Perhaps this person could see no other option but his or her own. But since all of our brains work differently, going to other people for new ideas could help open up other pathways to a solution.

Additionally, seeking advice from multiple persons may help the seeker see a flaw in an existing idea. Hearing what other people think about an individual's idea could help see what could be improved upon. Similarly, this could also help that individual see strengths that prove that his or her's initial idea is the right choice.

In conclusion, gathering advice from many people helps someone see new possibilities to an idea or see strengths and weaknesses of a preexisting one. Getting a fresh look at a problem can help someone see new ways it can be solved. Advice from others can also help critique an idea. The many people that seek advice from multiple sources are utilizing every tool they have access to.
