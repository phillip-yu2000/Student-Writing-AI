Yes, I would think that it's better for students to have online home class and for them to do there class works and home works at their houses. First reason why they should is because they would not get disracted by other students or things they could just be able to focus on wht the teacher is saying. The second reason why shudents should have online classes is that they can finish everything faster or on their own pace. The third reason why i think they should have it done at home is because they could get help from their parents or siblings if they are struggling with a homework or classwork. The forth reason why they should is that, if two students that are siblings and are taking the ame classes they could be able to do it together and they wouldn't struggle that much because they could depend on each other, but if they are both stuggling they could just have an online conversation with the teacher and get help from him/her. The fifth reason is that if the students took their tests at home they wouldnt be able to cheat on it because the school could have a website or an app that once you get in to an app and sign in and start the test you would not be able to get out of the app and if you do it would log out and once you get back in it would be locked until a parent is home so they could watch you take the test and so the teacher would unlock it once the parents let the teacher know that they would be home watching their child. The sixth reason why they should do that is because they could finish the class that they take faster than you would be able to finish in school because you would have it everyday and finish everything quicker and graduate easier. The last reason/benefit would be for the teachers they don't need to do that much paper work because everything is on the computer so the computer can just grade the students papers and also they teacher wouldnt have to leave the house instead of waking up extra early to do work they could wake up at 9 in the morning and start working at home.
