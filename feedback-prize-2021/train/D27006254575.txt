Dear Principal,

I don't understand why you need to have a B average to participate in activities. This policy is unfair to many of the students, who all happen to be just below the necessary mark for participation.

To reject a large number of the kids in the student body is not right. Knowing that majority of the kids do not meet your requirement, you should probably lower the average to a C. This is in our best interest as well as yours, why would you fund a sports program if there is five kids on the team? Kids need a way to have fun in school, to get rid of the pressure of grades and teachers. To deprive them of activities that do exactly that is wrong. The policy is like saying teacher can only have a job if they have brown hair, only a select few can work. the students love their clubs and sports, they should be able to be a part of them. Having a C average is not that bad, that should be the lowest that you allow. If this policy passes, you might lose funds, and quite possibly students. Most kids i know would tell their parents about this, and the parents would take them out because of lack of opportunity. It doesn't seem fair to single out so many of the students because the have grade that are average. I understand the need for a good education, but kids need time to relax and have some fun. Lets face it, a lot of kids hate school, but they love sports so suppling that would make kids like school a bit more. I hope you would reverse this policy, or a lot of people may not be coming back.

Sincerely,
