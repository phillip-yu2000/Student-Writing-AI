I would hate driverless cars. Now the only reason why I would hate it is because, I love to drive it is one of my favorite things to do. I would not be able to enjoy that if we had driverless cars, I mean yeah it would be cool but whats the point you will be spending more money then having a car and driving it yourself. No offense to Sergey Brin or anything not trying to crush your dreams but you have to think, this idea takes time, money, people willing to drive, and the strange one on one contact of who will be driving. I personly would only like it is if it would just pull up for you yeah the car driving by it's self would be cool but thats with only the car no one else, see when I read driverless cars I think of someone driving you around like "uber", but I what I would like to see is what I saw in The Avengers 2 Age of Ultron when Tony Stark pressed the button on his key fab and his orange convertible Audi R8 drove out of the garage and pulled up next to him. Thats what I want to see a car that can drive it's self but if it can only roll up to you then I would like that to but having someone drive you around would be weird, if it was a limo now thats a different story but other then that, I personly think this is a bad idea until they can master the car that can drive it's self until then keep trying.
