Have you ever see an alien? I bet you haven't, so why would you think that aliens would have built a face on Mars? There are numerous reasons why aliens didn't built this Face on Mars. To start off, it's not even a face, just a natural mesa that's been shaped over time. There's no evedence that aliens have made this mesa, and I'll tell you why.

One reason this Face wasn't made by aliens is the fact that the Face isn't even a Face. This Face is actually about the same thing as a mesa or a butte. It's not a Face built by aliens but actully a natural landform. The Face has most likely been there for years, just only looks like a face when it's shadow sets on it perfectly. It's just a natural landform that's change over time, creating the face everyone saw.

Another reason it wasn't made by aliens is that we have photo evedence. If you take a look at the photo's, you will notice that the one taken in 1976 and the one taken in 2001 are pretty identical. In the 1976 photo, you notice it's very blurry. In the 1998 photo, it's not as blurry but you can't really see a face, but in the 2001 picture, is where you csn tell the big difference. You can clearly see that it's not a face at all, just a natural landform on Mars. You can even tell on the landform where everyone thought the eyes, nose, and mouth went, which is why the illusion made it look like a face.

In this essay, I have proven that the Face on Mars isn't a face at all. The Face is actually the equivalent of a mesa or butte. I also used photo evedence to show that the Face is actually a natural landform. I've also explained why the Face was not made by aliens. I hpe you understand why the Face was just a natural landform and not made by aliens.
