My approach on drivless cars is, everything works perfectly, the car coudln't get better than that. It has sensors to notify you that there is an accident ahead, or a road blocik ahead. I got the following details from the passage. I would honestly buy one, it seems much, safer than the average car. When you drive the average car now people tend to get drunk and reckless drive. But the Driverless car prevents that because there are alot sensors.

I would rather drive the Driverless Car because it is much safer for younger drivers. The whole entire car is like a human steering the wheel, I read this part in the passage. " The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel." So the car is like a professional driver. Drunk drivers would be safer driving the driverless car, instead of a 2012 Impala. The driverless car is a much safer car for the community.

I have came to my conclusion that the driverless car is safer than an average car. The driverless car can steer itself, the driverless car has driven more than half a million miles without crashing, and the driverless car mimics the skill of a human at the wheel. So the driverless car couldn't be more safer.

The driverless car should honestly have alot of buyers because it's a good idea, I would rather have my son safe then sorry between driving an average car and an perfectly tested Driverless Car. It just seems alot more safer, I honestly think with all the upragdes it needs it is definitley worth it.
