Dear principal,

It has come to the student bodies' attention that you are reconsidering the cell phone policy.

I think that you should completely ban all cell phones from school forever.

If you think about it more bad things would come from being allowed to use our phones during school than good things.

If we are not allowed to bring our phones to school there will not be as many people that cheat on their school work.

Some people will ask each other what the answer to a question is via text message.

Another reason is that if we are allowed to have phones some people will go into the bathroom and use them for unethical purposes.

The first reason we should not be allowed to have phones is that people cheat.

Some of my best friends have sent me a text message in the middle of a test asking the answer to a question.

If we make our cell phone policies more strict we will not have to worry about that as much.

If we allow cell phones in school, even if we can just use them in free periods, people will still try to cheat in the middle of class because having the freedom to use your phone part of the time makes teenagers think that you use them all of the time.

The next reason that we should not be allowed to have cell phones during school is that people will take their phones and use them for bad things.

They will take dirty pictures and send them to each other, this is what they call "sexting."

I believe it is a horrible disgrace to any one who would ever do something like that, and I know you do not want that type of stuff going on in your school.

I know you have been thinking about what to do about the cell phone policy.

My opinion is that you should prohibit cell phones on school campus because people use their phones to cheat and to send bad pictures to each other.

Other students probably have different opinions than I.

I hope you make the right choice.

Thank you for taking your time to read this.

Sincerely,

A concerned student
