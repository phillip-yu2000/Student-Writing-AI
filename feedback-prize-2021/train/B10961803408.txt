Dear Principal,

Community service is important in the country of the

Untied

States.

Service in the community can change the place where one is working at.

Finding community service can be easy. It changes the person's character.

I think that the principal should make everyone do service in the community.

The service can change the place where is being done. The place can turn into a cleaner area.

The kids of the community would learn that helping can be a good thing.

The children would learn to not be in gangs.

Many people's life be changed there will less people getting hurt by gangs.

There be more people in collage.

The whole world will be changed.

Secondly finding community service would be easy to find.

Finding a community to help can be where you live at. A soup kitchen can be found near a locate church. There can be an old lady living next door that needs help with grocery. Or you can just donate coats to a coat drive in the winter.
