My position on the driverless car is that it could be useful. But at the same time it could end up being extremely dangerous. With the kind of world we live in, such a car could become a problem. And could have some safety an liability issuses. Here are some examples of how it could turn out to be a bad invention.

The added safety features don't include drivers who are texting. It's kinda pointless to have a driverless car if those heads-up safety features isn't limited to drivers who are trying to text while driving. New traffic laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident. If there is an accident, it will be hard to discern who is at fault for the accident, the manufacturer or driver.

With liability issuses like this it is much too risky to contine to make advancements on the car. There are one too many safety issuses with such a car. Faulty design, limited coverage, new traffic laws, boring,and so on. It is extremely pointless to even have started to invent such a car. And could turn out to be too much of an expensive investment for those who want to increase the manufacturing process.
