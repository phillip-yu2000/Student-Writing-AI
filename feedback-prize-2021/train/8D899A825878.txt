The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" says that studying Venus can be good for the human kind. As Earths 'twin' it could become a place humans may one day get to inhabbit. Since we cant yet we need to learn about it, like how to lessen the gravity or how to get breathable air there and how to cool it down so we can make it to Venuses surface.

We humans tend to want to learn and grow we try to strive for something better something to make out lives easiyer. To do this we studys and build things. The human population is growing we are gonna need to find a way to exspand the amout of living space we have, so why not go to space. Venus as Earths 'twin' could be the perfect canadate for the job.

Our modern tec could easily break in the conditiond that Venus has, so looking at our older tec that woulden't break so easily is a nice idea. "NASA is working on other aproches to study Venus. For exsample some simplified eletronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating Venus's surface and having lasted three weeks in such conditions" ( "The Challegne of Exploring Venus" paragragh 7).

The author shows all of their poins by giving facts to back up each of their parragraghs. This shows they knew what they were talking about and that they did their reserch. The author show problems and good things to show the pros and cons of this.
