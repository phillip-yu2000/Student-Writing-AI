I believe we should be required to do community service. I think its a big deal to us and others. People younger look up to us. It makes them feel that there is a lot of things that they can do. It makes people feel better on the inside. From reading to younger to picking up litter.

By picking up litter we are helping the earth. We are saving the animals and the people. We are helping animals because we are picking up things that can chock them. Or things that they eat but they shouldn't. We are helping people because its saving our earth. That produces more for us by us helping. If we helped we would have less things we would have to kill for.

We are also showing younger kids that taking a part in things like this is good. Even if it is reading to younger kids maybe that would encourage you to do more and you would want to make a big difference and you begin to take on more challenges. Then you start doing more and more. Kids would also like that other people care for them and they would like the fact that we want to help out.

People that think of it just as taking away there free time would learn a lot from the experience. They would start to enjoy it just as much as other people did. Also if you think about it, it would go good on a college application.

We should be required to do community service because it makes a very big difference. It makes people wonder a lot more about what else they could do to save the earth.

It helps yourself and others.
