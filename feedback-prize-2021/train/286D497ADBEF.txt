I highly disagree with "Driverless Cars". I have many reasons for my opionion being. After you read my essay, do you agree or disagree with me?

Technology is really starting to put a big impact on our world. Its starting to take over. Soon we are going to have robots doing almost everything for us. Doing our homework, making us food, babysitting our siblings, cleaning up our messes and so on. Do you really want this? The only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. You're risking your life in a way because anything could happen. Absolutely anything could go wrong. If the technology fails, you get into a severe car accident, what are you going to do? I dont think its worth getting in an accident or even causing an accident of someone else.

I highly recommend not driving in a driverless car. Be safe, for yourself and others. Car accidents could change your life in the worst way possible. Keep yourself out of harms way.
