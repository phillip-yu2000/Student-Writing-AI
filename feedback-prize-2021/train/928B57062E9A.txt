Driveless cars to me is just anither innnovative "American creation" that will be brought into this worlds lives. Driveless cars are the new idea being brought into car manufactoring to possibly help and chane our world. The upmost new technology will be involed making the cars "smart", safe, easy to use, and "fun".

I believe it will be a great idea to continue this development, just for the wait to see how this being apart in humans lives would effect us. This will be the new thing and because of the change tat is coming to our world, know one knows the effects that could occur with the models being out and about in the world.

These models could possible create conflicts that should be handled before these activities are amongst the everyday human life. In the article, the author explains how laws are more towards the drivers and not the cars. Now with driveless cars, the decisions should be disscussed now on new lawmaking before they're out and about.

Other than saftey issues, I believe just as in the article, that driveless cars would be fascinating new idea and a change in the world that people would want to see weather its the new "fun" thing, or a fail that could use work.
