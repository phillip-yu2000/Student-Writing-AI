Having the students have at least a B average is good idea. I think that putting it at a B average is better idea because, it will bring up their academic responsibilities. It will also help bring up their maturity by helping them know that they have to give something to get something. And they will learn that their are certain restrictions to get certain privileges, such as playing in school sports. And the school sports may also bring their grades down because of them not doing homework due to game and practices. Also making it a B average will make it better for the students because they need their education to get them somewhere in life. being at a B average is not hard or not too easy it has it's right level of everything and is expected if wanting to be in extra curricular sports.

I also think that students would take more pride in going to school and their school work because they will depend on their grades to get what they desire. I also think that the students will care more about the school environment more and start to learn how to grow up and mature faster. The average grade is at the right level to help them with their future and building their plan of life. Also that sports aren't always everything to everyone and that they expect something from you other than winning the conference and being champions. There will be a rise in their maturity and responsibility that will help them build their future and help them deal with the ways of life
