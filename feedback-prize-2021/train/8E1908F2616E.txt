Dear Principle,

I believe that students should be performing community service because it would really help the environment. It does not matter if they are picking up the litter or tutoring others, as long as they are trying to help the environment.

My first reason why students should perform community service is because it would help the environment. Then if other people see the students doing community service they might want to help too. Now wouldn't that be terrific? Just seeing others help out makes me want to do more for the environment.

My next reason on why students should perform community service is because it can save lives. For example, the amount of garbage we throw out every day adds up very fast. Soon the whole world will be filled with garbage and we will not have any place to put it. Then people could get very sick from just breathing in the fumes. I really hope that you take this into consideration.

My third and final reason on why students should perform community service is because it gives them something to do. Kids often go home and just sit on the couch and watch television. If you consider having a student community service program I know for a fact that I wouldn't just go home and be lazy, I would get all geared up and go out to find someplace that might need a little more cleaning up to do.

Now please consider on getting a big group of students to help out the environment. Thank you for your time and just think about it, it might save somebody's life someday, or even today.
