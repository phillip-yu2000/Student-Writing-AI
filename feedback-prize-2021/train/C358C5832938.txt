If my principal has decided that all students had to participate in an extracurricular activity I would disagree with the decision of him or her. All students should have the right to chose to participate in an after or before school activity.

First and for most, an extracurricular activity is something you would do after or before school. If you have something after school say like a family reunion or, a game for another team the people or student's involved in the extracurricular would have trouble committing to the program.

Second, If a family or just the student's had more important stuff to do. Like going home to help the family or, take care of his or her brother or sister because the mom and dad are working late and to, even provide company and care for the family. The extracurricular activity is stopping them to provide support for their family and thank their mom and dad for working so hard every dad just to let me have my siblings.

Third, Students serve seven hours of school five day's a week for the whole year if we were to add the extracurricular activity after school every day students could be going from seven hours of school to eight hours of school. Instead students should be able to go home and do their home work then could play video game's or go out side and explore or go play wiffle ball. how would students enjoy to take one hour out of their free time to do an extracurricular activity then enjoy time with their friend's . My point is extra hours of school is wasting their childhood.

In Conclusion, extracurricular activities will cause people to miss out on stuff even if some of that stuff is not really that important. School in total takes a way some of are child hood and if we add extra time on to that it will fly by. If you do not agree with me then that is OK because we dont need extra after school activity's .
