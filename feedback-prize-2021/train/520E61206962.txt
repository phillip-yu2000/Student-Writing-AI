Driverless cars seem like something that would come out of a movie, not very realistic, a thing form the future. How would one even invent something like this? Roads are unpredictable. Are smart cars really ready for anything?

Smart cars may not be ready, but smart roads are. Imagine it. A car that follows the road. Too bad it would cost billions and billions to replace every single road.

Let's say cars would be able to drive without smart road. What would happen if an accident were to accure or if there was major traffic? Would cars be able to menuver around? What about state laws? In paragraph 9, it states that in most states it is illegal even to test driveless cars. Why would that be? People claim that it would be safer to have driverless car, but would it be illegal if it was considered safe. Plus, what would be good about taking jobs away from bus and taxi drivers?

Driverless cars seem like a fantasy. Are smart cars the way to go? Or should we focus on the problems in hand? Having driverless cars would just put the country in debt.
