Dear Principal,

Students like to have cell phones with them at all times. I also like to have mine with me as well. Although it is a concern for some of the faculty and staff at the schools. I agree with you of the policy that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times. Why do I say this? Because, no matter what, students will still have their cell phones no matter where they are.

I may remind myself that I also like to use my cell phone too. I encourage you to let students bring their cell phones, but turn them off during school hours. Such as being in class. Texting, I think, is a great solution instead of talking on the phone. But, talking may be faster for some people. I for one, like to text whenever I can. But, I usually don't text that often, unless I need to speak with one of my parents or siblings. That, I think, is why students should only text whenever they can. But, as you may have noticed, some students don't have cell phones.

Students should have a cell phone just in case of emergencies. For example, let's say that a student's mother got into a car accident and needed to be taken to the hospital. The student would have to be picked up from school from his or her father. But, they didn't know that because they didn't have a cell phone. What would they do? Simply I think the office would tell them the news of what just happened. But, what if they didn't have phones in the office? Then the student would have to have a cell phone with them at all times.

So, I encourage you to make a choice. A choice of what to do in an emergency or needed to speak to a parent or sibling. So, it's your choice.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
