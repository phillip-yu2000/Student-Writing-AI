CELLULAUR DEVICES

I personally think it is a alright idea to let us bring our phone to school and let us them when we have free time .you can get you friends number or text the person across the aisle from you. You may exchange music and that sort of stuff BUT..

Everybody so stuck up on wanting to bring there cell to school that when you can there not even going to use it as if when they couldn't. See when you cant get something you have temptation ,your always going to do the opposite if what your pose to do. Like for instance your mom told you to study what are you going to do get on your computer or your phone ,the opposite if what your suppose to do.

And what about the problems it would bring .Example when there is going to be a fight you got your cell so you can text everybody and tell there were, who what ,why ,and when. Also the answers who and the worlds not going to text you the answers to the test on Friday who. I mean you ask hem hey gong to text you it.

But what if somebody irresponsible lose their phone and they momma is one of the crazy people who will make you pay for a 1,000 dollar phone do you really want your put yourself in that position just think about.
