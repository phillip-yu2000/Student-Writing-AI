Car usage is one of the biggest reasons that as to why there is so much air pollution in the world. Buying more will just make the problem grow. This is why we should limit the use of cars and start thinking of other ways to get around such as walking or riding a bike.

One of the reasons that we should limit car usage is because, it's one of the main causes that the Earth is so unhealthy. Using cars cause more and more greenhouse gas emissions. If we are able to reach a community with very little car use then those people without a car will not only be saving money, but also preventing greenhouse gas emission. Many people will also be able to get more excercise because they won't be driving everywhere, but they will be walking or bicycling. Many people also stress out due to not having enough money to finish paying for a car, or to fill their car up with gas. Most of those problems will go away if they just limit or stop their car usage. In Bogota, Colombia, for the third straight year, cars have been banned, and only taxis and buses have been allowed on the streets. Many people are enthusiastic on participating and wouldn't even let rain stop them from arriving at their destination. he goal was to reduce smog and so far, they have been reaching their goal. Another city that has recently had a car free days has been Paris, France. Paris enforced a partial driving ban due to days of near-record pollution. the amount of smog Paris had was enough to rival that of Beijing's which is known as the most polluted city in the world. After a couple of days, the smog cleared enough for cars to be allowed to be used again.

Those are only some of the few reasons as to why car usage should be very limited, many people don't realize it, but if we don't do something about the amount of air pollution that we have, it may be too late to save the planet Earth.
