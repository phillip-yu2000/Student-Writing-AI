Hello Mr. senator, today i would like to talk about the Electoral college. The electoral college is not a place its a process,

its where the founding fathers make the constitution hwere people could vote by the citizens.

First,  to some people the lelctoral college could be a good thing or some people dont like it. like for example voters dont vote for the president they vote for slate of electors. then the ones woth the most they detreman who will become the next presiden. i dont  really like the way tha is works i feel like we should just vote for the president. alsop its kinda confusing with the hole electrol votes and like florida has 34 electoral votes.

Second, who picks the elector in the first place? is it us is the other senator who? also when there is a tie and it has to go in the house of representatives then they chose like what is there is more demcratic thats kinda of unfair. but i understand about why they like it too.

conclusion, I could understand why people like it to for example they actually let the people chose istead of not and then the world just gets crazy. Also it is what our founding fathers created and they had to compermize it.
