Dear principal,

With the first policy if you allow students to have cell phones at all in school they will use them when they can get away with it. They will text message in class behind teachers backs, in the library, in the restrooms anywhere they can. If cell phones were a problem before do not allow kids to have them during school.

Many kids will not break this rule but some kids if they need a way to contact there parents will not have one if you go with policy two. Or if they need a ride home. I need my phone right after school to see when my dad is picking me up, if we had car troubles, when someone is picking me up and more. I think if a student is caught with a cell phone they should have a sort of punishment of keeping the phone for the rest of the school day but not days at a time.

My dad believes that texting was invented to talk to someone when your not supposed to. I agree that texting is a secretive way to talk. There are new cell phones everyday that are know smaller and it makes them easier to carry it around with out people realizing that they have it. There are faster ways to text to so it would give students more time to text and more time to get away with it.

If you want your students to be aloud to walk around with those possibilities, to break school rules without you ever knowing it even happens. Then go with policy one but if you just want a cell phone free school use policy number two.
