Don't Fear, Ask Your Peers!

Have you ever done something stupid? Well, if you got someone else's opinion before you did it, would you have done it? Seeking others opinion before doing something is helpful because you get many different view points and reduces the chances of risk.

First, everyone has many different experiences,that means we all can have different view points. Having differentÂ view points can help you make wise and profound dissensions. People often need help with school assignment. Asking for others view points on a project or homework can help someone do better on it and get a better grade. Another example is sports, getting someone else's opinion can help improve your playing style and skill level. Also, when get more then one view point, you are more likely to do the right thing. For example, if someone is doing something questionable, someone who has done it or seen the consequences of doing it, can attempt to stop them.

Secondly, if you ask for others opinions before you act, you reduce the chances of risk. While yes, risk can sometimes be a good thing, it can also be a bad thing. For example, someone is trying to jump off the roof of their house to impress their friends. If someone doesn't tell them to stop they may hurt themselves or others. Another, less stress educing example is, someone wants to use profanity in their English paper for excitement. If someone tell them to stop, the risk of getting in trouble is greatly decreased or goes away altogether. It it always best to recuse stress.

In conclusion, ask for others opinions. Everyone makes mistakes and its okay but It is extremely helpful to ask for your peers opinion because it can help reduce risk and you can get many different view points.
