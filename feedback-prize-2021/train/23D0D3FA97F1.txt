There are many reasons self-driving cars are not possible at our current level of technology, one of them being the safety concern. In it's current state, it is also basically useless because of how little it can actually do.

In the article, it makes more than one point about how the self-driving car can be a hazard to the passangers and the other people driving, "If the technology fails and someone is injured." This is one point about how it can be dangerous. The risk of someone being injured because someone does not want to drive is not worth it in my eyes. These types of cars should not be introduced until there is a near guarentee that they will not harm any civilians or other drivers.

Another point that is made in the article is that there is already this type of technology but it can only "... handle functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." What is the point of having the car drive itself if you have to be at full attention, with your hands on the wheel? Once again we don't have the technology to make this practical. If anything this makes it harder on experienced drivers, they're so used to driving the same way for their entire life, and they will have to learn a different type, even though it's not necessary.

In conclusion, the self-driving car should not be introduced until it is proven to be better than humans driving themselves. It should also not be introduced until there is a near guarantee that it is safer than humans driving themselves.
