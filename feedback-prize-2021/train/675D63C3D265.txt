Have you ever had a problem that you couldn't solve with out asking for advice? When i have a problem i ask people for their opinion on what to do because some times i'm not sure what to do and, the best thing for me is asking multiple people for advise. I think its better to ask more than only one person for advise because it can help me make a better choice. But other people when they have a problem only ask one person they trust the most and don't ask more people because they are shy or, don't want to talk to other people about their problems.

Some times when i ask some one for advise they don't know what to tell me or, they don't give me good advise so i have to ask other people. After i hear everyone's advise i pick witch one i think is best and witch one will help me the most and, to help me make a better choice. Making a choice on what to do is hard but with the advise they give it's easier to think what i'm going to do. When i have multiple opinionsÂ it makes me do better choices because i have different opinions witch i can pick from.

I think it's better getting multiple opionis so then i can pick witch one i think well help me make a better choice. But however some other people think its best to only ask one person.
