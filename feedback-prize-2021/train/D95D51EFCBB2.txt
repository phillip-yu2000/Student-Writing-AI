Dear Principal,

My Name is STUDENT_NAME and I'm a student here. I think community service should be required for many reasons. First I have 120 Hours of community service over my one and a half years at SCHOOL_NAME and they weren't that hard to get. Second it makes you a better person by just one act of kindness. Third it a chance for students to help out in there community.

First there is a class here called community service and leadership in that class you are required to do at least 10 hours of community service. I took the class and ended up doing really well so now I'm one of 16 kids in our school who are junior advisers. It's kind of like a student council. I went above and beyond 10 and got 48 by the end of the school year last year. I found it kind of fun to be honest. Now since then I have gotten 72 hours. I Think that every kid should try for ten.

Second it makes you feel good one time I escorted senior citizens to there seats in a theater then took there walkers. Then at the end of the show I brought all the walkers back and gave them to each person. When I got home I felt good for such a simple thing and I think students don't realize how much it does for yourself.

Finally its a chance to see what kind of things are going on in the community and to get involved. One time I volunteered at a ware house where they put together luminaries in kits. Before then a bag would just be on my door step in mid December with stuff to make luminaries, I never really thought where they came from or who put them together.

So Personally I think every student and possibly teachers in our school should be required to take at least 10 hours of community service.
