Dear principle ,

Hello principle of this school this is one of the students that go here . I was just writing you a letter to tell you why you shouldn't change the policy here . I know getting good grades is always the best for us kids but playing sports is great for us too . & some of us kids aren't that smart when it comes to hitting the books .

That doesn't mean you should punish us by not being able to play sports at school .

My point of view of this policy is that it shouldn't be this way , kids should have a say in it to right ? Well i know a lot of boy's & girls who only have a C average , & most play sports .

What if you did go along with this plan & changed the policy . Do you know how much kids you are going to get hurt ? & they might even want to start dropping out in high school cause they just can't get there grades up . School just isn't that pleasant anymore .

There are a lot of mean kids who put us down & make us feel stupid because they have A' s & B' S . & we only have C' s &

D' s .

Just because we have a C doesn't mean we shouldn't be able to play sports . Did you know a C average is passing ?

Well if it's passing why do we have to bring it up to a B ?

There are a lot of reason's why i think you shouldn't go along with this . But i just gave you a few of my main reasons why you shouldn't . & i know a lot of other kids who would fill the same as i do .

So i hope you will understand why i wrote this letter to you .

Sincerely , STUDENT_NAME(:
