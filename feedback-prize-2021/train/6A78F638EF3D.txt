Dear Principal ,

I think that you should reconsider using Policy 1 . Everyone would love if you decided to let us use our cell phones at school during lunch period and other free periods. One reason i think why you should reconsider it is because some students may need to talk to their parents or something incase of an emergency during school. Or they may need their parents to bring some homework they left at home by accident . I mean , who WOULDN'T want to come to this school if we had a rule like that. And if some student didn't turn their phone off during class and it went off , the teacher should send them to you since they didn't follow the rules. Some students have activities after school , so if the students wouldn't be able to bring their phone to school and they needed a way to get home , it wouldn't be good .

So that's why i think you should let all students bring our cellular devices to school . Thanks .
