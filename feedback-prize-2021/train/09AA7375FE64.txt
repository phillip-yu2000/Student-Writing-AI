Asking several people for advice can give you a more beneficial response. Let's say you have a massive test, your friend has already taken this test. You ask him, "Should I study?" He responds with, "No, it was easy." So you just go with his advice and you don't study. You get to the test day and you realize don't know anything about it, you end up failing the test. If you had just asked your other friends for advice as well, you would've known that it was hard and that you needed to study. You shouldn't just ask one person for advice, they can't just be the end-all-be-all decision maker. You should ask several people whether or not you should do something. A person can be invalid, bias, or even wrong, that's why you consult more than one doctor when you have bad news. Maybe the other doctor realizes something the first one didn't. It's also precisely why consulting more than one person for advice can give a better answer.
