Driverless cars? I honeslty think driverless cars would be dangerous. I think that because you never know what could happen. The car might explode due to all the things in the car thats making it drive on its on. The car might over work its self, and maybe cause car crashes as well, and car crashes are not want we need!

Car crashes are big things that don't need to happen all time, well I know they happen alot during these days but driverless cars? i just feel like with driverless cars its going to happen a whole lot more. Driverless cars to me feel like they would cause more car trouble, with all the explosions and disfunctioning and especially all the techniques and material that would go inside the car, to make it function on its on, Causing explosions because all of the material over working that car.

So, thats why agree on not having driverless cars. Its unneccessary to have driverless cars, when people made cars for a reason, so that people can DRIVE the cars. Not for the cars to work on ther own. What's the point of having a driverless car? MIght as well just walk if you want to have a driverless car!
