Some scools offer distance learning as an option for students. In my opinion i think students would benifet from being able to take classes from home.

To begin with, students would have a less likely chance of being bullied because they feel more comfortable at home than out where someone can make fun of them for being differnet bullying is a big issue in schools and is one of the number one issues that lead to suicide and school shootings in americ. If students have can learn from home they would be less likely to face problems like that at home.

As a reslut, some students may be fighting anxiety or depression and can not deal with all the stress that come wwith school if they are more comtorable with being home, Then they are most likely better off being home or somewhere else learning where they can focus and not worr a whole lot about things.

Letting kids learn from a distance will also make the graduation rate go up because kids wont be together to skip and kids wont incourage other kids to do drugs as much.

Last but not least, students in a group together is not a good idea because of fights and arguments. Studies show people in a crowded area are more likely to fight than in a small are because not evryone are the same they dont share the same ideals. But if students can learn in a environment that they are comfotablle with with and are not a group fight it would also solve fights in schools.

In conclusion, as we can conclude students who have a chance to have distance learning have a higher chance of making the wrong choices in lifemlike being encouraged to do drugs and have a lower chance of being bullied. Some kids also have anxiety and deppresion as result students are better off learing from a distane without any worries.
