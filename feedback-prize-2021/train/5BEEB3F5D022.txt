I don't think that she should do this because a lot of kids are all ready in sports that have a c average and making them work more will take away time from there sport and a lot of people would get kicked out of there sport for having bad grades.

The kids should be able to have a c average because they disserve to play in that sport and not have to worry about studying so much wile there playing. And either way there playing for the school so if the school does not want any athletes to be representing there school then go ahead an make it a b average and you can go out there and play for the school.

I also think that kids should have a b average to play because then they will be purposely failing there class and not care and it is a privilege to play a sport knowing that you are representing the school and you should study and become a smart and healthy living person to have a better career so you can be prepared for the future.
