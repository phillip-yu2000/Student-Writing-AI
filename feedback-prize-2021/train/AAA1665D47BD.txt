The face that you seem to see on Mars is just a big misunderstanding. Many conspiracy theorists have made up stories about this face in order to get money and popularity. Even though it is actually just a mesa in the middle of Mars, located in Cydonia. There are many mesas in the western United States and aren't made from any alien race.

This article states that the Face is,"formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." This illusion is what conspiracy theorists use to make it viral. It also proves how there is no face at all. It is all just a big shadow of a mesa in Cydonia.

On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Michael Malin and his team used the Mars Orbiter Camera to take photographs of the face. These photographs were ten times sharper than those of the previous Viking missions. They revealed that is was just a natural mesa and there wasn't anything to do with aliens at all.

April 8, 2001 was a day that completely changed and confirmed that there was nothing more than a mesa in Cydonia. The Mars Orbiter Surveyor can take pictures with one pixel being 1.56 meters, while the early Viking photographs had pixels that were 43 meters. This high definition camera took a picture of the face again. Being able to zoom in up to 3 times larger than the normal picture, the team found out there weren't any structures or figures on the face.

There is plenty of evidence that can prove there isn't anything wrong with the area in Cydonia. Going from high defintion photographs with modern technology to zoom in and spot out evidence or old photos showing shadows of the mesa walls. There are plenty of conspiracies that have been proven false by these photos and research of the NASA workers. This has proven that the Face on Mars was never actually a face or alien structure, but a normal everyday mesa.
