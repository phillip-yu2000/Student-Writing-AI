Dear TEACHER_NAME,

What are you thinking? Why are you considering making it a B grade average to play sports? I love playing sports but i have a C grade average. It's not fair when all of a sudden you think about make this rule change. Some people might have very good grades, good for them, but most likely they are not playing sports all year long. The rule should be if you have a passing grade, not a B grade average. If you noticed, everyone heard about this new rule, or policy you are thinking about and they are trying to keep their grades up all the time, it's just really hard. I know you are just thinking about this new policy, but you are going to have a lot of complaints if you actually make this a new rule.

Have you ever loved something so much, and then someone just takes it away? Well that's what you are doing to us. If you were in this position you would do whatever it takes to make sure you can still play in your school sports and activities. Am I right? I know your just doing it for us; to make sure we all have good grades, and eventually do something we want to do in the future, but we are in the present right now, and what we want to do now is play sports. If you make it a B grade average, we are probably going to have no sports teams anymore, because we will be studying our butts off, and will have no time to practice our favorite sports or get to hang out with our friends. We will also not have the grades to stay on the team.

It may sound like I'm being pushy, but I'm not, I'm standing up for what my classmates and I love, and that's sports. It's just that it seems like you're asking a lot from middle school kids. I hope you will take this letter into consideration, and keep the rule how it is, and not make it a B grade average.

Thank you,
