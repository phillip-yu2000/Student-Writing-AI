In my opinion people ask for others opinion because they dont know if they should do something so they ask people and get there opinion. therefor if you need some ones opinion you can just ask people to give you there opinion and you can see if you like what they are telling you. also if you need some good advice you can ask your mom and dad because they will not lie to you but if you go walking on the street the people on the street might lie to you for,example if you walk in the streets of Generic_City people are probably not going to help you but, if you say hey mom I need some advice on blah blah blah she is probablyÂ going to say OK and then se is going to tell you what she thanks.

At the beginning of my passage I sad no one would give you good advice but, I forgot to say there is some good people in the would. If you wanted to beter choice and you had bad freinds the might just want to see you fight of you and a nother person. afterthat you get in trouble and then the call your mon and trust me you dont want that.
