Limiting car usage can be helpful as we try to reduce our negative impact on this great big miracle of a planet. Reducing or even eliminating the use of cars would greatly drop the amount of damage done to the ozone. Even then, some people living without cars found their life to be less stressful. Aside from these two simple solutions, a life without cars can save so much more.

First off, without cars the pollution that's depleting our ozone would be nearly gone. The gas emissions from tailpipes account for 12% of greenhouse gas emitions, and in some places even 50%! Life this advanced on a single planet in this great big universe is such a miracle. We need to protect our planet from greenhouse gasses if we wish to continue to exist on this planet.

Secondly, not only do cars cause a great deal of life threatening polution, but some people living without their cars found their life to be less stressful. Owning a car is not only expensive due to maintainance but because of these fluctuating gas prices! If you were to sell your car now and either walk, bike, or ride the city bus to work or school you would save thousands. While keeping city busses would still cause some pollution it's not as great the amount of pollution as millions of cars. Also, walking would help keep the world in shape since it is a great way of exersize.

In conclusion, getting rid of cars would be the best thing we can do for the planet. Not even getting rid of them but at least reducing the risk of them. It would keep the world in shape, and keep your money in your wallet. All of this while reducing the harm we are doing on our miraculous planet.        Â
