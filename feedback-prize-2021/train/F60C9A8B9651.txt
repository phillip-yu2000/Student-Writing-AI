Dear state senator,

I've come to the conclusion that most U.S. citizens want to abolish the Electoral college. For the reasons being is because the american people vote for the presidents we want for our country, not the state electors choosing for us. As in the source of "what is Electoral college?" (The Office of the Federal Register), state's, "you help choose your state's elector when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors". what's whrong with the electoral college you may ask? Accordingly "under the electoral system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president" state's source two "The Indefensible Elctoral College" (Bradford Plumer).

What Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and etc. had in common was abolishing Electoral college. Supposedly they are not the only ones; "according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"(Bradford Plumer). As most peolpe believe: the electoral college is unfair, unreasonable, and just simply outdated.
