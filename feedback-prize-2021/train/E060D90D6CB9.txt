Dear Principal

I don't agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress.

If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment's in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything.

If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldn't have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea.

I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future.

Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me.

I wouldn't like it if I have to worry about my school work and my favorite sport. I hope that you will change your mind after reading this note.

Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME
