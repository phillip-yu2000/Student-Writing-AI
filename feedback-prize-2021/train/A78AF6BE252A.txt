The idea of driverless cars sounds pretty amazing right?

Driving in a car and not having to lift a muscle sounds like the life to live. Being rode around all day,not even when you have to pick your kids up from school or practice. Lavish right?

Now what if I told you,you had to be alerted when you have to pull in somewhere, dealing with traffic issues,road blocks, pedestrians, and most importantly,pot holes! Nobody want's to be going 60 on the freeway and unexpectedly rise out of there seat's because of a pot hole launched them into the air! Think about all the little animal's thats in the road that won't be avoided due to the "Driverless car".

Heres another reason driverless cars aren't worth waiting for. Remember how fun driving looked to you as a kid? How you just couldn't wait to get out of the backseat and into the driver seat? Even the passenger seat at that! Now what will we tell our kids when they want to drive,and the streets are filled with driverless car's. It could probably put alot of kids out of the dream job as a NASCAR racer too.

To be real,and completley honest. Driveless cars should just be in "Television and movies" like quoted in the second paragraph. They aren't the safest way to travel. There are so many variables that could change in the street that would completley catch the car off guard! I think that we should just keep it to the hands on steering wheel. It maybe old fashioned,but I gurantee you'll miss every pot hole and squirrel without it!
