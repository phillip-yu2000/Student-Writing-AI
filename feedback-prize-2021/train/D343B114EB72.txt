The way the future is coming to the future vehicals are quite interesting and they havea lot of good things for the environments, but having these Driverless cars may not be the best thing ever because of the way they are used by which the children are now not have to learn to drive. Having the responceability to have licens and a lot of kids will take advantage of it so im gonna say that the Driverless Cars are good for us, the atmosphere, the people with money and down payments on vehicals. Not most people have vehicals because of the payment range and if we can change that who knows we might not have to have buses, taxi, etc any more, and the people will have more money to take care of their children and its also gonna help with car crashes and lowering how many we have every year or so. Allowing kids16+ to drive the less crashes will help majorly. Also with the insureance itll cost less but will the insurance go out of buisness ? If the law says we do have to still have insurance to have a vehical we buy then i doubt that theyll go out of buisness.
