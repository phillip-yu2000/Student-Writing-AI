Taking classes at home should be a last resort for a student. In today's society it is a privilege to go to school and have a teacher there to help. In addition, students would't have the encouragement from teachers to get work done on time. Finally, if you were at home you would miss out on the social aspect of school.

Everybody has a different way of learning, some are visual others might be hands on. If a student is at home they might not understand everything that is happening. For instance, my friend Generic_Name is really good at math but, if she had to learn chemistry on her own it would be hard and take longer. Which in the end she would be behind on the course and have to move on without understanding.

High school students are good at putting things off til the last minute. Personally, if I am given work to take home it doesn't get done on time. Therefore, if students are expected to do all of their school work at home it wouldn't get done. Without the teachers push for students to get work in on time, they would do it whenever they felt like it.

The social aspect of schooling is what makes it fun to be there.

A social part of school is making friends to hangout in and out of school. Also as long as you take your required core classes you get to pick fun classes to fill your schedule with. You pick electives that interest you, also ones that you and your friends might have together. For example, this year I took anatomy and got a class with three of my good friends in it.

Going to school can make getting an education exciting. However, school isn't for everyone, there is many situations where it might be best for the student to do online classes. Going to school would set the students up for their future plans. Altogether online school shouldn't be seen as the only alternative if a student isn't excelling in their studies.
