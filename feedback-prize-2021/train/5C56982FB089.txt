Sometimes electoral vote elects the right president sometimes. But knowing u can have more individual votes than the other canidate and lose to that person all because they have more electoral votes sounds wrong.

2000 election biggest presidecial controversity since 1888. Al Gore vs. George W. Bush 2000 election Al wins majority individual votes but Bush wins since he had majority electoral votes(271 to 266).many people beleive the electoral colledge should be demolished because the people are supposed to vote for the person they want for president not the state.

538 is the number of electoral votes. But only 270 is needed to automatically become the president. The problem is there are states with 3 and there are states with 20 it seems unfair to some states because they may be small compaired to some states but isn't fair if we just abolish the electoral colledge. it gives the people what they want and it puts the right president in charge.

Its a great idea to abolish the electoral colledge it makes the people happy and if we make a wrong choice its are fault we can deal with it we've been through way worse.
