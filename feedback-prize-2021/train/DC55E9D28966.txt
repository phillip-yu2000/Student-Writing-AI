Could you ever dream of never having to drive a car again? Well that dream might be closer to reality than you think. Recently Google and a bunch of other manufacturing companies have been trying to make that dream posible. They are invisioning a public transportation system. That they think would be more safe than having a human behind the wheel.

I would honestly love to live in a world where we didn't have to drive anymore. According to Google their semi-driverless cars would use half of the fuel a normal car would use. I mean come on who wouldn't like to same money on fuel. Now the only thing these cars lack are that they are not fully driverless. Which means you would still have to keep your hands on the wheel at all times incase you need to take control of the car.

How much would one of these cost? Imagine all of the equipment one of these cars have, and how expensive these cars would be? They have tons of sensors a rotating laser on the top of the car so it can locate its surroundings. Despite how expensive these cars are I think they would make the world a lot better. I mean if you have smarter roads and smarter cars then you wouldnt have to worry about accidents.

These cars have seats that viberate when their is an alert. Their is also a windshield display that will alert you as well. Before an error occurs the car will tell the driver when to take over. These cars would be much better on smarter roads. But when you look at it they would have to modify every road and thats to expensive fro reality.

So when it comes down to it I think driverless car would bea revolutionary product. That would change the world forever. I say we should do it, what do you think? Hopefully we will have them on the roads in a couple of years and they wont be as expensive as we think.
