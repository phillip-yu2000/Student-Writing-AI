I think there shouldn't be driveless cars because what if they have a malfunction in the system and it becomes out of control and someone gets hurt. We can't trust eletric items or things we can't control to have control of our lives. That just isn't safe.

People can't trust cars to drive themselves because the car itself can't handle some human sitituations like pulling in and out the driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. The cars are going to be to expensive anyways because not everyone on Earth is making enough money to buy one of these cars.

The cars might be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they all rely on the driver to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Traffic laws are still written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times letting us know that driverless cars aren't "driverless" at all. What if it rained hard outside and the streets were flooded and roads were blocked, is the driverless car going to try to go through it anyway?

Why want a driverless car that still needs a driver,and if it is driverless its not like you can go send it to go pick up someone. It might be fun or cool to have a driverless car, but its not safe. What if the technology fails and someone is injured, its not the driver's fault, its the manufacturer's fault for creating the "driverless car" in the first place. We are doing just fine driving the cars ourselves. At least then we will know what and who to trust.
