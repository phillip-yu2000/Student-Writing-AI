Fellow citizens all over the world. Cars are not nessisary. There are a bunch of great reasons why limiting car usage has its advantages. A couple of reasond are that it's good for the environment, you will save a bunch of money, more exersize and less acidents.

If citizens limited their car usage, it would be a whole lot better for the environment. Driving everywhere in your car wastes gas and that goes into the air that we breathe. It is not good what cars are doing to the air. They are poluting our air, trees cannot convert it to oxygen. We are stuck with the gas that come from the cars in the air.

You will save a great amount of money by not spending it on gas to drive everywhere. Gas is not cheap and wont last forever. Its about $3.00 a gallon sometimes even more than that. If you save your money and not spend it on gas and just walk, you can save it and spend it on something useful.

When you think about limiting your car usage, you  can think about getting more exersize. imangine a nice day and you walk  down a strees to go to the store to pick up something small; you can smell the beautiful flowers. Fell the breeze that hits you just right and the sun shinning down on you just the way you like it. You would not be able to experince any of that if you were in your car driving to the store. The best part of car limiting is that there would be less acidents on the road. A great amount of people get injured or killed because of cars. If we did limited our cars usage, people would not die or get injured from cars.

Limited car usage for our fellow citizens has its great advanteages. A hand full of reasons why we should, but if we compare the facts of a car free place. It would be a nicer, safer, and a better place to live.
