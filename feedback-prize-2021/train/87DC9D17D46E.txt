Dear principle

I think u should at least have a B average to go out and do any kind of sports because going out and having fun playing a sport is a privilege. If students had a C average there not rally learning anything and that mean u need to try a little harder if u want to do any kind of sports student need to have at least a B because they need to and if they don't then they shouldn't be in any kind of sport but i see if you a struggling in class then maybe but you should have the right. Right now I'm at a solid A to B average and i am very proud of that.

Having an A average is awesome, having a B average yah your good but i think when your getting down to a C average, your just kind of getting lazy. That's my word, any way. Having good grades means every thing to me so it should matter to every one because school is important and you need it to get a good and worthy job.

Sincerely
