The technology to read the emotional exspressions of student is a classroom is valuable because the computer can express how we feel, it can tell if your bored or not, some think the computers need to learn nonverbal communication.

The computer can tell your emotion. Dr. Paul Eckman the creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) has classified six basic emotions they are happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness. They each associate with the characteristic movement of the facial muscles.

The computer can tell if your bored or not. they have indicated the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile. A real smile or in other words the Ztgomatic major ( muscles that begain at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius.

Some think the computers need to learn non verbal communication. In the article it says imagine a computer that knows your happy or sad. for example, if you smile when the web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might fallow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer can tell if the students are becoming confused or bored. Dr. Huang thinks he can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructer. " Most humans Communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."

Notes Dr. Huang " So Computers Need to Understand that, too."

Yes this is valuable in a classroom. this is because computers express how we feel, they can tell if your bored or not, and some people think they need to learn nonverbale communication.
