The Seagoing program teaches you how to have athority and percistence. That program changed my life forever;and it might change yours to. The Seagoing program has lots of things to do like,take care of horses,young cows,and mules that weren't on shore,they were shipped overseas. There might be people in the world that don't care,but wouldn't you want to help an helpless animal.

There are a lot of people that try and try to find a job but it is so hard working two jobs, or your working a lot of hours,or maybe you don't have a job at all,but the Seagoing program helps you with all of that. They even say that 44 nations joined TOGETHER to form the "UNRRA" (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Actually the UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys to help animals and stuff,so the Seagoing Cowboys are in really good hands. The Seagoing Cowboys also helped with World War ll with recovering food suplies,animals,and more. We put up a really good program for people that need jobs.

The Seagoing Cowboys also get to travel a lot. We get to go to places like China,Europe,and New Orleans for buisness trips. We help many people around the world and we fight strong and get the work done. The work that we do shows people that they have a good life it might not be the best but they get to see and help others. At the end people the Cowboys did get to relax so played baseball and volleyball,some played table-tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,it is not all work sometimes you get to sit back and think you just help a loyal country out today,that shows kindness and honor.
