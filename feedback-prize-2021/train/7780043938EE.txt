When it comes to advice, it's very important that you are getting the correct advice. Receiving wrong advice can be a vital mistake in whatever you're doing. Asking only one individual can lead you to the wrong advice. One person limits yourself to the knowledge and experience you could've received from various people. That is why it's very important to listen to multiple inputs on how other people feel.

Receiving advice from one person is not always the smartest decision. Asking someone who lacks knowledge in that topic has a high chance of giving you wrong information. Asking multiple people who have knowledge about that topic will most likely give great advice. Multiple people with great knowledge will help you have the retain the most knowledge.

Only one person limits the advice you get from experienced people. Asking a person that is not very experienced will not help as much than various people with experience. Even if only one person is very experienced, two experienced people will help more. Two minds are greater than one!

Listening to Multiple opinions for advice is important for advice. Only getting one opinion is not smart. Different opinions can help you make smart choices. Multiple people can give you different inputs that you can narrow down by yourself. Giving yourself options to choose from will help you make the better choice.

All of these reasons are reasons why people shouldnt just seek one person for advice. Receiving advice from various people with knowledge and experience is the best way to go. Listening to multiple opinions will help you choose the best option.
