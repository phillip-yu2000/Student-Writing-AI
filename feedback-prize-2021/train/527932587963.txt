My opinion on driverless cars are, that they are dangerous cause it may not be made right. Its can hurt other people on the rode if wheel spins out of control .Also there are careless drivers that may get the car and start txtin and want pay attention to the rode because it drives on its on. They seem very dangerous.

The article driverless says "none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless" there are many things wrong with this idea and can cost many life if not done correctly. The wheel may keep going while you trying to control it and may hurt someone or yourself if not used corrrectly. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still require a driver? This is how people think they may think because the car is now driving they dont need to do anything,Wrong that may hurt someone this is why that is dangerous. Also installing intertainment systems can very much distract the driver if you dnt want to driver why buy a car? That shows that our generation cant do anything for themseleves people are going to forget how to drive .
