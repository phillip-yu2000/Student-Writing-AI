A face on mars real or fake. The explaination for the human like face on mars is natural landform. It is natural landforming because in the artical it state the the human like face was fromed by shadow. " the caption noted a "huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head

. . . fromed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'' In my conclusion the alleged face on mars is from natural landforming. THn on April 5, 1998 Mars Orbiter Camera got a picture better the the Viking did. then it turned out it was a natural landform so in the end aliens did not create it. " And so on april 5, 1998, when

Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camara (MOC) team snapped a picture ten time sharper then the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. there was no alien monument after all.''
