The idea of a driverless car is a bad idea. A driverless car could not be able to make the same decisions as a human being can. If there was pothole you would like to miss, your car will hit it. If you were behind the wheel your car would probably miss it. What if something goes wrong in the wiring and the car swirves off the road for no reason while you might be asleep. It could put you in a position to where it could be not only you but also a passenger that maybe in your car at the time, in harms way.

The passage says, "Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident." Why go through the trouble to make new laws, when right now driving now is fun and something to do. A driverless car can not make the same decisions you make on a daily basis. A car will not know when to get gas or where to get gas. maybe some people might think of using the self-controlled car at night when you are so tired that you can't drive anymore because that is dangerous. If it comes to that point to where you would rather take your chances with the driverless car that is up to you.

Who would be at fault if there happened to be a wreck? What if both of the drivers were using the driverless car and it wasnt anybody behind the wheels fault. Would it be the drivers or the manufacturers fault? There could be so many things wrong with the driverless car. There could be wrecks, wiring issues, finding gas, and making human like decisions. A car made of metal can not make the same decisions as a human would and puts people behind the wheel of the driverless car in danger.
