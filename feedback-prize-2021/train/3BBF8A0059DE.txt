Dear, State Senator

We should change the election process for the president of the United States to the 'election by popular vote' method. This process is a lot more equal and very easy for the people.

The 'election by popular vote' method needs to become the newing presidential voting process for many reasons. When people vote today its not just the indivisual people voting its the indivisual states voting as a whole. Which in a way can cause confussion and unequality. The electoral college has many flaws inside its system, for instance ''under the electoral college system, voters do not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.'' But if you had the 'popular vote' method every single person that voted would have a personal vote that counted as 1. It is aggreable to sya that ''the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.''

Even though the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president. There are still at least two good reasons to keep it. One being that it ''restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states only ny populaton lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreeed in the Constituton.'' And the other being that the Electoral college avoids the problem of elections where no candidate receives a mojority of the votes cast.

In counterclaim of the good attributes of the electoral college voting system we could still state that the 'popular vote' method is still a much more equal, fair, accurate, and durable way of voting for the president of the United States.
