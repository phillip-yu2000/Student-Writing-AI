Dear Sir or Madame,

The world needs help. People can be a part of it, make a change; a difference. The environment is suffering. Trash needs to be picked up, old clothes need to be donated, flowers and trees need to be planted. I think that performing community service would be good for students. I believe it builds character. Serving soup, donating canned food items or unwanted toys takes nothing, but it means the world to people who aren't as fortunate as we are. Why waste space in your basement with all of your baby clothes or barbie dolls when you can make a little boy or girl happy? Reaching out and helping others is a good quality that young students need to practice. I guarantee that once a student has helped out, they'll keep doing it. Along with the feeling of satisfaction and pride that most people will take away from it, they'll also get to meet new people. This wouldn't just be helping the needy, it would also be helping these students who participate in volunteering. Community service should be required for all students. Even just ten minutes could do good and make someone smile. Change a life, volunteer.

Sincerely,
