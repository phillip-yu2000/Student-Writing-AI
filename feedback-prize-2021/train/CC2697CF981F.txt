Dear Principal Of SCHOOL_NAME,

I am student at SCHOOL_NAME and I believe that we should be allowed Policy 1. Policy 1 is allowing students to be able to use there phones for lunch and other free time. I think this because teens and kids these days have there phones on them (in there pocket or coat) 24/7! We love to text and calling people.

But I agree that we should not be allowed cell phones in class. When you are in a class room it is the teachers job to make sure you learn. Not to text or be on the phone with someone. But it is very hard to not be able to use you phone almost all day. We have breaks in school like lunch and advisory. I think we should be allowed to use them then. Lunch you are eating and talking to friends and sometimes you run out of subjects to talk about. So you could use your phone and text one of your friends from another school or a family member. It could be distracting during advisory because advisory is time to go see teachers if you have to retake a test, make up missing assignments and to get some of your homework done.

That may be a issue if a kid is behind because they probably be texting instead of getting there work done. But that may help kids if we were allowed cell phones during advisory to. Is you have all your work done, no missing assignments and no teachers you have to see then a reward could be able to use your phone. So kids now if they have all the requirements done they can us there phone. You would be allowed to have your phone out for all of lunch.

I believe that we should be allowed our cell phones at lunch and advisory under some conditions.

From,

A student at SCHOOL_NAME.
