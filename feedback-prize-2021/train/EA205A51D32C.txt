World War II was a terrible war, but fortunately, there is relief. Countries have united to form UNRAA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRAA hires Seagoing Cowboys to sail livestock to assist the population of the world in recovery. These are people who are more aware of people of other countires and their needs. The awareness stays with them. Here's why you should join.

First off, the adventure! You will sail across the world and visit many wonderful countries and their people in your quest to provide relief from a terrible disaster. It sounds like something right out of a storybook, doesn't it? Another reason is the sightseeing. You are provided with lots of freetime, so why not enjoy the beauty of both Mother Nature and mankind whilst you're on your journey. Maybe you'll get lucky and get to see the Panama Canal, or the temples of China. Also, wouldn't it be great to see the happy people and, most importantly, the children who you're going to help get back on their feet. Remember that warm, fuzzy feeling inside when you get doing something good? And if you like animals, and/or the ocean, you're going to want to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

In conclusion, the Seagoing Cowboys are great, generous people traveling a world which needs saving, for a multitude of reasons. Wouldn't you want be a hero, and climb into the ranks of the noble? And remember, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, so don't miss out on it. There's only so much people which need saving!
