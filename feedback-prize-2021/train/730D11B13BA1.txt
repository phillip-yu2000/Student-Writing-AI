Technology have go further, we have technology everywhere, from cameras to Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The FACS is a software that can read your emotions, it reads the muscles of your face, it creates a 3-D computer model of the face and reads the 44 major muscles in the face, the software can classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The FACS can be used in schools but it can have controversial problems, because some parents may not want a computer to read their childrens emotions, or they can think that is not a good thing that a computer can read your face and later they can use the picture of the face for other things, but some other parents may like the idea of using FACS in the school because they can know how their kids are feeling.

The pros about using that technology is that they can save the data and compare of how the students are feeling in the classroom and change the way of teaching, that can help the kids to not feel bored in class and they can enjoy it, other pro is that parents can see how their children are feeling and they can talk with them if they have issues or something is happen with their life and they don't want to tell them, in the article Dr. Huang predicts that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."

The cons might be that the the parents may not like the idea that a computer is reading the emotions of their kids, and the other con is they will not want to change the way of teaching because a computer said that the kids are bored or confuse, they might blame the teacher for not teaching the right way.

At my point of view is a good idea to use the FACS in the shools because the kids will not get bored if the school change the way of teaching and they will enjoy it, the other thing I like about the FACS is that the parents can know how their kids are feeling and they can talk with them, they can have more time together and be in time with the family, but now is your turn to decide what idea you like the most, you are with the pros or cons.
