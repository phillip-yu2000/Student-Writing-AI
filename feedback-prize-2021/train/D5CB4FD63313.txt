Would you be willing to join the exquisite Seagoing program? To help the many countaries that were in ruins,the 44 nations made the UNRRA.The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation, but our program is going to help them too. We have a myriad amount of exuberant people that are ready to explore the world. Our program takes you all around the world to help countries that don't have food, see beautiful sights you've never seen before, and to learn all about the places we'll go.

We will be like a spaceship zooming all over the world. We will be the altruistic people in the world ready to make our mark. The Seagoing Cowboy program is one of the best programs of all time. If you can't believe that, then I guess you better join the club then. Our club need to help so many people that are suffering.

Well, I guess you better be signing up now. You are allowed to sign up at any time. You are also welcome to take the bus we will be providing for people to ride on. I can't wait to go on the best trips, especially the trips that we can see what was left from Worl War II. We can put the remainings of World World II in a couple of mueseums. When we put the remainings in the muesuems, everybody can see what great deeds we did and then we can bring food and make food to the people that suffer.
