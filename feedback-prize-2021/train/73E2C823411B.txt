Why only seek one opinion when you can get multiple? People often go to more than one person for advice when they need an opinion. If you only seek advice from one person you might not be very confident in your choice. The more people you get advice from, the better choice you can make.

Although one persons opinion might feel like enough, its better to get many. One person might have a slightly bias opinion on a situation. They also might give advice they ends up helping themselves more than you. When you get more opinions it is a less likely chance that all the opinions will be bias.

Getting more than one piece of advice could also help you feel more confident when making a decision.

If you only get one persons advice then you likely will not feel very confident while making the decision and might not be happy with your decision later. If you get multiple opinions you can feel confident in your decision and not dread about how it might be a bad decision. Being confident in your decision will make you feel like you made the right choice.

Even if you get one bad opinion you do not agree with or think is a bad idea, it can help you see what choice you actually want and should make. When getting opinions you might be able to realize what you actually want and what would be the best decision. If you receive certain advice but do not like it, the opinion was still helpful to you because you can be more sure that you dont like that opinion and you like other opinions better. All together bad opinions also help with making good choices.

The more advice you receive the better choice you will end up making. More opinions will always help you feel more confident in your decision. Always seek more than one person for advice even if its not a major decision. Remember than all advice, whether good or bad, help you make the right decision.
