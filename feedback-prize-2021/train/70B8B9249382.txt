In World War 2, I was asked if I wanted to join thew UNRRA to become a seagoing cowboy. I believe that you and others should join because you maybe be helping your country and other countries. Also if you join it will help you in the long run by getting you special offers from other army groups and countries. If you could join would you, why or why not? I really think you should join because it is a really fun experince.

I have multiple reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys of the UNRRA. One reason you should join is that you could sightseeing while you are picking up the animals from the country ar in or on the way to other countries. Another reason you should join this program is when you turn 18 you could join other military services and other projects like this one. The thrid reason is the you get work with animals such as young cows, mules ,and horses. Final reason is that when you ngo from country to counrty you will go relaxz and have fun with your mates and you could final read that book you been wanting to read. Those are my reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

After all of these reasons would you want join the program. I am telling you it will do you some good later on in your life and you will love going aroundthe wolrd and explore. Oh and did I forget to teel you that you have you do an hourly check on the animals and you get to feed them. After all The trips you will be very grateful for the experince and opportunity to go acroos the world. Lastly You can do so much fun stuff on board after you are return from trips by doing stuff like fencing, boxing, table-ennis matches. and ithers games and activies. JOIN THE SEAGOING COWBOYS PROGRAM!!!
