Dear U.S Senate,

I think that we should abolish electoral colleges because over 60 percent of voters wants to do a direct vote. With the electoral college you cant do so because you have to vote for slate electors. This year people already expect a close election in which the popular vote winner can again lose. This electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in every state. The candidates on focus on the "swing" states. The electoral college is, unfair, outdated, and irrational. So

WE, US, YOU,

should abolish this electoral college and let we the people vote how we want to vote. Maybe just maybe the president we want to win so badly because we feel like he can can change up things for the better might actually win. If you take a survey over half of the states will tell you that we need to go back to the way we use to vote.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
