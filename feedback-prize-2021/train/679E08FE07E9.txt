Venus is well known to be one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. The author believes that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It may appear that Venus is the scecond planet from sun, its so to call Earth's twin, but although Venus is the second hottest planet. In despite of the conditions Venus may be worthy of pursuit.

Such like Earth, Venus is the closest in terms of density and size. Venus is a challenginhg planet for humans to study. As the authors states "humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land", but unfortunately no spacecraft has survived. It is believe that long ago, "...was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life". The author may believe that Venus isn't a lost cost.

However, Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,and it is believe that the average temperature is over 800 degrees. Even though Mercury is clsoer to our sun, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet. In these conditions Venus is a dangerous planet to study. Although the consequences the NASA has one idea to send humans to study Venus, "...allow scientists to float above the fray". The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. It may not be easy but are survivable for humans.

In conclusion Venus is an unstable planet to study, Venus may be worthy pursuit despite the dangers of the weather but it may possible to study it above the planet. The author also explains that NASA has a way to study the planet which may be useful but is it worth it?
