I think this would be helpful to use this technology to read students.

I agree on using this type of technology because you could tell how people and students are feeling. This is also helpful because it would be easier for teacher to help you out when your confused and having trouble with things when some students are to shy to ask for help. These classifieds 6 basic emotions of people like disgusted, happy, sad, fearful, angry, and surprise. Computers can even know if your happy or sad, some people don't really talk and mostly spend time on their computer so also for the computer to know if their happy or sad is helpful.

Finally this is helpful because people could be going through a hard time or has something that you don't know and you could even be helpful on telling them to talking it out and giving advices to them. This would make them fell better than usually.
