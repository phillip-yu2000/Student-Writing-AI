Many students love sports and put effort in to doing it, but when a school policy changes many students will argue to let people hear what they have to say. The principal wants to change the policy for students to participate in sports they have to have at least a grade B average. Many students have a grade C average, they are devastated for not being able to participate in sports. I'm going against on the policy change because i would be devastated too, if I could not participate in sports just because I have a grade C.

average. To support, I will bring to students to an assembly who admire sports and can not participate in them. Then, do a petition for participating in sports with a grade C average.

When my sister started sophomore year, she loved playing sports and doing all kinds of activity. Then suddenly her grades went down, she was so close not to participate in sports. She tried to raise her grades up, but she was stressed. Now, they still let her play unless she keeps her grades up. I want to bring students to an assembly and talk to them how much sports really mean to us. That grades and homework could be our number one priority. That we should still participate in sports with a grade C

average.

I would want to make a petition, so that students can support our cause and sign it. That its not fair that the things we love to do is being taken away. I think a lot of students and their parents would agree with me. Nothing could stop me from doing the petition. I wouldn't care what the principle or teacher would say. I would keep on pushing and pushing.

That's why I'm against the new policy change, because it wouldn't be fair for the student
