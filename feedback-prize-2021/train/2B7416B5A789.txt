Being a Seagoing Cowboy or Cowgirl is an experiance of a life time. I will never forget being Seagoing Cowboy. It opend up the world to me. It got me ready for life. I did things I didn't know I could do. I got to see amazing places and do amazing things. Even if I didn't have anything to do with the animals, me and my fellow cowboys played lot's of games and had tournaments.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy also made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. It made me realizie that I am helping lot's of people. I am helping people have food to eat. This awareness stayed with me, this led my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Some other people think it is dangerous to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I do think that sometimes it can be dangerous. That is why there are multiple people on the ship so they can help you when you get hurt, or can take over your job so you can heal.

My days as being a Seagoing Cowboy were amazing. I had lot's of fun and helped lot's of people. I hope that lot's of other people will have the same experiance that I had.
