Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I Think that students shouldn't be required to do community service. They should be allowed to choose whether or not they want to. Some students don't have enough time on their schedules to help out , because of sports or other extracurricular activities. A second reason would be because they already help out at home with younger siblings and their parents. Most of the time they barely have enough time to do their homework.

Students should be able to choose for themselves not have someone dictate what they do after or during school. The time it would take to do community service would be depriving students of their education. I don't think we need any uneducated generations to form. Isn't community service for those who have done wrong to the community anyways? Do you want people to think that we have a school filled with convicts, or juvenile delinquents?

I wouldn't want anyone to think that about my school. That is why i believe we shouldn't be required to do community service. We should have freedom to choose what we want to do, just like the constitution says " life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
