Exploring Venus is a worthy puruit despite the danger it presents because

"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."

This quote is important because there most likely would have been ways Venus could sustain some sort of life. If Venus really had oceans and ways of supporting life we can study Venus and maybe find out what happened to it to prevent it from happening to Earth. If we find a way to get to another planet and study it why wouldn't we?

In the third paragraph of the article it explains the harsh environment of Venus which should all be taken into consideration when thinking about Exploring Venus, and in five and seven it explains possible ways to safely explore and study Venus. Paragraph six explains how we cannot simply just orbit around Venus to study it because the gas and chaotic nature of the planet it too thick for cameras and any video to be taken so we would have to go to the surface and to do so we can use mechanical computers which can survive the harsh environment since it doesn't rely on electronics.

In conclusion Venus is the only planet in our solar system that is almost identical to us it could have had the ability to sustain life many years ago but now it's environment is extremely dangerous and any kind of research would be hard to do. There is a new idea to get to the surface of venus for more than a few hours and that is mechanical technology because of it's mechanical nature it can last longer than electronics on the surface which would give researchers a chance to study venus. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because before it was a chaotic planet with a dangerous environment it could have been just like Earth. Venus might have had oceans and because of the craters we have seen it could have also had mountains and different types of scenery.
