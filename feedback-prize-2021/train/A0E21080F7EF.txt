Dear Principal:

We know that you are going to make a hard decision right now but we urge to keep cell phones in school. Cell phones in school are necessary for many reasons. One of these reasons include that in case of an emergency students can call home for something. Taking cell phones away from students is like taking wings away from a bird.

In many occasions students have had to stay after school for some reason. Reasons for staying after school might be because your doing homework or using a computer or maybe just being with friends. The only way to stay after school without your parents worrying about why your not home yet or where you are is by you calling them with a cell phone during school.

If there is an emergency at school for example you fell or you feel bad and you need to go home the only way to contact your parents would be to call them and tell them what's happening and how your feeling is by a cell phone at school. Or maybe you forgot your homework so you have to call your house for someone to bring it.

Sometimes your at school and one of your parents calls you or texts you to remind you of something like a doctors appointment, or something tragic happened. The only way for you to know what is happening outside of school is for someone to either text you or call you for something important is by a cell phone. You would have to wait until you get home to hear the news if you don't have a cell phone in school.

So having cell phones in school is something that students need to have just in case of an emergency or something that you need to know right away. All students should be allowed to have cell phones in school. But if the student takes the cell phone out during class that would be different. Over all students need cell phones so do not take them away.
