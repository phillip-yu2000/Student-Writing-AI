The face on Mars was not made by aliens, and it only looked like a face because of the shadows. Michael Malin even took a better picture twenty two years later that showed it wasn't a face, but some people weren't satisfied. Three years later they took an even better one, showing that it wasn't a face at all.

This is not a face becasue the author says in paragraph two, "Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows" Some people didn't agree because "it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of the year" and to disprove this they took a better picture in the summer. In paragraph ten, it says "Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia"

the picture that he took was even clearer and it can be seen that nothing alien related is in the photo. It is all just a mesa.
