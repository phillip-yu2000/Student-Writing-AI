Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my opinion, I dont think the students would benefit taking classes at the comfort of their homes. That is because it's not the same thing as going to school. Taking classes at home is not the same as taking classes in school because in school you have a teacher that can help you, if you don't understand what's going on in the class. Also another reason is that in school you have a teacher that can teach the student actual lessons that the student can benefit from. Third reason is because sometimes you will just be lazy and not do the work and just do whatever you want since you're at home. No one will stop you, or give you remainders to do your work. Overall, I don't think the students would benefit from taking classes at their homes.

I would think that online classes would be harder and difficult to understand. In fact, being in a normal class you learn more and you are all catched up with your work. Being in school will help you communicate more with others, you can make or meet some new friends,the teacher will help you with some work if you need it. Online classes are harder because the student might not know what to do and he/she will be lost. Some people might find that online classes are hard and some might not it just depends on the individual. Some people just learn differently.

In conclusion everyone is different. What might work for you, might not work for the next person. Some people might benefit from talking online and some might not it. Honestly it just depends on what the students perfers online classes or school classes. I think that taking class in school is way better, teachers help you, you get better knowledge, you communicate more with others. Overall there is no right or wrong you just pick what you learn best and just do it.
