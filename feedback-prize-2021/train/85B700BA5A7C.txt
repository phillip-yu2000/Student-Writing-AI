Would you like it if your school principal would force you to do an extracurricular activity even though you dont want to. Im sure most students wouldnt mind staying after for an extracurricular activity, but for some students it could bother them, or could mess up how they are during classes because they haven't done their homeowrk because they weren't home to do it, or sometimes maybe at home because some students have to be home with their little siblings or helping their parrents at home ,and sometimes they can't becuase they are a school doing an activity.

Would you be upset if you have to stay for an extra activity? I certenly would be upset, and heres why. If my principal made me stay after school for an extra activity I would be upset beacuse I have to go home and take care of my little brother and little cousin. Also I have to help my mom around the house and if I stay after I can't help as much because i will be late and i will be at school do activitys at school, and im sure im not the only person that has to deal with that, and it can be very hard to work on both things at the same time.

If I were to stay afterschool to do activitys I feel like it would mess me up in some classes because i need to be doing homework or staying afterschool for a class, but if we don't have the extra activity I think we will be fine in our classes and our grades will be good. Another problem is that a lot of kids will be staying after school, and it could stress teachers out and might not want to help to stay afterschool.
