Dear principles,

i think that this is a good idea to do that because kids that are doing sports will keep them at a good grade. also it is a good idea to do that because it would give teachers a break.

doing that would get the kid to do better at there work so they would realize that if they don't get a good grade to play sports then they wont play. Parents are gong to get on there case about there grades and kid are gong to get all mad and actually kids and parents and teachers are going to have an easer work to do because the kid would do their work like the need to. Also i don't think it would be a good idea to do this because if the kid would give up and not try because the teacher or the principle will take them out of their sport.

I have both sides on this because it would work and not work at the same time.

i think lowering it down to a c- would work because that is the lowest it can get to an d. so this way students can play sports and have a good grade at the same time.

This would give schools a better chance at most of the students a good felling that they are doing a good job by getting to play in the next game. me personally i hade experienced this kind of feeling that keep me going to every game. and that was the greatest felling because i knew that i can do what other people said i cant do.

So it would be cool to see the whole team out on the field because they all have a good grade.
