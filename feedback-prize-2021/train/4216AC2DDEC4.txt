Most schools around the globe offer normal school, this is when a student goes to a class or classes to be taught. There is also online school which allows for students to get the same education at home over a computer or other device. The three reasons why online school is more beneficial to students are: it makes for a less stressful environment, students are responsible for his or her own work and grades, and allows students to have a more flexible schedule.

When a student goes to school they are taken out of their "safety bubble" and this can cause certain people to be more stressed. Most of the time stress can be good for a person. It helps keep a person awake and focus, it can cause a person to improve, among other things, but too much can be detrimental to a persons health, and cause that person to make mistakes.

In school some teachers have students work together on an assignment. This can cause problems because some students leave all the work to others causing the other students to have to do more work which may cause the overall grade to drop.

Students that have to go to normal school have to spend more than eight hours a day to go to school, finish school, and then do homework after they get home. this takes up more than half the day not leaving much time for anything else. If a student takes online school they can work at their own pace allowing them more time on what they need help with and less time on what they do not need help with.

Due to online school offering a less stress filled environment, students are responsible for his or her own work and grades, and allow students to have a more flexible schedule, show that the pros of online school outweigh the cons of online school.
