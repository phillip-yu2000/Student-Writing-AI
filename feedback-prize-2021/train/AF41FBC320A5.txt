dear principle lady i think students should not have to a b average to play sport teams because it would be fair for to the students that work everyday to average c and cant play, the kids that a students are not good at sports and they can make are school look bad at sports , and kids can be only good at that sport.

lebron james fly down court does 360 one hand to mahawk dunks the ball miami wins the game! miami wins the games! i think shouldn't have to b average because some student are only good at that sport .For example lebron james went stragiht from high school to the nba at the age 18 and lebron averaged a straights c's in high school and is becoming one of the greastest basket ball player EVER! but some studnets can average that c and if they don't get on the court they wont discover there talent.

one reason is if you let the students don't have talent on the team instead of letting students with talent play the school is going to suck and other schools are going to be laughting are school because we are acadimliy fit but not fitness we going are going to be a bad school to go to.
