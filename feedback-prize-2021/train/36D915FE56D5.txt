"all our developments since world war 2 has been centeres on the car". now we need to start limiting the car usage and start walking so people can get healthier. they can be less pollution in the air. people can save money instead of having to put gas or fix a problem the car has.

if we limit our car usage people would start walking wich is good. people are getting so used to cars that they have no excersise all they do is get in there car go to work and home wich is not good. if we limit the car usage all those people will have to walk wich would be better so they can have some type of excersise. if people needed to travel far distances they would have public transportation.

if we do limit the car usage there will be less pollution in the air. and if there is less pollution in the air there will be less congestion. there would be less smog in the air. where would be less people getting sick.

another advantage we will have is that people will be saving money. people wouldnt have to pay for gas. since people are walking they wouldnt have to pay for car insurance. people wont need to pay for car damages. and with all the money that people save most people wouldnt go in debt.

this are some reasons why i think we should limit car usage. now you write to inform our citizens why we should limit the car usage.
