Drivers should not use cellphones while driving a vehicle. People die every day from car wrecks because they are using cellphones.

I feel like drivers shouldn't use cellphones because you could be using a cellphone while driving on a highway, which can cause a car accident. When people use cellphones, they look down while driving, and they aren't looking at the road, so they can bump into another car and hurt themselves .If they are going to use a phone they need a hand free one so they can just talk instead of holding it I feel like they shouldn't use phones at all because what if they get an emergency call and it upsets them or drive them crazy, they can get weak and crash and lose their life. You should look at the road at all times.

If you're going to risk your life using a cellphone, I prefer you use a headset instead because you can still look at the road. The more car accidents we get, they come from using a cellphones. You can't handle a cellphone and a car at the same time, it's hard. Cell phones should get banned because of the amount of car accidents they cause. Imagine someone drunk and texting driving.

Cell phones are dangerous when you're not driving also. You can be walking with headphones in your ears and looking down texting, and a distracted driver comes and hit you. Your either going to be dead or scarred for life. Don't waste your life on a cellphone. It's not worth it.
