I am against the development of this car. A few things that I don`t like about it is that, It would cost alot of money, It may cause more wrecks then usual, and the fact it would make us even more lazy when we don`t drive.

First reason why I am against the development of this car is because of money. Some places there may not be enough money or room to even consider doing this project. Also, some people won`t do it because they want to drive, or feel comfortable driving their own car.

Second, it may cause many wrecks. The car itself may be fit and ready, but it may cause wrecks because of weather conditions or the car itself can`t control itself. I also believe people wouldn`t trust something like this. Yes, I have to admit that this car is cool, but many people will not agree to do this.

Third, it would make us even more lazy without walking or driving ourselves places. I think we should stay with driving ourselves for now, until they are 100% sure they`re ready for this and have enough money for it.
