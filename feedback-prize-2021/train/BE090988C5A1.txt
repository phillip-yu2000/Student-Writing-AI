In today's world mainly everyone we see has a phone or some kind of electronic device in their possession, now that's not a problem the problem is the fact that people will use these devices while driving, that distracts them from the road resulting in catastrophic consequences.

I believe people should not have their phone in their hands or looking at it while they drive because it distracts them from the road. The correlation between phone usage and accidents is 1.6 million crashes every year. Many people don't see it as such a bad thing or a something that is so important but in reality it is. When you stare at your phone for just second while driving that can cause you to not pay attention to anything that can happen around you.

It's okay for people to use them when they are parked in a safe place away from where people can get hurt such as a parking lot or a driveway but if you are at a red light and you start to use it that is just as dangerous as actually driving and looking down at it. No circumstance should allow for anyone to use their phones while driving unless they are an emergency response vehicle such as police firefighters or emt. I hope people see and realize the dangers of driving while texting and see that the lives of others around them are just as important because anything can change in a split second.

If some people don't see the big problem of texting and driving, then they shouldn't have a phone or be allowed to drive. Many people die every day because of this problem and none realize how bad this problem is in reality. People need to stop using phones while driving and start thinking about the safety and presence of others around them.
