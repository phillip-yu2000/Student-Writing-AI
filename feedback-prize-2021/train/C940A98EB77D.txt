In the artical "Driverless Cars Are Coming" they are talking about the negitaves and positives of the Driverless Cars.

I think driverless car are cool but are they all safe? One of my negitives is that the cars might malfuction and make you get in a accident and cause harm to the driver in the car, and if your just sitting there will the cars diving it will be a easy way for you to dose off and fall asleep, but in the section "Driving Or Assisting?" in parigraph eight they talk about they can put entertainment in to the driverless cars and have an heads up display and when its turn for the driver to take over it will instantly turn off for the driver to drive. Some of my positives of the driverless cars are that if you late for work but didn't have time to eat breakfast then you can eat it in the car while the driverless car is driving or you could do your hair if you had to rush and all you could do is shower and get dressed. Or you have to talk on the phone for work or something because if you dont have a blutooth then you can't really drive with the phone in your hand and and you could get pulled over and get a ticked.

but one more negitive is that people might take avantige of the driverless car and on the weekend go out and get jrunk the think it'ssafe because the car an drive by its self and the car could malfuntion and then get inaccident and when the cops come the person in the car will be the blaim because they were drunk then they will go to jail. so there gose my nigitives and positives of driverless cars .
