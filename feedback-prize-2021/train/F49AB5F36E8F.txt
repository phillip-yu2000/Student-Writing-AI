I disagree of this prompt by the principal as some of the students are not athletic to tryout for the sport teams. Some students are not able to learn faster than anybody else, or sometimes having trouble following instructions from teachers. The principal could of tried to put students at the best of what they could so if athletic student try to do a sport put them in football or basketball or a smart reader comes put them in a spelling bee it's all about what the students can do best. And sometime students dont wanna do anything so just let them do nothing cause theres a lot of kids in a school so there not affecting the school a lot. The yearbook club should be for the students who like taking pictures at home with they phone or watch a lot of photographers take pictures of other people living they life as they are taking pictures of other students for the yearbook club.

doing something for the school is not bad as other students might not to do the things that u want to them to do like i never seen a student that wanna work for the council and this is the reason i think this is a bad idea to do this is good if the students want to to them but its not as good as students want it.
