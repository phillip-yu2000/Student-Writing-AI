I feel, that when students are physically in class they will understand the subject they are trying to learn way better then attending online classes. I feel this way because, having a teacher or prophesier their to one on one help you is a great way to visually learn and hands on teach you. Everyone is different, some people are able to mentally solve problems or teach themselves a skill but others are not.

A lot of students like me struggle to finish a task without a teacher explaining it to me and showing me how its properly done. I feel this benefits you academically because a lot of teachers who provisional know the subjects will find ways to make the subject easier and less painful then it actually is. Teachers can also show you helpful techniques.

I also feel that when in class you can express your problems or concerns to someone who will most likely help you and understand. Although online classes give you a lot of free time its not very likely they will give you a second chance on a quiz or exam. Most teachers are willing to give their students second chances to retakes to help them get a passing grade.

Not all teachers do this but its definitely worth a try if you really need it. Some of the pros in attending class will improve your communication skills for the future expressing your concerns to your teacher shows that you have a voice and that you are entitled to your opinion. Having this skill will help you in the long run like at your job or youre future boss.

I

feel personally that attending class benefits you more then attending online classes but then again everyone is different everyone has their own pace this is my opinion.
