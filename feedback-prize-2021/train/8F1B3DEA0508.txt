Dear principle,

The cell phone use policy's have come to my attention.

Your students use their phones almost every period.

Your cell phone rule in place right now is not working. The kids get away with texting in class and it is distracting to their work which lowers their grades.

The policy in place right now is that your students can bring their phone to school,

but they have to have it turned off.

The kids use their phones anyway.

When you tell them not to use their phones,

they are going to use them anyway.

If you tell them they could use their phones at lunch and during their free time they will not use them as much,

during class.

Your students grades are dropping and it is because of the cell phone use during class.

Policy number two will be the best policy for your students.

It show them you trust them a lot more and if they need to call their parents that is the time to do it instead of going to the bathroom to call them.

Trust me, I'm a student.

Sincerely,

Your

Favorite

Student
