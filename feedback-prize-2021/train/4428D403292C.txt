I believe that the Face was a natural landform. Now in this esaay im going to state 2 reasons why I believe that it's a natural landform.

The first reason I believe this is because in papragraph 7 it says" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitin when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing....a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." This part of the prompt tells that alot of people wanted to know what the faces were and they found out that the faces were natural landforms. This sentence also shows that they went out and found that it was a natural landform. That is just one of the reasons why i believe that the faces are natural landforms.

The last reason I believe that they are natural landforms is in the 11th paragraph it says" As a rule of thumb, you can discern thigs in a digital image 3 times bigger tht the pixel size," he added. "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they are!" This paragraph tells how there was no way that with that camera they couldn't miss the fact that it was a natural landform. So, if there were alien prints they could see them with that camera though the lences.

Those are just some of the reasons why o believe that the faces are natural landforms.
