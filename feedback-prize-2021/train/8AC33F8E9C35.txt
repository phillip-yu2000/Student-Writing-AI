Driverless car`s In my opinion are a pretty smart idea for the people who lke to be on there phone while driving and risk theres and others life . Or a person who drinking and can get home safely cause he dont have to drive because the smart car will drive for him to get home. The smart car`s can lower the rate of deaths because of drunk drivers and people who text and drive . The smart car can also help with drives who slowly fall asleep at the wheel so they can take it easy but not fall asleep while driving because if the smart car is driving, but the human driver still has to be alert at all times because they may come across a road that takes human skill driving to go through like work site`s, accident`s,etc . In a negative way they can be a bad idea because what if there is a mechanical malfunction with the car itself like a problem that the owner of the car couldnt fix by hand because it had to be done by machines or experts then you wouldnt have a car for the time being . A driverless car still has to have human supervision because basically the human drivier still has to watch the road and watch for pedestrians , animals , and other objects or things going into the road . The smart car has positive and negative things towards it we dont know for sure if we should bring them into the world until the technology becomes even to where they can fix the negative things about them
