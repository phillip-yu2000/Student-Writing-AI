The surface of Mars is a great mystery to human kind, but the Face on Mars is just a coincidental human face resembling landform. The Face may resemble a human face, but there are also many other things that humans think are faces. One of these landforms that may look like a face is the face on the moon and even clouds can resemble faces. Therefore I believe that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform.

Although it may appear as a face to many people created by aliens, there has been no scientific proof that aliens exist. It's obvious that the Face on Mars is a peninsula or hill landform that may happen to look like a human face. If there was a peninsula or hill landform on Earth that happened to appear as a face, would everyone jump to the assumption of aliens? Then again there is no scientific evidence that aliens don't exist, but aliens are just made up science fiction creatures that people have come to believe are real.

Therefore the Face on Mars is just a peninsula or hill landform that coincidentally happens to appear as a human face. Just because it happens to look like a humans face and its in outer space people jump to the assumption that aliens are the reason behind the Face on Mars. The entire idea of aliens is just a joke humans made up to scare other humans. In conclusion, that is why I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform that happens to resemble a human face.
