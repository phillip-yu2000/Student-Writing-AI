Driverless cars are coming. Are we ready for driverless cars? Yes we are. Driverless cars alert us of danger. We still pay attention to the road. Also, we take full responsibility for any accidents, not the manufacturer.

Driverless cars come with lots of sensors that will alert us of danger. If you back out of the drive way, the car will alert you if something is in the way. The car goes the speed limit. It tells us when to take over the wheel. It is a safe car.

Just because the car drives itself, doesn't mean we don't pay attention to the road. The car has a camera watching us. If we crash they will see if it was our fault or not. There are also cameras on the outside of the car. We will have our eyes on the road at all times.

The car won't cause accidents, it would be us. Since the car has cameras in it we will know the truth. Now bad drivers won't be able to lie. They also can't say it was the cars fault. We watch the road and the car watches us.

I think driverless cars is a great idea. People are bad drivers. The car will alert us of danger. It will make sure we pay attention of the road. Especially since it has cameras in it for proof. Driverless cars is a great and safe idea.
