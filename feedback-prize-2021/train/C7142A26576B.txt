A mission of going to Venus is impossible for us, well atleast right now. In the future there is probably going to be a very high chance to visit the Earth like planet but right now, I don't see the possibilty of that happening. I think our focus should be exploring Mars, I think it's a more realistic mission. The author does have some good evidence to back up on why there's a possibility to explore Venus.

The author said that Venus is Earth's "twin" and that is true! Venus is the, "closest planet to Eartth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.". Venus probably had what Earth has right now which are oceans. Even now, Venus is similar to Earth in terms of surface. The planet has a rocky surface and sediment and also similar valleys, mountains, etc but it's not all good stuff about Venus, the planet also has enviroments that are not suitable for human life and I don't think it will anytime soon in my life time. The author does talk about it and gives facts on why it's hard to explore Venus. It has "A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide". The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the surface of Venus is a flaming 800+ degrees Fahrenheit. That's hot! The pressure alone is 90 times greater than Earth. A submarine accustomed to dive into our deep ocean would be crushed on the Venus surface. We won't be able to see through the thick clouds even if we hovered the planet. Therefore, it would be nearly impossible to et samples of anything!

After all, I think NASA and other private rocket organizations should just focus on going to Mars which like Venus, it's going to be hard. They should see it as a challenge which im sure they do but Mars should be our focus. The author gave good reasons on why we should and shouldn't explore Venus. Which ever planet gets explored first really won't matter. It's history being made for humans and that's what matters in my opinion.
