25 years ago, around Mars, a spacecraft from NASA was circling the planet.

It was taking pictures, until something strange happened. An enormous head appeared and seemed to be staring back at the camera.

A few scientists believed the Face, was made by an "alien." NASA has been discussing of what have may cause to make a face on Mars. We had millions of answers but didn't know which one was right.

Aliens did it. They are the ones who created the face! "Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact." First of all, no one knows for sure what have may of caused it. It could've been the atmosphere, or it could've been an "alien." Scientists thought it was probably a "Martian mesa", only this one almost looked like an "Egyptian Pharoh." You see, the shadow gave an "illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."

It was a good way to attract the public to the attention of Mars. "There was no alien monument after all."

Thousand of people wondered and were curious about the Face on Mars. "On April 8, 2001 , Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look." Close enough, they could predict what the image appeared. "So, if there were objects in this picyure like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!" The pictured showed landforms most common , and you could relate to Earth. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," said Garvin.

In conclusion, from 1976 to 2001, no one knows exactly what does the Face mean. The sensation was short.

NASA says it could've been a "huge rock formation..." It became a popular icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazine, radio talk shows." Some people think the Fcae is "bona fide" evidence life on Mars. BUt what do you think? Do you think it was made by an alien?

Do you believe that aliens do exisit? Well, were not sure . You see it coul be anything.
