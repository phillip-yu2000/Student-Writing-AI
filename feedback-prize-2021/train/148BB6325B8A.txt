Have you ever thought about people making driverless cars? People are trying to make driverless cars. I think it is a good idea to make driverless cars, but a lot of people think it is very dangerous. I think it is a good idea because, blind people can ride in driverless cars, it is easier to multi task especially when you have a kid, and when you are traveling far distances you can get a good break. Let me tell you more about the advantages of owning a driverless car.

One advantage of owning a driverless car is that a blind person can get from place to place in a driverless car. Usually a blind person would have to have a dog and a stick and walk. Blind people can get from place to place and easier with a driverless car. You can get from place to place faster with a driverless car, rather than walking everywhere.

The second advantage of owning a driverless car is that it is easier to multi task. When you have a kid or kids it would be great to have the car drive itself, so you can take care of your kids. When multi tasking you can sleep when going on road trips. You can also eat food while the car is taking you somewhere.

The last advantage of owning a driverless car is that you do not have to do anything. You can sleep the whole time and still get place to place. Or you can do what ever you want while in a car.

Personally, I would like the cars to be invented. In the passage the bad thing is when coming upon construction is that the car will tell you when to start driving manually. The other bad thing is that you have to have your hands on the wheel at all times. Other than that I would love to own a driverless car.
