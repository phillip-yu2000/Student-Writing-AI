To the principal the community service is a great idea in my position i think i would do community service. but in all school kids are always think the doing community service is just boring and some kids are just to lazy to do something for the community. when i think of a way to support our community i thing planting fruits, cleaning up the school, helping the needing. In my position i think community service is good because helping one of other is good.

Initially planting fruits are good you can get fresh fruit by this i mean the school can fresh fruit for schools and the community. The community can have fresher produces and have healthier school and the community breakfast, lunch, dinner. Additionally cleaning up the school is better for future and the kids can learn a lesson about helping is good thing and can help you to. You can help other by just helping the community. The community will be proud the people who help with everything. Helping the needing they are part the community to they are one of the part the need more help then other part of the community. You can help them by going to food drive and getting food for needing, by give them a meal , give money to a community the need it. I think by help the community you can be proud and i think the principal you give back to the people who help the community by doing a dance for the give back they did or dinner for the family for give back to the community. If you excuse me i going to go to my school to help with the planting fruit for my school.

off i go !
