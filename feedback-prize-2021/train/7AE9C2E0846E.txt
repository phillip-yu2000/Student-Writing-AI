We should only have to make a c in or classes it's not fair to put that on us, most of the athlete's have a c average in almost every class. I don't see why you would have to change that and try to make it better. I myself have a c grade point average and i think that it isn't fair to do that to us. I know you want all of your students to have high grades and what not but if your an athlete it's going to be harder for you because you won't have as much time as the people that are not playing sports. Think about it, we have practice and games that all end at about six or seven thirty. It's crazy ness. I want the grades to stay like this not just so it helps me but because it helps out every athlete. I want the athletes to have some space to work at school. I would not want to have to make at least a b average because it's not fair to all of the people that work so hard in sports and have little time for work to be done. It upsets me to know that you would even try to do such a thing. We have to work on sports 24/7 and it's just not enough time to have a b grade point average. The average should stay at c, because it's fair and if you can't get it done it's your own darn fault.
