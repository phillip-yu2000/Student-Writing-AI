This policy change is not going to work i say because students wont able to reach that level , but i believe they can but not everyone will and some will flunk and repeat. Also in order to pass and go to your next grade, you will need a C grade or higher. And i think it should be the same how you need a C on passing and it SHOULD be a C on letting us play sports or activities. I would consider if boys and girls need to play a sport and get involve in activities in school , i would like to prefer them to have a C grade or higher . No lower than a C than that person may not play a sport or get involved in that activity. I would Prefer them to get a C or higher because to me a C is a passing grade and every student have different strengths and they have weak stuff. Also because it is not fair to the people that doesn't know that thing the teacher is teaching. Some students learn fast and some don't. But as long as they are paying attention in class too and not playing around and making bad choices .This is fair and a great way to have people have a C or higher to attend any activities or sports in school.

To me i think a B average is unfair because some people cant reach that level , all of us are different . But as long as we Get a C grade or higher that would be better and fair .
