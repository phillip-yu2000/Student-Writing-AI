Dear principal,

I think that you should think about letting the children have there phones in school. it would help reduce all the students having them out during classes and reduce the amount of phones taken each day. This would give more class time instead of worrying about kids having phones out.

If students were allowed to have phones out during lunch periods and free times then that would give them time to call and check up on loved ones such as moms dads and other family members. This would help students keep up on school work by setting reminders on there cell phones to remind them when an assignment is due. Teachers could collect phones when it is time for there class to start to prevent kids from using them in or during class time.

So please Mrs. Principal think over policy 1 for our fellow student body we the students my really listen to the rules about our phones and when and where we may have them. Mrs. principal take into consideration for your fellow students.

Sincerely,

Your student
