In our modern age, cars have become one of the most widespread means of transportation in our world. They can provide reliable transportation from one place to another, but we could benefit greatly from limiting our drastic use of motorized vehicles.

While cars maintain their status as one of the largest transportation mediums, they are also beginning to rival powerplants in their emissions of greenhouse gases. For example, in America and many EU countries, Motorized vehicles are second in to powerplants in greenhouse gas emissions.

Now, since greenhouse gases are contributing to global warming, and cars are a major contributor to those emissions, it would be beneficial to cut down on our usage of them. In Paris, smog levels had reached such a dramatic level that the government placed a partial ban on motorized vehicles to cut down car emissions. In the suburbs of an experimental community of Vauban, Germany, 70% of residents do not own cars as a result of there being no roadways save on the outskirts that lead to the downtown area.
