My position on driverless cars is that we should wait until they are more efficient. When you still have to take control when you get to certain obsticles i don't think there is a point. The reason i want a driverless car is so i can sleep while im being drivin. When you still have to pay attention and be ready to take control it seems kind of useless.

I am all for the use and development of these driverless cars but not until they can figure out how to make it work better. If Tesla creates the car they say they are then what happens when you are asleep and a drunk or reckless driver crashes into you. Will they have a way for the car to react to instantanious situations. I wouldn't feel safe enough in a driverless car, at least not until the majority of the population has one.

If everyone had a driverless car, then you wouldn't have to be as worried about being killed by a drunk or reckless driver. The car might be able to recognise a dangerous situation but if the other car is traveling fast enough will you be able to react in time. These are the only concerns i have with driverless cars and im excited for the time i can get and my car and sleep while it takes me to places. So i am for driverless cars if they are proven to be somewhat safe because i trust myself more than a car.
