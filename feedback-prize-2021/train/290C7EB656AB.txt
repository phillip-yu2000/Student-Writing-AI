To the Principal,

I think that community service should be performed out of school in your own time because the school should be teaching academics and not giving back to the community. Community service should be an individuals choice, not a forced unpaid job because the people that do community service usually want to and would do a better job than the people who don't care or want to do it.

In school, I believe that the students should perform a few hours or the minimum requirement just to give them the idea of community service. Academics are far more important in my eyes than almost anything else in school. And taking that time away would lessen the time they get to learn about academics. If anything, the parents of the student should introduce community service to the student and even they shouldn't force them do it either.

Don't get me wrong, I think community service is a necessity. Recreation coaches, people who clean up litter, and referees are all unpaid people who give up their free time to help their community. but they are not forced to give up their time. People who don't want to do community service shouldn't have to.

Well it is your choice to make community service necessary in school, and I hope I persuaded you otherwise.
