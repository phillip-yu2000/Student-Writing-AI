In the article the author describes a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions and tell people what that person is feeling.

The Facial Action Coding System should be used to read students' emotional expressions because it could help them with their work if they do not inderstand something and the teacher cannot make it any easier for the student.

While others think that this new technology is a bad idea, others think it is a good idea. The text states, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This proves that this technology could help students with their school work if they did not understand it.

Others say that the new technology coul dbe used to make computer animated characters more expressive. The article states, "The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-- for video games and for video surgery." This proves that this technology can make people happier by just making others smile.

The Facial Action Coding System should be allowed in school and other public places. It would help people understand what everyone else is feeling and if they need someone to comfort them. The new technology should be allowed to make others around them happier then they were earlier. It will make everyone's life easiler because then they will not have to hold in their feelings and they can just talk to the people they feel they can trust.
