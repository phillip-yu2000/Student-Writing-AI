Dear Principal

I think we should help with community service, because it makes our town a better place. People could help by recycling, cleaning up our lake or picking up the trash on the sides of the roads and at the parks.

people should recycle because it gets rid of all the plastic waste that could harm the animals in their ecosystem that they survive in, and it just makes the world a better place in general.

cleaning up our lake is another good way to help our community factories should not put waste products in the fresh water that we use in our every day lives it can harm the animals and most importantly us, by getting rid of all the trash think of how much more prettier the lake would be no one wants to go see a trashy lake and then later get a drink of water and think wait this may of had tons of trash in it gross.

Getting rid of trash in the parks and roads are also good for the town it makes us look like a town who cares about what they look like.

there should be schedules saying who cleans where, when, and how long so its not just one person doing all the work and every on taking the credit , and that would eliminate arguments over who cleaned more.

i would recommend community service for our school.
