I agree with the principal, because doing an extracurricular actives can benefit kids in many ways. One way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is by playing a sport it can teach them many things. Another way doing an extracurricular activity could benefit kids is join a student council is can teach kids how to use their voice. Last way is join any club.

A way join a sport could benefit kids is it can show kids what its like to be on a team. That can help them to get a job or if they already have one it can help them during their job. Another way playing a sport can benefit kids it can teach them how to work on a team and how to work well with others.

Another way how extracurricular act ivies could benefit kids is serving on student council it can help kids speak up or fight for what's or to make things equal. That can benefit kids in many ways, such as if while working a job you think something is not be treated right or if someone is not being treated equally you can speak up for what's right.

Last way joing an extracurricular activity could benfit kids is by joing a a club. Joing a club could help them interact with more people. Learning how to interact with people can help kids later on life, during a job, in school, or even in public.

In concluison joining an extracurricualr activity could help kids in many more ways then the ones sated above. Playing a sport could benfit kids by teaching them how to work togeter. Serving on a student conciual could help kids use their voice and fight for whats right. Last way is by joing a club it could help kids interact with people. You should join an extracurricular to see what could happen.
