Dear Principle,

I think it is important you do so. People with an C or lower in their grades should focus more on working to get their grades up, because in sports they will only use up very needed time they could be studying or doing very important homework at home for sports. It needs to be done there are lots and lots of people failing, not being able to go to college, or losing their jobs. Education is way more important than sports. If they have a B or higher let them take sports.

Think of how many people do sports more than homework. When they could be doing homework their at a game when their grades are low. They don't realize what their doing to their selves, they are smashing their grades down lower if they can't focus. Without sports for them to do they will focus more on their grades, and that is what we need.

People are failing their classes and staying in the same grade. If you cut sports off the people who have as low as a C in their grades they won't fail. And think of people not being able to go to college with a great education, you need to cut it off it will make them better and they will be ready. So cut out the sports on people that have really low grades so they succeed in life.

So help out the kids that do sports and are close to failing and don't make them fail. Please help them for better life.
