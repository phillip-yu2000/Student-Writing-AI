Dear Principle,

I believe that students should be able to have their phones during school. I think that phones are a nice resource to have. Although students are allowed to have their phones you could put restrictions on when they are allowed to be used. You could tell students that they are only allowed to be used during free times and not classes. If you find a student using their phone during class you could take it away.

I think letting them use their phones would resist them from the temptations to hide using it. Whether they are allowed to or not they will still use their phones. They will just hide the fact that they are using them. If you don't let them use their phones. It would make it less cool to use their phone because everyone will be using them but if you say that they can't then they will just be more rebellious and try to use it without your knowledge. You could make consequences for misusing your phone.

Our phones are a good source of communication and something that we should take advantage of. It makes communicating with your parents much easier and quicker. Instead of going through assistants or teacher for parents to talk to their students they could just contact them. It is also a good way for students to find each other. If they are working on a project together it makes it easier for them to get in contact to talk or find each other. I think that the pros are greater than the cons and in either one of these policies their will be issues but they can be worked on.

Sincerely,
