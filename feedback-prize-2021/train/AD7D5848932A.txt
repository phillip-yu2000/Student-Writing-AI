I belive that others should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. For a reason we all know to help other countries.

One reason that I belive that others should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because while your helping our country you can be enjoying sight seeing at the same time. You can see Panama Canal, Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy a city with streets of water, a excavated castle in Crete, and so much more. You can still have fun after the animals have been unloaded. You and your crew can play baseball and volleyballl games in empty holds where animals have been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, whittiling, games, and even reading can help pass time on your way back.

People might say that if you slip you can fall out if doing midnight rounds. Well, with the technologhy we have today you won't be as likely to slip and fall out of the boat. People might aslo say the that what if people attack you on the boat while sailing. You would be able to protect the animals and you because the U.S. wouldn't send you without any protection. You would most likely have guns or othe ships following you. Also, most likely no one will attack you while you are trying to get animals or help a country.

I belive that other people should join the Seagoing Cowboy programs because you can see historical sights, you can have fun after the animals get off, and a huge thing is that you are helping other countries.
