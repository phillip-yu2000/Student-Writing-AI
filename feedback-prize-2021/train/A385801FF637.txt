Dear principal,

I am writing to you to tell you that you should consider letting students bring their phones to school, but have them turn them off during class because students should have the rights to be able to contact a parent at all times. Students could also be stress free for the teachers because they wouldn't be as loud at lunch or in the halls. It could also help the teachers because if a student is not in class another student could call or text these students to figure out if they are sick and if not where they are, and another student could leave their phone on so the absent student can hear and still participate in the class activities so they wouldn't be so far behind when they return.

Students should be able to contact a parent at all times. If an emergency were to take place they would have an easier way to find out. This could also help because if student isn't doing what they are supposed to do they can call their parents and tell them why they aren't doing the work or behaving the way they should.

If student had their phones with them at lunch then everyone would be texting instead of talking to each other so it wouldn't be loud because texting requires no talking, and the teachers could sit and enjoy their lunch in peace and quiet.

If another student is absent and someone has their phone they can contact them and figure out where they are and see if they are ok. Then someone can call them and leave their phone on so that student can still participate in the class lessons still.

So if students had their phones it would make school have more fun and still help with the students education.

sincerely,

your well accomplishes students
