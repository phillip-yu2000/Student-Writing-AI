I could see how someone could think that theres some kind of aliens living on Mars and thats what created this human face looking thing. there are more reasonable explantions, then the aliens. This rock formation is actually very comman in mars.

This is a natural formation that happens on Mars. it is very similiar to a formation we have on earth. It was very difficult to figure this out, but thanks to the the new technology we have today we can have better images, and a better understanding of what this is. We have gotten very good answers and clear evidence, even with the difficulties to finding this formation.

It is a more solid, and proven answer to this rock formation. most theories people have created ,dont have good backup infromation in thier statements. In conclusion there are many good reason to why someone could say that alien could of done this, but with the proper equipment we can find out the more reliable answer to this kind of situations.
