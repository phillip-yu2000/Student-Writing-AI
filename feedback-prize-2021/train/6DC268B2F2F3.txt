Dear Principal,

Have you ever wondered what would happen if there was a fire or a tragedy during school? If one was to happen wouldn't you want students to be able to call for help? If you put policy one in our school you would never have to worry about hat again. In fact, if you bring policy one into our school you would have students would pay more attention in class, students being able to call their parents if something was wrong, and if a student forgot something they could call someone.

When students are in school it is totally different than being at home. When we are at home we text our friends and are always on our phones, but when we come to school we have to turn our phones off and not use them. Students are always tempted to text during class so if you let us text during lunch it relives that temptation. Policy one would help us so that is why it is a good idea.

If there was a tragedy during school and a student was hurt and you couldn't hear them what would help them? A cell phone because they could call for help to save them. If a student did not have the cell phone then they may have no way to call for help. I think policy one would help you so that no one would get hurt.

If you are in class about to go to a different class and remember that you forgot something at home that you needed you could call a parent during lunch to get them to bring it and not get a bad grade. If you have policy one that would happen. I think that if you had policy two then you would have worse grades and have a higher drop out rate. You do not want that, do you?

All in all, i think that it would be beneficial to you if you had policy one not two. you should seriously consider using policy one. Policy one is thee better choice and it would be better for students.

Sincerely,
