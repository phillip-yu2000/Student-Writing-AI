The Facial Action Coding System is very valuable for classrooms because if it is able to tell if students are confused or bored it could help students learn better and make school better for them. The system can check and see if the student's face muscles are a certain way which lets the system know how the student is feeling at that point. It describes Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona Lisa as "83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."

The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track the facial movements. Dr. Huang's new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, and then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor." It says that "Your regular home PC couldn't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."

The Facial Action Coding System can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a real smile. To tell if it is a genuine smile it says "the zygomatic majors lift the corners of your mouth, and meanwhile, the muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes." This could be very helpful in a classroom to tell if students need help or if they need some more things to do if they are bored.
