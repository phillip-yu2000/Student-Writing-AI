Some schools offer distance learning as and option for students to attend classes from home by way of online video conferencing ,Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? There are too many ways to appreciate the opportunity to take online classes ,at my point of view this is a good tool to people who's not able to attend to a regular school or for people who needs more credits to graduated .Some people attend to take online classes because they don't have enough time to attend to a regular school because they have to work in the morning to support a family, take classes online is the best way to get a career ,and get a better job. This tools would benefits people ,I have my own example that take classes online is really helpful to graduate because ,I am taking classes online because i need credits to graduate and it is a good opportunity that some schools offer to students in the same way as me .one of the advantage at being taking classes at home is that you can work and study at the same time ,and you can have your own schedule and the best thing is at home you dont have to travel to other place

. When you are taking online classes you are allow to work whenever you want

,and also you can eating at the same time because you dont have nobody to pressure you to do the assignment because you have the enough time

.

However there also some disadvantage of take online classes because sometimes the students don't use this opportunity from the best way .One disadvantage is that some students when they are taking online classes they can uses the phone and those devices distract them so much,Sometimes they don't have nobody to help them if have any question or needs help with something . One more disadvantage is that when the students are taking classes online they attend to loss interest and prefers do other things instead of do their assignments

,because they don't even care about their grades because they don't have a teacher to pressure them to do their assignments ,but everything depends how much interest the student put in pass the online classes to improve the grades and gained more knowledge .Sometimes when the students take online classes and regular school they attend to violated the rules of the school because they are accustomed to be in the habit of work at home they dont want to follow the directions of the teacher, and they also what to do whatever they want and that is not fear for the teacher who has to tolerate it.

There are some advantages and disadvantage of attend classes from home by online classes ,but everything depends the way that you uses this tools to gained more knowledge and be prepared for life .
