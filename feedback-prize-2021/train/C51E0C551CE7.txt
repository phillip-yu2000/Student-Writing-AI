From reading the passage, "Driverless Cars Are Coming," I disagree from the idea of creating a car that will transport people without the need of a driver.

Why I strongly disagree with the thought of this idea is simply because something bad could go very wrong. Have you asked yourself, "what if a car was built wrong?" In that case, the car wouldn't work right and no one would even know. Just because it was designed to go from one destination to the next doesn't mean something could go wrong. Then the passengers in the car could get severely hurt. Passengers wouldn't be able to take over the car and avoid an accident. When reading the passage, the narrator talks about cars and how cars need the driver just in case there's an incident on the road, and only the driver would know how to get around that.

This is one out of many reasons why i think driverless cars shouldn't be created.
