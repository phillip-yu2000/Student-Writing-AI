Electoral College method should not be kept because it gives larger states a bigger adventege and is unfair to voters. Even though it can be argued that the Electoral College method should be kept due to avioding problems of a run-off in a election.

The Electoral College consits of electoral votes that each states recieves due to the population of the state. This gives larger states like California having 55 electoral votes to have a bigger say in the election. Meanwhile states with a less population rate like Alaska only have 3 electoral votes. This turns off voters because they know that their state isn't a big deal in a election. Candidates go for the electoral votes of the bigger states with the most population to win the election.

The Electoral College is a method that is unfair to voters. The winner take all system in each states makes candidates or even voters not want to spend their time on current states they know will not have a impact in the election. It ends up being the electors who elect the president, and not the people. The Electoral College method is not democratic in that perspective.

The Electoral College is a lack of democratic pedigree and unfair to voters, it is impacting votes due to electoral votes being in power over the people. Due to the Electoral College method turning off voters it should not be kept.
