Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There are many students that help the community and some that doesn't do anything. I think that students should be required to perform community service. Right now, there has been some crises about the ice melting and polar bears going extinct at the North and South pole. We shouldn't be hurting the Earth but protecting it. Try to imagine the world full of trash and people who don't care about that. One way to prevent that from happening is by doing community service. If each person does at least about 5-7 hours of community service, it can definitely change the result. There are many people out there trying to do their best to protect it but there's more people that either trash the Earth or just think that other people would do it. All the students should try to help so that the children in the future could have a clean environment to live in.

Tutoring students can be community service. We can teach them how to protect the Earth instead of trashing it. As students learn more, they would be smart to understand what the other people that helps are going through. We have to show good examples so they can follow it and spread the word out so others may join.

I do a lot of community service. Every once a month, I join a group that helps the Earth. We go to parks, events, and places where many people go to and pick up trash for 3 hours. I can't imagine how much trash there was. There were much more trash than I expected. Cups, plastics, boxes were everywhere and not the in trash can. Also, I tutor 2 kids every Saturdays for about 2 hours. I teach them every subject and also how to encourage others to clean the environment they live in. So in the future, they can set good examples to other kids at their schools. It may be hard but I'm glad to help out.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
