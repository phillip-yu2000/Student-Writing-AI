I think it would be great if students could use cell phones at school, although parents are probably not crazy about this idea. I don't see a problem if the students are just using them at lunch and in their free time, while their not doing an assignment in class. If teachers and parents think using them in lunch is a big deal well, I don't see an issue. There would be no way for us students, to cheat or text each other the answer to a question. But I do think if a teacher does catch us using them while we're supposed to be doing an assignment, we should get in trouble. Not a lot of trouble, just a warning unless they've done it before. If teachers would let us go through with this rule, we wouldn't take advantage of it. We would very much respect all the teachers, just for allowing us to take them out in school. I know for a fact I'd appreciate it so very much, and follow the new rules. I at least think teachers should let us try this new suggestion out for a few years, and if it gets out of hand, your more than welcome to band cell phones on school grounds, but for some reason i think this would make students a lot happier to be at school, rather than dreading it like most of us. I'm not going to beg, but I don't think you would regret letting us use them, if not in our class period, then only in lunch and on field trips.
