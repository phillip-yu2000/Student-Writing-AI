It is a better choice asking more than one person because when you ask them what's your problem or question most of them are going to say something else while some are just going to say the same thing. But it's not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person. Because that person might be wrong and not know ask your examples:mom,dad,ant,uncle your friends anyone you trust and thats how you get multiple opinions and when your making a better choice by asking anyone you know. But don't ask one person cause one that person might not know and two it's not a better choice by asking only one person and sometimes you might not trust that one person by his or it's idea. And you might get your problem or question answered by asking multiple of people. Conclusion that you should ask more than one person so you can get more multiple opinions and you might get the right answer of your problem or question by the right person. But some people don't like telling other people there question or problem one cause there scared or shy or they might think that the person will not know or understand what the person is talking about that sometimes can happened it happen to my friend once where he had a math question asked the teacher but the teacher didn't know what he meant or what he was talking about so the teacher tryed to tell him his question but that wasnt the question my friend ask for so he told a student that sits next to him and he understanded what he was talking about so he then helped him with the question he had.
