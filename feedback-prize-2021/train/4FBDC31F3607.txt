F.A.C.S would be a valuable reasourse to read the emotions of students in a classroom, but over all useless and waste of resources. The abillity to read the emotions of a student and change the style of teaching is interesting, but if somthing is changed other students may find it boreing. Every student has different emotions and you cannot change the lesson to fit that one student is is bored, because another student may become bored with the change. The variation of emotion in students is uncontrolled and how someone feels can change in seconds. F.A.C.S is interesting, but not needed in school and classrooms.

Many students don't care about school and will ingnore the change in the lesson like Dr. Huang is talking about. The article also never states how the class would be monitored. Its also never stated how long the scan will take, the scan of emotion could take up class time if the scan needed to be infront of a computer. Its also a school where you learn, not a safeplace where when you feel sad the teach knows and tries to cheer you up. Teachers don't need to know student emotions and shouldn't care they are there to teach.

F.A.C.S is interesting with the way it forms 3D models of a face to identify emotions. The way F.A.C.S can put your emotions into percents in extrordinary and very amazing. The use for it in classrooms is unneeded on the other hand. The change in emotions in students is to frequent for the system to help the teacher change teaching methods in the middle of class. Some people just don't like school and wouldn't care what changes the system may help suggest. There are too many factors for F.A.C.S to run smoothly and be a help. Classrooms do not need F.A.C.S.
