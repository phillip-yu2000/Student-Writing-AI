I think Policy 1 is better because some parents let their children have phones for certain reasons. For example, they may need it for emergencies, like to call their parents or other family members if they are sick or suspended and they have to go home immediately, , or they get in trouble. I think we should be able to use our phones during lunch periods and other free times because we are not doing anything, we are not doing any work, and we are also not disturbing anybody. But the phones should be turned off during class because when they receive a text message or a phone call , it distracts them from learning and listening to what the teacher is saying because they want to check it and if the teacher see the phone out they are going to want to take it and make your parents come get it or they can hold it until the end of the class. So i agree with Policy 1.
