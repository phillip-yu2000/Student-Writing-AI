Summer projects should be student-designed. No student likes to do projects in the summer, Students will require motivation and excitement. If students can design their own project, they can be different and more creative. Students enjoy tasks where there's no limit as to what they can do; it gives them the opportunity to try something new. This gives teachers less work and students a more thoughtful tasks. Overall, this will give students a reason to learn, even during they're break.

This is a good way to assure students are still learning. It also gives the students more of a challenge and prepare them for the following school year. Students can use this as a way to see how they're doing and also to stay involved in school. If it were a teacher-designed project, most students wouldnt participate. Since the students are the ones designing it, it'll give them a little more excitement and control over the project.

Students tend to work harder and be more creative when it is a self-designed project. This will open more opportunities and more ideas. Designing your own project gives students the freedom and control that they love. For example, the few times I've been able to design my own project I always put forth more effort and creativity; This is because students love to try different things and be in control. This is important because it teaches students valuable skills that they may need in the real world.

If students are interested and have ideas, summer projects can be really beneficial. Allowing students to create their own project is a great way to interest them. Students tend to work best when they have their own ideas, it's a lot easier and gives the student more freedom. This can teach students to be more independent and hardworking.

A project can show effort and knowledge, when students create their own it shows their best work. It allows students to show what they are capable of. That is why I believe students should design their own project.
