There are many schools who assign projects over the summer. Assignments can range from a large packet of math to an even larger packet on earth science. These packets are generally designed by teachers, but what if students designed them instead? If students designed these projects, then they would be more interesting than a packet with a hundred problems to be answered. If students design assignments for their peers then they'll be far less boring and more likely to get done.

In the classroom, students will listen to their teachers ramble on, and not truly hear a word they say. What these instructors are saying isn't really catching the student's attention, it's boring them. But if their interests were taken into consideration when making projects then they would become more involved. The same goes for summer projects. If the teenager's assignments are based on things they don't care about, they won't do them, but someone of the same age comes in, then they can pinpoint the teenager's interests easier.

Now that the assignment has caught the attention of the student, the student is far more likely to get it done. The urge to procrastinate will not be there as much because it is an interesting way to learn more. They don't feel pressured into doing the assignment and are not as stressed by the idea of having to tackle another assignment.

Some would say that it is not a good idea to allow students to create these assignments because they'll make them to easy or won't really try when they make it. But students are just as capable as the teachers when it comes to helping out their peers and getting these summer projects done. In short, if the students design the summer projects it would turn out better. So, if students do end up designing these projects, then they will take into consideration the students interests and make the projects better for the student then they'll get done much easier.
