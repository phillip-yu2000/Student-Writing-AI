Many people ask for different opinions when asking for advice, but do you ever wonder why? Well first off you could get many ideas from so many different people. However, getting so many opinions could confuse you because you would have too many opinions from people and you wont know which one to pick. You could start off by picking your favorite advises and asking people which one is the best out of all of them. Dont stress about it even is its confusing you. After picking the opinion you like the most just go with it and dont think about it anymore.

A lot of people tend to not be so sure of what they think so they go for peoples advises. The reason for that is because they are just insecure of what they think. People think what they think isn't good enough so they go for more advises. Sometimes they think they will make the wrong decision from what the people think. There are so many reasons why people go to different people for advice.

People in general may have the same opinion so you know which one would be the best one. I go for advice a lot, because i feel like my choice isn't as good as others. Others may think the same way or they just might feel like they just generally need someones opinion at the moment. Therefore, its good to go for advice because it would actually help you with what your needing at the moment, and it could help you communicate because your asking people advice.
