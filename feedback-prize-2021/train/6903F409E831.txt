Dear Principal,

You are considering changing the school policy so only students with a grade B average or higher can participate in sports. I believe this is a good idea. Students should have to prove they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with participating in school hosted sports or activities. If you agree to this new policy, many students already participating in the sport or activity will improve their grades to stay in the group. Changing the school's policy would prove that the school keeps standards high and that you give back to students who make good grades.

Students need to be able to prove that they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with sports or clubs to join. Clubs and sports are extra-curricular activities and to join, you should not be failing any core class assigned to you by your school. Many groups a school will host are for providing a comfortable environment where you can make friends and learn something new, but not being able to learn what is necessary before hand proves you should not learn new information. Students should need to prove that they can pass a class to be rewarded with clubs and other activities to participate in.

Activating this new policy would force any students without a B average to work harder or stop participating in the activity. If you enforced this new policy, you would notice all the passing students and give them credit for all the excellent work they have produced. Any and all students, if they really cared about the activity, would try harder to keep or raise their standards, thus producing better grades. Activating this new policy is a great way to show the students what they are capable of doing and how to get there if they keep their grades high.

I believe this idea for making it a rule that having good grades will get you into sports activities is a fantastic idea and strongly hope that you apply it to our school. Many students would ttry harder and that is what school is al
