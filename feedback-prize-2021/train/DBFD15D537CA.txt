It's better to ask multiple people because you can get the best answer for what your looking for. To ask for advice you will need more then one persons thoughts on what the subject is to make the best choose. It's better to take more answers then one so you can make the best choose.

When someone is making a big life chose you will probably need to hear peoples options.
