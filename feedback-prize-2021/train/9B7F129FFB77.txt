Dear Principal,

I think that you should allow cell phones in school because they can be very useful. During free time cell phones can be used to communicate with friends from other schools. This makes it easier for teenagers to communicate with friends and not lose friendships. They can be used to talk to other students and keep up with their homework.

They can be used in emergency situations. An example could be if a student forgot his or her lunch they could call their guardian and tell them to bring lunch to school. Or if a student is seriously hurt they could call an ambulance to help them. Cell phones can help students stay out of trouble and become a better students. Students could help each other by texting notes during lunch or in the morning if a notebook is forgotten.

Cell phone can cut down on weight students have to carry because of books by texting assignments. Cell phones can also help students remember things like tests or homework. Teens could also call a friends parents for a ride home or to stay at their friends home to study. Cell phone can be a very useful tool if used properly.

Your's Truly,
