There is different opions about technology used in class, some people may be agree and some people may be disagree. Sometime we dont understand how easy can be life if we lmprove our technology, in this case there is a program that reads emotional expressions, if we allow this technology into classrooms it can help use to figure out many problems, for example, when someone is sad, or it's really worry about something,or even when we distracted. Most of the times we stay quietbecause we scare of what other people will say, but sometimes it would be good to let others know so they can help us and prevent from bad things to occur.

It would be good to use this type of techonlogy in a classrrom because the teacher will notice when his class is gettting bored and is learning less, so the teacher can improve something to do better and make his student to pay attention and learn more. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." Most of the times when a student is bored in class is because he does not like his class, and whyhe does not like his class? probably he dont understand well, and the student needs help, so if the teacher would have this technology they will know what is happening, and they can try to fix this problem, either making his class more interesting,explain more, staying more time, or working after school. The point of of this is to make students to focus and be able to learn well. After the students learn they will doing better in school, better grades, and later on they can have better future.

This new technology can help us in many ways because it can helps us to know if there is something wrong happening that maybe it needs to be changed, if we choose to use it we would increase our opportunies to do good. kids would have better education, and the better our education is the better our nation will be.
