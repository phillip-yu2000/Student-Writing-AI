Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Students should be required to perform community service. Community service makes people a better person in their community. It also shows that we care for the world around us. For example students who are more active in their community are more likely to succeed and change the world. Some actions that students make are good choices and others are bad choices, Community service is a good way to change the environment around us.

Some times in life students don't do things because of their friends and other times they do things because of their friends. Well if a popular student could convince another student to perform community service then that student could convince someone else to perform community service. Spreading the news about community service to everyone around us will forever change the world and how we think about it.

Performing community service is not a right but a privilege. Students should be required to perform community service if their grades are low. Not only if their grades are low, but to show go deeds towards people in the neighborhood, communities, city, and even their state.

Some community service participants have even been awarded because of their good deeds that they chose to do.

Community service should be required for all students no matter how old or young they are. As long as they can make a difference in life then they should be required to perform community service. Community service is not just picking up trash around parks or helping out at nursing homes, but a way of life. Community service tasks vary from person to person. Some people might like to help read to little children or help take care of people with disabilities. Community service shows that you have respect for yourself, the people around you, and show much more.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
