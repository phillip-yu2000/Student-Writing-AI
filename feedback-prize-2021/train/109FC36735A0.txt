In the article, it talks about how a computer can caculate everyones emotional expressions. Personally, I believe that it is kind of pointless for a computer to read someones face to tell what type of mood they're in. Easily, another person can look at your face to see what mood you're in.

In paragraph 4, it states that "By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions." For a computer to try and caculate a person's mood or facial expression is pointless. A regular human being can do the same thing. Having a computer trying to figure out someones mood is just similar as someone else doing it.

Just because it is a device or technology figuring out a person's mood doesn't mean it is correct. Normally you would think since a laptop or device is advanced, that it could easily tell a person's current mood. In which, I dont agree with that at all.

Basically, I do not think the use of this technology is valuable. Over all it is pointless from having a device to use for deciding someones mood. I think a person should experience finding out someone else's mood themselves instead of using a pointless device. Using a device to me is basically cheating, and it could all be better by a regular person figuring out emotions on a person's face.
