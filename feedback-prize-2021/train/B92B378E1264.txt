The ozone layer is dissolving, there is no scientific question about it. The world is covered in pollution and in a million years the sun is supposed to swallow most of the planets in the solar system. If we need to flee our planet we need to find our best options and venus might be one of the best.

Venus is often referred to as ¨Earth´s twin¨ , it is about the same size and density, and contains many geographical features that are found on Earth. Many of the gases on this planet can be found on Earth or even be breathed out of your own body (CO2). Venus has many similarities to the Earth we love, learning as much as possible about Venus can help us in the long term. In the text the author talks of how Venus is right around the corner from us and how scientists are trying to build a spacecraft that will be able to withstand the tempretures of the hostile planet. If we humans can acsess information of the planet, when our ozone layer is completly perferated we may be able to switch planets for better living conditions.

Knowing what thrives around us and our planet is not particulary a bad thing. We may have to make adjustiments to our work ethic but it will eventually pay off in the scheme of things. What if there is more life out there? What if the movies you grew up watching are more nonfictional then first thought? Precious metals that can be used to fight wars on Earth are plentiful in surrounding planets and astroids, we just need to find them. Regardless the ozone layer of our planet will not hold forever, we need to know our options for our future progeny.

In conclusion the risks m ay be high but the reward is much higher, we need to explore our options as homosapiens and decide what the risks are worth. The stakes are set pretty high for us, and Venus just may be the answer we've been searching for.
