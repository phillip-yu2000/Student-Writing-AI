There are rumors that aliens have made the face looking lanform on Mars, but they don't really know. Aliens did not make the face on Mars, we have no proof that even aliens exist. The landform could've been foemed when the planet was formed. The face is just a illusion from shadows, from how the planet is tilted towards the sun. NASA took photos of the supposibly face with a high-definition camera, that was more powerful then the one Viking 1 had. The face is just a lava dome that takes the form of a landform. If there was a airplane, hut, or a Egyptian-style pyramid we would be able to see it with no problem, and be able to make out what it is. NASA does wish that there was a ancient object on mars, so they can get information to find out how it was made, how long ago it was created, who made it, is anything living on Mars, and what was it made out of.
