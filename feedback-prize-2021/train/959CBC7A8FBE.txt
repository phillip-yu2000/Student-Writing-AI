People say that driverless cars are the future of driving. If we build these cars people can just sit and relax, and not have to worry about traffic, car crashes, or even just steering the wheel. They however do not know how much money, and or workit takes to have driverless cars of the future My personal opinion about the cars is, I think it will take too much and money and work to have self-driving cars.

Scientist are building new, revolutionary things everyday, so why haven't they found a way to make everyone a driverless car? Well, that is driverless cars arent really driverless; the cars still need a driver. Of corse of the cars have highly advanced sensors in every nook and craney, but in certain situations the car would have to let the driver take over. What is the point of having a driverless car, when the driver has to pay attention at all times to make sure the car can drive in the situation they are in!

Even if the self-driven car provided to be some new technology for everyone to oogle at; eventually it would get boring, they wouldnt be worth the money, and people would stop buying them. Until the time comes when a car of the future is built that can revolutionize the way people look at self diving cars; i will stand by my thought, that self-driving cars, that need a driver are obsoleit.
