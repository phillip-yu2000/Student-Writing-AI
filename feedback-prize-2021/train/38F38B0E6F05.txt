First, I like the way the author write the introduction, because in the article on paragraph 1" sometimes called the evening star and Venus is the secont planet form our sun" shows the author really knows what he/she is talking about. He also support it by including Earth, Venus ,and Mars are goes by different speed; Venus is sometimes right around the conner but sometimes we far from it and closer Mars.

Second, I can tell that the authors research about the past ,because in the article in paragraph 2" each previous mission was unmanned, no spacecarft survived, and not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades" shows he actually know about spacecraft and about 3 decades ago. Also, in paragraph 7 he also conclude about first envisioned in 1800s and 1940s during World War ll.

Third, I like the way the author use to describe Venus because in paragraph 2 and 3, he/she describe by saying" Often referred to as Earth twin" and in paragrath 4 the author suupport it by saying" it may well once have been the most Earth like planet" and " probably covered largely with oceans and various forms of life".

Finally, in the author included about how NASA will be keep challenging to get to the Venus safely and how they will going to working on a machines that last long enought to contribute meaningfully knowledge of venus. This shows that the author researched about how NASA Challenging to get to Venus. To support my sentence, In paragraph 7 " eletronics made of silicon carbide have lasted for three weeks".

In conclusion, the author is good at introduction and the explaining details

,because I can actually imagine how the Venus will be look like just by reading this article.
