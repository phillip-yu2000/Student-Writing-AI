In 'Making Mona Lisa Smile', the Facial Action Coding System purpose is described as to enable computers to read human emotions. Should it be brought into classrooms? I believe that it should, as it will engage students in lessons, content will be taught more efficently and effectively, and students academic performances will improve.

If emotion reading technology is brought in to classrooms, it will spark interest in them. As Dr. Huang explains," A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This could help students focus on the material, better helping their comprehension and understanding, therefore improving their academic performances.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System should be introduced to classrooms. Students will value the impact it will have on the content being taught. Why keep the facial reading technology from students when it can benefit them?
