Why learning at home could really benefit your kids and help jump start there Future. You can be in the safety of your home and it really helps with Developing a Smarter kid; you could go to a Public School but it's not as good as getting home schooled because of the extra help and Attention you get. Students can also save more gas for their Vehicle(s) on average, and have more Freedom to do what they want Between or During Classes. Students also Don't have to ride on a School Bus which can be very Boring for most Non-Student Drivers, and you don't have to Travel to School everyday. Learning at home has the additional benefit of not feeling as Stressed from others. Students can pay attention more because their minds are not as focused on different things like other students who may be Distracting and Disrupting class. I have been Home Schooled for 2 years during Middle School and it really helped me focus and improve myself in so many ways because I didn't feel like I was feeling constantly stressed, i worked on my homework and school work more which also helped me develop the skill to get it done in a timely manner and not put half of the effort into my papers and Research. Research shows that 71.8% of student that are home schooled have a pay of $20 dollars or more for there starting job. I think home schooling your kid far outweighs the cons of going to a Public School because it's safer, you save more money becuase your not going as far to get your kid a edicuation and it's a better enviorment to work in and you and your kid have way more time to do whatever you want after School.
