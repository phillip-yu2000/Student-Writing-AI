The concept of distance learning is to make education easy to access, convenient way to educate the student and student will be able learn in there homes. while public school are getting more involve of mass shooting parents are worried about their child's life. situation like this is one benefit of distance learning in this way of learning parents are capable of protecting their child from threat physically or mentally. this event often occur in public school because of lack of security and gun control in that particular area.

The down side of this concept is people wont be able to build trust,make friend and interact with other student. this is one of the parents concern. that their child will not be able to interact with other students and being in a distance learning your skill of communication will not improve unless you have someone to talk and interact with. this is why that distance learning is only optional because it's not very effective. every student have different way of learning and skills. distance learning might not be for other student.

Distant learning is not effective to people who is very active, play a lot of sports and friendly people. that is only few of the flaws. many of the flaws have something to do with learning capabilities. because of this reason many people who is very active student will not enjoy the distance learning and the majority of the student prefer to study in there public school.
