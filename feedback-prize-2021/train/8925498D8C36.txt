Asking for multiply peoples opinions is good because you can know what everyone thinks about it and how they feel about it to,sometimes they need to know more about the topic and they also go to someone just to see what the other people think about it and just get more opinions on it .

you might just want some more advice on what your doing. Some people give more advice then others. Also more know more about it the others and anyone can know about but not know much about. You can go to anyone and ask what their opinion is on something they will give there opinion does not mean it is going to be the same as everyone else. Just by asking one person what they think is not going to help you,but by asking multiply people opinion can Hall more.

You might think when one person give advice on something it was not that good and you want to get more about it then you would go to another person and ask then. Advice is good to get before you just go out there and do it on your own. You also want to know more then about the thing your doing just by asking one person is not going to help you. In conclusion asking more people is a good idea to do when you need to know more.
