When sitting in class do you ever feel like you can read someones emotion, well now you can. With the new program Facial Action Coding System you can make a 3-D model of someone and scan the face mucsles to tell you what emotions they are feeling. You have six basic emotions that this program can detect just by your mucsles in your face. When they scanned Mona Lisa's face she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry.

Now if people start turnning towards this method of telling how people feel instead of asking them to make them feel better then you are shutting yourself off from society and that's not okay. If you want to now how someone feels don't make a 3-D model of their face to have a computer tell you just go up and ask them how they feel and what will make them feel better. It amazes you when you find out how many people turn towards technology instead of face to face converstations.

Fianally if you scan someones face to see if you can make them feel better than you are doing it all wrong. You need to walk up to that person and say "Are you okay, what do you need to help you". Also when you do scan someones face they can put on whats called a "Fake Smile" and trick the computer into thinking it's a actual smile, so it will say they are happy when in reality you are mad or upset. Put down the elctronics and focus on what's important in life.
