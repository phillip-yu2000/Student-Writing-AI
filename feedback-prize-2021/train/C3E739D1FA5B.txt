I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it gives the students a chance to figure out what they enjoy doing, and for those who love playing sports but never put any force into actually playing, now they have a chance. For instance, if a kid loves playing basketball, but she decided she didn't want to disturb her parents because being on a team might've been too much trouble for them, now she has a chance to actually play and do something that she loves. If children start playing sports now, and doing other things that they are passionate about. It gives them more of a chance to get into colleges that specify in that sport or activity that they are in. Also it gives them a better future since they are engaging in something now that way they can start setting up goals and work their way up in the future. If a student needed a distraction from his life at home, being required to play a sport or doing an extracurricular activity could help him. Or if a student wanted to try something new, that he has never done before, doing an activity could help help him out. In conclusion, I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because, it gives them a chance to release their stress, have fun, try something new, and put their passion to work.
