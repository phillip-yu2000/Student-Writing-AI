In 1976 NASA captured a picture of a landform on Mars . The landform resembeld a blurred face . Many people beleive that this martian "face " was created by aliens . However these theories have proven to be false with photos, and common logic.

Since the first sighting of the face more photos have been taken . Each new picture is clearer than the last . A photo taken in the year of 2001 shows the face to be a landform and nothing else . In fact the face is a mesa which is a common landform in the American West.

Some critics support theories that NASA is hiding the knowledge of life on Mars. It would be a giant step in discovery and extremely exciteing if these ideas came to be true but unfortunatly they haven't .

Despite the many theories that surround the face, the face isn't a face at all (though it would be cool if it actually was

)and NASA is'nt hiding proof of life on Mars . And in the the end the theories are just theories no matter how entertaining or true they seem to be .
