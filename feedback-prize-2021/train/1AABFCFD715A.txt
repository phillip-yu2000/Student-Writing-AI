Dear Principle,

I have heard that there are disagreements over whether to perform community service or not. I will present the advantages to both sides of this matter, and suggest one of my own opinion. However, the decision shall remain yours. While community service is very helpful, some people may disagree. This is because it uses their own time. These are the two dominant sides to this matter.

Community service is something that benefits everyone, including the ones performing it. It allows you to contribute to society and help others. Public services are greatly affected by small services from people like you and me. Things such as malls, churches, schools, hospitals, and even highways are good places to start. They allow you to help out in small ways, and are simple and easy places to help, such as by picking up trash, repainting parking lots, emptying trash cans, and many other things like these.

However, some people do not like that this spends their personal time. I can understand this, and hopefully you can too. Some people need time alone or with family, and most would definitely prefer that over community service. Many people, however, are constantly preoccupied, so they are unable to help. They have things to do such as meeting friends, attending parties, visiting relatives, and such things as these.

I am between both sides, for I believe in public services, and personal time. My plan is that we should perform these services, but in the times we choose. This should satisfy both sides, for it will not take up any important times, and it will benefit the community overall. Though it may be more towards the side of community service, I hope you will take my plan into consideration while making this decision. I hope that you will choose wisely, and that my fellow students will be satisfied with whatever choice you do select.

Sincerely,
