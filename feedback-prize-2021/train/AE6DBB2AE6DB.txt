Summer projects are beneficial for learning. Students should design their own projects over the summer because they have time, can work with friends, and are educated about the subject. Some state that teachers should design the project because they have more experience and better planning, but this is false. Although some may disagree, students should design their own projects over the summer.

There are many reasons why this decisions should be made. Students manage their time in the summer differently making the designing process easier. They can use information they've learned previously in the school year when designing the project, helping the students gain time management skills. They can also choose their own topic allowing them to be informed of what they're designing. When a student picks a topic they enjoy, the final product will display a large amount of effort and dedication

There are further reasons why students should be able to design their own projects. Students get help from their friends who generate ideas for the students designing the project. Friends also help better the bonds they from with the students while spending time designing the project. Students can get help from their family member who help educate them, teach them new tactics, and purchase necessary materials required that the students cant afford. Lastly, students can go online to locate sources they can use to gather information while designing; furthermore, the students can locate articles provided by verified authors.

When students design their own project , they are in control. They gain skills through designing with the help from friends, family, and the internet. Students who design their own project gain skills they will forever use.
