Our founding fothers wanted our goverment to be "for the people, by the people". But we can't run our goverment if the electors vote for us. We should have the right to vote for who we want to run our nation. Thats why I think our nation should use popular vote when electing our nations President and Vice President.

In the Bill of Rights we are given the freedom of speach, freedom of press, and freedom of religion. Shouldn't we have the freedom to elect the leaders of our nation? We have worked hard to give everybody the right to vote, but yet electors are voting for us. Acording to an excerpt from "The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defense are wrong" they talk about how voters canot always control who their electors vote for. That means that your vote was practicly useless. In "The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defense are wrong", they state that "At the most basic leval, the electoral collage is unfair to voters." They also talk about how candites don't spend much time in states they have no chance of winning in. Instead they only focus on states that they know they will suceade in. "It's offical: The electoral collage is unfair, outdated, and irrational." I belive that in order for us to be in control, we should at least get a say on who will lead our nation.

Though the Electoral Collage isn't the fairest, most acurate way to vote, it also isn't such a bad idea. Evan though we have the right to vote, we abuse that power. we don' think of the consiqunces that will come with who we ellect. We look at all the possitive things somebody has done but don't look at the negitive things. With The Electoral CollageÂ  we have a group of people deciding what is best for our nation,
