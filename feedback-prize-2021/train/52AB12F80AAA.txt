Senator I would not like to keep the Electoral College, it's not a good method, I know we are voting fir the President either way, but why can't we vote for the President right away? Instead of voting for a slate of electorsÂ  to vote for us? We are not babies that can't vote for our President right away, we have common sense and are grown up enough to know who we are going for. The method is unfair and outdated, we nned to abolish the electoral college. This method is a non-democratic one, and should be overruled. It is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state, canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance at winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. The electoral college is uneeded and irrational, we don't care about it an would like for you to agree with us and abolish it, if yiu do not, we undersdtand, on behalf of all the disagreeing persons to this method, join us and you will see our way of thinking, and see our way is much easier without a doubt sir and/or ma'am, have a great time, bye.
