Dear principal,

The use of phones at school lunch is good for the students both educationally and socially. With the use of phones at school students could be more socially and educationally active. If you let students use phones at lunch their is less chance they will be using there phones in class.

If you let the students at least once a day bring out their phones there will be a happy student body at this school. A happy student body is important because if the student body is not happy their is a chance the students are more likely to break rules.

In addition if the students forget their work they could call their parents to bring their work to school. Did i mention students could then use up their time socializing and getting more efficient with technology.

I ask you on behalf of the student body to let the students of this school to bring their cell phones and use it at lunch period. To have an A plus school you must have an A plus student body. You could get the A plus student body you deserve by giving us the right to use are phones at recess. Phones are involved with our everyday life!

Sincerely,
