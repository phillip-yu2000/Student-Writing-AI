I think that we should use policy 1 because some kids have to walk home and should keep there cell phones on them just in case any thing happens to them. Also if you are in at school and someone gets hurt and nobody is around they can use their cell phones and call for help. Students always use their phones to communicate with other people so if they use them at free time and lunch they won't use them at inappropriate times. When students walk home they could get lost if they just moved, get hurt if someone attacked them or if they fall. In school you could also fall and get hurt and if nobody is around they can call for help. Finally students sometimes text other people when there not suppose to so if you can let us use it during free time and lunch time we might not use them at inappropriate times. That is why we should be able to have and use cell phones at school but only at appropriate times.
