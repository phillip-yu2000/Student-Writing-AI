Dear principal,

Many teen students have been using cell phones during school. It is against school policy to do this and many teachers do not take much action in stopping this. But I believe that reconsidering this to allow students to use cell phones during free time and lunch is not a good idea. This is not a good idea because most cellular devices come with the use of internet and this can be abused by most teenage students.

If you consider policy number 1, then I believe students at lunch will use the internet on there phone to look up any answers to at test or any other forms of classroom work. Student could just skip a problem on a test and wait until lunch to look it up which defeats the purpose of studying and learning. Also cell phones could be abused the same way in other free times using text messaging. During free times a student could use text messaging to stay in touch with a friend who has already taken the test or work and cheat.

Also student could also use the internet by looking at graphic pictures or videos. During free times teachers do not know what the student could be doing on his or her cell phones. This could be a big problem to schools and teachers who allow the use of cell phones in class. Blocking these sites on school computers does not effect the same sites on a cell phone. So even though blocking the sites, this will not block the same sites visited on a cellular device by a student.

Students all over the country are abusing the use of cell phones in class. They use them to cheat during test and exams or use them to look up unapproved websites. And allowing them to have them out means less security on what they might be doing on them. So I do not agree on letting students use cell phones, and that there should be a higher security on the use of these devices because modern day cell phones are pretty much like hand held computers and you never know what a student could be using it for.
