Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you where apart of the Seagoing Cowboys program. Well I have and it was a great experience. I got to see new places and meet new people.

Also, I have made new memories in different places of the world like China and Europe. I even got to experience new things will traveling like the people that I helped and the places I went. I knew it was the opportunity of a lifetime to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

"The cattle trips were unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy,". Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a great experience for me. It taught me it takes resposibility and hard work to get things done. It also taught me that you can't take the easy way out. I will take this experience to heart for the rest of my life until I die.

To sum my thoughts I think being a Seagoing boy was a fantastic experience. I know if you join you will learn and grow from the new places and new people you meet. This is probably one of the greatest experiences i have had.
