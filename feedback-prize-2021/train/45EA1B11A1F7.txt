Dear Principal;

I am arguing against raising the average to participate in sports or other activities to a B. It is a good idea for having students earn participation in sports or activities.

Most students just can't make a B average.

There are many great athletes that can't make B averages that we need to participate in sports.

In my opinion, the average should be lowered to a C average, that way they can earn participation in sports, but it is possible for everyone.

Lowering the average to a C is a good idea because a lot of great athletes can't make a B average.

To have our school excel in sports, we must have these great athletes.

Most of the best athletes at this school can really only make C averages.

It is a lot easier to make C averages, so we can have great athletes participate.

Most colleges that are the best in sports require students to make C averages.

Are school will be great in sports with great athletes that have more time to focus on sports instead of grade averages.

Not lowering the average to a C will eliminate the best athletes.

I think it is important for students to earn participation academically, but a B average is just too much.

I hope you will change your mind about having expectations that are too high for students.

I think if students make a D or F average, they shouldn't be able to participate, but if they make a C average it should be enough to participate.

In conclusion, raising the average to a B to participate is a bad idea.

Most student athletes have a hard time making B averages, so it will be easier to make C averages.

If it is a B average, this school won't excel in athletics.

Sincerely,
