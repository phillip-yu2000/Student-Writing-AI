To TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that we should have the second cell phone policy at school because cell phones increase the drama on school campus, they disrupt class time whenever they go off and they can be used as tools for cheating on tests.

First of all, students shouldn't have their phones at school because they increase the drama on school campus. For example students will spread abominable rumors about other students. Students will also text each other the latest gossip about the other students which distracts them from learning. Drama might still be around without cell phones but the amount of it will decrease once we get rid of cell phones from this school.

Likewise, cell phones can go off in class which disrupts the students and teachers during class. Namely, cell phones will sound their ring tones which will attract students' attention, and the teacher will have to take his/her time to tell the student to put it away. Also, students might text in class attracting their attention away from the teacher and the lesson and to their phone. This problem must be stopped before it spreads.

Furthermore, the students might even use cell phones to cheat on tests. On STAR
