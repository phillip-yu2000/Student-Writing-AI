Dear Ms. Principal:

It has come to my attention as a student, that you may be changing your policies on cell phone use in school. It is my personal opinion that you should allow student to use their phones outside of class. I think this because, myself being a student here, cell phones allow students to contact their families, contact teaching staff, and stay in touch with one another during school hours.

First off, we students are often given difficult projects that we must complete. For example, a group project assigned to two students who don't see each other outside of school hours. Wouldn't it be better for these to students to be able to speak to one another during school hours? This is one of my reasons for supporting the use of cell phones during free time.

Secondly, students may need to contact their families during the day. A student may be a bus rider, but due to bad weather the student may need to be picked up by car. It would be much easier for this student to be able to use their cell phone then to have to borrow one from a teacher or go to the office. Or they may need to tell their mother or father to turn the stove off or let the dog out.

lastly, a student may need to contact a member of the teaching staff for information on a project. Or they may need to ask a question about tonight's homework. Or maybe another student falls and injures themselves, or a fight brakes lose, it would be easy and very convenient to be able to use cell phones in school.

To conclude, the use of cell phones during school would be very beneficial for the student population. I hope I have made you see clearer the benefits of allowing us students to use them.

Sincerely, a concerned student.
