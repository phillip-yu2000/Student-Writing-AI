Lukes point of view convincing others to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program is that the reason to join the program is because it makes you more aware of the people from many other countries and what their needs are. People out their may be suffering from illnesses or they can be dying. They also can be or get killed in and by wars. We should care more about the people out their while we still can because we are safe but others are not. We can save lives. The military helps us a lot by keeping us and our country safe. We don't want our population to drain down really fast because we are all family and together we can save lives. Can you imagine what Luke Bomberger had gone through. He had to check on animals every hour, he could have died by slidding on a slippery ladder on his backside. He also couldn't work because he had cracked ribs. Him and the crew had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. They had to work really hard. They had to drink a lot of water to stay hydrated because if not they would be kind of weak and would be tired most of the time. They probably wouldn't have enough strength for all that hard work they had to go through.
