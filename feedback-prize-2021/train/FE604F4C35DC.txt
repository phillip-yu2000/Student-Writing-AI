The future is coming. In this modern age, we have personal assistants on our phones, holographic keyboards, and even 3D TVs. It's not that far fetched that soon we could also have self-driving cars as well. Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but they first should be tested so no hazardous glitches remain.

Recently there have been multiple breakthroughs that have advanced progress on making an actual self-driving car. One such advances was the more advanced sensors that are now put on cars. Now, these sensor help alert drivers to where a possibly dangerous situation is, but in the future they could be used as the "eyes" for the car. No car would be able to drive on it's own without being able to sense which direction it's going. As well there have been multiple breakthroughs with computer systems, which would give the car the know-how in order to drive on it's own. Lastly, thanks to satellite imaging, almost the entire world has been mapped out. This, added along with everything else, could really help realize the future of the self-driving car.

Now even though this idea sounds fantastic, it's not without flaws. Sometimes computers will suffer errors in their programming. Most of the time, this isn't too important, but if it happened to a self-driving car with someone in it, the results could be disasterous. The cars would need to be heavily tested to get rid of as many of these errors as possible. As well, there would also have to be a new set of laws that pretain to self-driving cars. One such law would be if a car crashed, who would be responsible, the passenger or the manufacturer?

Self-driving cars are quickly becoming a reality, but first they need to be tested to make sure they don't have any hazardous glitches. In this modern age, we have personal assistants on our phones, holographic keyboards, and even 3D TVs. It's not much of a stretch of the imagination to think that self-driving cars could arrive soon. The future is definitely coming.
