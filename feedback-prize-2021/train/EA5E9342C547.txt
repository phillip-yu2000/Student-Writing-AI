Driving vehicles is a easy way to transport, but on the downside it is effecting the air in a very bad way. Every day people are driving cars and trucks knowing that it pollutes the air but are doing nothing to stop it. If everybody stopped driving vehicles the world would be a much healthier place and much safer too. This is because the burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air, and brings harm to pedestrians when there is a unexpierenced or drunk driver. A good way to prevent this from happening is to get a bunch of people or even everyone to quit driving.

Though driving is an easy means of trasportation so is riding a bike, a skateboard, walking, running, all these things can get you to your destination. Yes these things will take longer but it will also be a good exercise and will not be polluting the air. Not only is it polluting the air but it is also a very expensive way of transportation because you pay for the car then all the gas it takes to get from one place to another. Every year the world should have a week of no driving so the air can clear up and to show everyone that they are making a big mistake driving every single day to get to work or go pick up groceries.

In Vauban, Germany they have a suburb with nearly 5,500 residents that live car-free! These people try to keep their environment as clean as possible. In the article "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" by Elisabeth Rosenthal she said "Automobiles are linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes..." This meaning that to many people are relying on cars and need to stop to help us, to help earth.
