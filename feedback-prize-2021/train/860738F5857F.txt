Dear principle, I believe that changing the school policy so that students with a grade B average may only participate in sports and other activities is unfair. I understand that education and academics is more important than sports or other activities but most students find it real difficult to keep up our grades, study for tests, and even do homework because we feel that we are being pushed passed our limit and we are too busy to continue to focus on academics. And most times students feel overwhelmed with homework and its just too much for us to handle so students become involved in sports or other activities to stop and take a break from academics so that we don't become too stressed out because it could eventually lead to depression and fatigue and we begin to lose interest and don't forth much effort into what we are trying to accomplish. And academics isn't the only thing that allows us to continue on and progress in life, students who are real athletic and are talented in a specific sport may receive a scholarship to college for being excellent and may continue to play a professional sport. Same with musicians they may continue and begin a band, become a songwriter or singer or maybe even participate in special events that require talented musicians.
