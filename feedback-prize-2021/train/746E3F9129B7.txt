We should change the Electoral College to election by popluar vote. As its states in the text "The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." When you vote for a president, your actually voting for a state elector. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote wont win the national popular vote, but that happens rarely. Over 60% of voters would prefer direct elections.

Voters doesnt vote for the president in the electoral college, they actually vote for the slate of electors. Wouldnt you want to vote for the persident you want except voting for the electors? Its unfair that some states has more representatives than others because if its up to to the representatives big states, such as California has 55 representatives which represent 35 million voters. So as a example if the votes are tied and its up to Wyoming and California to decide who is president, Obama or Romney, and if California representatives voted for Romney, then even if Wyoming representatives voted for Obama, Romney would of won.

They should let us (citizens of America) vote for president except for the electors. In my personal opinion, there would be a higher amount of votes per president. It'll be fair if the president would be elected by the most popular votes. The president that has thhe most votes should be the one who wins it all.
