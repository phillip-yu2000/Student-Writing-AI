Dear Principal,

I would like to say my opinion about participating in sports or other activities is that you should have to maintain atleast a B in every subject. Before you participate in sports or other activities school always comes first, which is most important to focus more on than joining sports or other activities without doing work. If students know that school work is always their number one priority than they should know that it is most important for them to get good grades. In qualifying sports it should be required to maintain a B in every subject.

I think this because if student who participate in sports get good grades since sports in very important to them then most likely the students would want to atleast do their work and to try their best knowing that they do care for their grade since they are in sports.

Student who also join sports and will maintain atleast a grade of a B in every subject will not really have to worry since they know that they are already doing good with all of their school work. The better grades they get in school shows that they do pay attention in class instead where students don't pay attention or don't do their work and getting a bad grade. The student would need to atleast give up sports and try to do all of his/her work first to get better grade, so that the student can continue to do sports again.

Thank you for all your understanding! I really do appreciate it a lot because students grades are very important to the department of education, parents of the students, and what they are learning in school is always the students number one priority before participating in any other sports or activities.

Sincerely,

one of your students at this school
