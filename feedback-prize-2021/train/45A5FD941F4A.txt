Dear principal,

I heard you are considering changing the school's policy about sports. As you might know I'm not so fond of sports myself, but students do need exercise for their body. I'm not saying they should fail all their grades and be playing sports all the time. All I'm trying to get to is that, this wont change them. Schools need to encourage kids to take part in daily sports right? This wont motivate them at all, now will it? They need to exercise, after all they're still young. Why cancel sports? Which is very healthy for kids. Why not cancel their dances? Now, this will motivate the whole school to get better grades. But, if you do decide to cancel sports for kids with a grade lower than a B, they can find other places to have fun and play sports. So why try to cancel it for them? Good grades, bad grades every child has rights to choose, it's their own decision if they don't want to be a success in their life. My opinion in this situation is, don't make it impossible for kids with bad grades not to be able to play sports. If you do make this change official, kids will just find another way to play sports with their friends. Good or bad, it may be dangerous. Who will be responsible for teenagers playing in the middle of the street? You, by taking away their privileges. Now I'll leave it for you to decide, is it worth the change?
