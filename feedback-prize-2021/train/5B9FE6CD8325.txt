The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is known as Eath's "twin" and is closest planet to Earth, and the untold mysteries it holds.

Exploring Venus to study is infact dangerous but as the aouthor states in the text " Today, Venus still has some features that are analgous to thos on Earth". This line explains that the possibilities of surving in Venus is about 50/50, it also meant that if Venus has these various feathers that Earth have, then it's the chances of being able to go there is hiher because of feathers like; oceans, valleys, mountains, craters, and differnt forms of life. It also says that " NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray".

This is significant because it explained how the NASA already have plans and intructions for this event that they are hoping to make it happen. Furthermore, it says how the process and devices would help them to go on Venus and how it is survivable for humans because the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to the NASA's knowledge of Venus.

This article shows all the possibilities of surviving on Venus to study the Venus with their new machines, and innovations for the sucess.
