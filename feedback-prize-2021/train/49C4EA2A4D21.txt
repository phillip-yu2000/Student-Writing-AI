Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that your first policy which is allowing us to bring our phones to school and keep it off in all classes except lunch times and at other free times is a delightful idea if i do say so my self. As the president, captain cheer leading, and in charge of chess club I think your strategy may work like for example if you bring your phone and you use it and you constantly get it taken away and yelled and teachers call you belligerent student that is not going to work but if he or she changes their belligerent ways. I think that this policy will be a remedy for our problems and our action. This policy is like a compromise if you think about it would not be going your way and it will not be going their way that way they can use their phones during free time and learn during class hour I think it's a "win win " situation both for the children and you. I think you should do it we would not want to start a bedlam would we?

Another reason why the second policy is not as good as the first is because the whole time students would sneak the phones into class. then the teacher would take it away, then the student would go to the office, and then the students mind would stay stagnant and not germinate like it is supposed to. trust me ms surah you would not want that to happen!

So instead of making the conflict of cell phones more difficult than it should be you should choose policy two so that we could be together in unison instead of all of us running around like crazy people and children tell the truth that's why policy two is better if i do say so myself.

Love:

your president , captain of cheer leading and in charge of chess
