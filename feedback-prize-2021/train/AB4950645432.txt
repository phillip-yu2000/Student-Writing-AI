Driverless cars are coming. The author made very positive points about the driverless cars, but i'm going with all the negatives. Although having a driverless car would be cool, easy, and fast i think it's still highly dangours. There is really no point to having a driverless cars because, you as the driver, or "passenger" still has to stay alert when the driverless cars are is either around accidents or traffic jams. When you are in a regualr car you place for feet on the gas and breaks, in the driverless cars where would you put for feet if the car is doing the driving for you, and not to mess up the car's flow you have to sit unconfortable. Stated in paragraph 8, it says wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? I thinking for everyone here. We all know driving in our world today we as drivers are fair on the road but not fair. How so? How so because we as drivers somtimes do not pay attention to the road, and just go when we think its are turn. While in the driverless cars if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault? If someone was injured due to the driverless car no one wouldn't really know who to blame so you could say the manufacturer, but it would not be fair because at the end of the day no one gets any money. Even though driveless cars can be cool, easy, and fast there bad in my veiw.
