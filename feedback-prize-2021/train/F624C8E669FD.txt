This program sounds really fun and you should join. Thats what im talking about in my story to day. I hope after this you consider joining.

One reason I think you should join is it would be a fun experience. You would be able to sightsee while your on the boat. You would get to play games on the boat to pass by time. Most important of all you get to help people and that should make you happy. Thats why I think it would be a fun experince.

Another reason I think you should join is that its a lifetime oppotunity. You to go to war and save people save our country and would make me smile. You get go on an adventure of a once lifetime and tell me that wouldn't be fun. You also get to serve our country and that is awesome. That why I think it is a lifetime opputunity.

The last reason is you get to go on a lot of adventures. You get to go places you never been before. You probably will go to the U.K alot. Same for the alantic ocean you will probablay be on it alot. Thats why I think adventures would be fun.

Thats my reason and ideas why I think you should come join us at the program. I hope this made up your mind about coming. Alright I'll see you if you come.
