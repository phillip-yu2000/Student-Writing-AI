Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I see that you have taken consideration into if the students have to participate in community service. Community service is a really good thing to do and there is many different ways you can perform it. You could mow lawns, wash cars, clean up litter, and help elderly people with things around their homes. Any of those you do would be great and considered as community service. But also, I don't believe that the service should be required to be performed. Some people may think it takes up too much of their time and maybe it does but it is for a good cause. It may give people more than what they can handle and give them a hard time.

Most students really study hard now to keep their grades up and the community service could possibly take the time that they do that away from them. The community service project should be an optional thing and if students decide to do it the service could be lots of extra credit points or something. Community service can be fun and life changing for people and the help of the students servicing could really turn someone's day in the right direction. But you have to have a kind and caring heart to do it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
