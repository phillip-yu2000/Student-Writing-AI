When you ask advice you go to friends family to get their opinions on something like should I buy a new pair of shoes or should I sell the old ones. The reason why you should go to different people is to know will you know who's opinion do you want to go with. People should always go to another person to see what somebody might say because what is you had a question about school on whether you should take your phone with you to school you might have some people might say no and some might say yes but it is ultimately our decision. When you go to people fro their advice you go to multiple people to see what they are going to say about something. I all ways ask more than three or more people to see what they say on whether you should get this or not. Making decisions is important when you become a an adult because you have to make critical decisions. Why this statement is important to me is when you need help you always go to your friends about or mom or dad about an important decision. People always want to make the best decision in your life. You should always ask before you do or make a decision about buying something. I also think it is important to ask more people is because what is you change your mind you would not want to make the wrong choice just because you did not want to talk the another person.

When you ask a another person you have more Intel about what you are going to buy sell or store but you should always get a different perspective about something, its almost like picking a candidate to choose and to see who's opinions is better and gives a better fact. Asking will and most times will figureout if you should get want you want or do want you want to do but if your never sure always ask a friend or ask a family member.
