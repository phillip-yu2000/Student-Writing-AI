Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. How would this affect students? this can affect students because they can get distracted by video games or phones. The problem is that some students get online classes but they just want to sleep more and than they don't do the online classes work or they play video games. this is why this is a bad idea.

first, one reason of why online classes will affect students is the distraction, for example they can get distracted by video games very easily by a friend calling them to ask if he want play, or by get bored get the phone and see they instagram.

to continue, the second reason is because they get sleeping to late at night and wake up to late, for example they can get sleeping late at night watching TV or playing video games with they friends. Some might says that online classes can be beneficial for students, but they don't know if the students are really working in they online classes because the distractions of video game or phones.

So the problem are some students who only want the easy way for everything include school.

the online classes are a bad idea because the distractions like video, phones, no sleep during night, or instagram.

To conclude this theme, I just want to remain you if you are taking online classes or you go to school, please do your best to be successful in life.
