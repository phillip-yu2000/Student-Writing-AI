Human emotion. Once thought to be something held exclusive to humans, can now be interpreted by computers. Allowing anything with a camera to read the muscles in ones face to tell the emotion they currently portray. There are many different outlooks on the future use of this technology, but one in particular focuses on using it in the classroom.

The technololgy used to read our emotions is known as the Facial Action Coding System or FACS. It models a human face and all 44 of its muscles, and looks for certain cues to tell them emotion being conveyed by the subject. FACS can tell when one is happy, sad, angry, cionfused, surprised, disgusted, and afraid. FACS can even tell the difference between "fake" emotions and real ones. This means that it can tell if a facial expression is being forced, based on what muscles are being used.

On the subject of use in the classroom, it could be very benificial to students and teachers alike. It can read when a student gets confused on a topic, and can then adjust the lesson to fit their needs. It can tell when a student is feeling drowsy and upset, or when a student is attentive and alert. This way teachers can recognize when a student needs assistance. This technology, in all, can be very useful if applied to them classroom, and even the rest of the world, properly, making it a very impressive step into the future for mankind.

Just think. A computer able to read the human face to determi9ne what emotion they feel. Skepticism is understandable, what with the advancement of AI and related movies such as The Terminator, where AI has tooken over the human race, but a future like that is to be left in the world of fiction. This technology is the next step into the age of human technology integration, like we've already seen with the introduction of smart devices. Mankind will only continue to move forward and innovate, even beyond percieved limits.
