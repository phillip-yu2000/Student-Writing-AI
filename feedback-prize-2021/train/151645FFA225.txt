Dear Mrs. Principal,

I an very concerned with the sports teen grade average. I am coming to you regarding the "B" average grade change that these teens would need instead of a "C" average to be able to participate in school sports. I would really like to discuss this. I and other fellow eighth graders of SCHOOL_NAME, agree that this "B" average should be changed back to a "C" average. I really think that in order to play sports you need a

"C" average instead of a "B" average. This is so because, many students have a "C" average in middle school, this means that these students that are on the sports teams and do have "C" averages, would not be able to play if they had changed it to a "B" average in order to play on a sports team. A lot of students would be spending more of their time playing video games and watching TV instead of getting that out of school work outs that teenagers need. I know that most teachers and principles would think that if they are not on a sports teen then they are at home studying, but i am here to tell you that i am a middle school teenager as well and I would most definitely rather spend my time playing video games instead of studying and playing sports. I really hope that you read this and definitely consider not changing the grade average on sports.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME an eighth grade student.
