Personally I think giving advice is hard because thinking of things for yoursef makes you think your ideas aren't going to be as good enough as others. But while others think its easy to give advice, I think it's not that easy because your opinion relys on what they think about giving advice. But asking more than one person is their option, not anyone elses. But here's what my thought process is when people talk to more than one person when giving advice. Talking to more than one person can give more options to think about what advice you want to give and how the minds think alike. Giving advice is hard, so asking more than one person could really help because more minds thinking of things, makes new ideas. Also, it can be a better choice because doing things by yourself and giving advice by yourself is not as easy as most people would think. Another thing is that it could improve your thinking skills and key words to say when your giving advice. Lastly, talking to more than one person giving advice is a good choice because you can hear someone elses opinion on the same thought, just said and expressed differently.
