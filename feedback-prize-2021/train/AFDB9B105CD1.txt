I'm hear to tell you my oposing opinion on the use of using technology to determine someones emotions. And whether or not I agree or disagree with the authors statements.

I do not think that we should use technology to determine people's emotion(s), It wouldn't help us out on advancing as a soceity. Also not everyone makes the same facial expression for the emotion they are feeling so its going to be based on generalized facial expressions which won't be accurate. And also what kind of information would be collected by the way peop[le are feeling and how would that help us old in our daily lives. Also having some camera watch you the whole time while your online doesn't seem like the most enjoyable experience for everyone. Dr. Haung predicted that it would help for video surgery, but i dont see that helping much at all because knowing someone's emotions won't effect the way that the surgeon will go through on the operation.

Those are my opsing thoughts about usuing technology to determine someone's emotional state.
