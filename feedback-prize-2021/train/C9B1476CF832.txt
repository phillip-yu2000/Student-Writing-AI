Dear our beloved Principal,

I would just like to say that I think you should change the school policy from only students with at least a B average can participate in sports to only kids with at least a C average can participate. I think this rule should be changed because a C is still considered a passing grade just like an A or a B. If only kids with at least a B average can play then you might not have enough kids to play on our teams and not be able to win. Also sometimes kids try their best to get good grades but sometimes they have lots of problems at home and they don't have time to study or get a lot of their homework done so all they ever get is a C. Its not fair to them if they want to play school sports but they cant because they don't have the right grade. But also there are some kids who are just plain lazy and get lucky by getting a C they will still get to play but that's alright because at least the people who deserve to play are getting too. Another thing should be added to the policy, if you get more than three detentions you shouldn't be allowed to play for that year or if you get one ISS or OSS you shouldn't be allowed to play either. Those are my opinions and i hope you take them into consideration.

Sincerely, Your Student
