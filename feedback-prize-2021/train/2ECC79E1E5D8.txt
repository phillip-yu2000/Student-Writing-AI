WHY DO WE HAVE TO!!!

My position on this matter is that not everyone likes sports, doing yearbooks, or serving on student council. some students would like to just go to school do their work get a grade and go home.

Students dont really like doing extracurricular activities. Some just like to get in trouble or do their work and go home.

Some students dont really know what they want to be in life. Some just make up something they want to be but, dont put out any effort in trying to achieve that goal. So honestly the principal should not say you must/ have to join a extracurricular activity , because what if you join and you end up getting injured then it would be the principals conscience because he/she made you join the sports team, or what if you break a wrist, or a arm then you can not type the yearbook, or what is you dont like political stuff but they make you sign up for it.

The principal would have to think about what the students like also. He/she can not just make anyone join anything if they dont wan t to join. The parents of the students would be upset if their child came home everyday saying "I dont like what activity they made me do" then the principal would feel some type of way because then he would be getting complaints from parents saying I want my son/daughter out of that activity.

The principal needs to think about everyone else's feelings and not just his own.
