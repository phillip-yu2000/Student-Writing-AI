The reason why people ask multiple people cause everybody has a different opion on the same questions. Not all people are the same and some may think the same thing. But you always need to ask multiple people so you make sure you know for sure. And just cause u asked another person dosent mean there opion is right. And say you ask for advice for some help some kids just like to joke around. So there was this one time where i really needed help with some work and i didnt know how to do it so when i went to ask all they did was joke around and tell me wrong answers. So what i did was i went to the teacher and asked him for help so when i did that he actually made me understand it so what i'm trying to say is if your friend likes to joke around when u actually need help just ask a teacher cause there gonna pay more attention then one of Ur friends will. And I had another time where I really nedded help getting my basketball form better so i tried asking my brother but he didn't help so I asked my rec basketball team so i satrted to do better in practice so thats when my coach put me as starter.

The end.
