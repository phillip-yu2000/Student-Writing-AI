Scientists want to study Venus for a variety of reasons, it seems. They have discovered valleys, mountains, and craters in Venus's surface. NASA seems to be working on several ideas for machiens to go down to Venus's surface as well.

NASA is working on a few different projects for going down to Venus's surface. One of these projects is a set of simplified electonics made, or coated, with silicon carbide. This material is proven, in a simulation chamber, to be able to handle conditions not unlike those on the surface of Venus. It'll have to be able to handle acidic rain, lightning stikes, and extremely high temperatures. 800* F, in fact.

But, why would anybody even want to study Venus? It's so brutal over their. Well, scientists think that long ago, it may have been an Earth-like planet. This is where the mountains, etc come in. Because Earth and Venus both have these rock formations. The atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide, which could have come from severe global warming, which brings the temp. up to 800*F. We're slowly heading that way, so people on Mars, in a long, long time, might be making these same observations, about Earth. Or maybe, they already did, a long, long time ago. Either way, NASA wants to be able to make closer observations about Venus. They think hovering 30 miles above its surface would still be at temperatures of around 170* F, which is still pretty warm, you'll want a lot of AC. But, the radiation levels won't be unlike that of earth, and the air pressure would be about that of sea level on earth. So, it'd be rough living, but it'd be fairly survivable for humans to live in.

So, again, Venus is a tough planet, it's atmosphere is absolutely crazy dangerous. There's lighting, earthquakes, and freaking volcanoes!!

Plus, it's atmospheric pressure, is 90 times that of Earths!!!!

But yeah, it's definitely be great to get some of those rock samples or gas samples from Venus. I think it'd definitely be a planet worth studying.
