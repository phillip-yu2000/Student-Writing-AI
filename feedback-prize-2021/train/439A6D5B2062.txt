Dear Principal,

We the students of SCHOOL_NAME should be able to pick if we want to have community service. If students hear don't want to do community service then we should not have to. You are the principal and why should we have to do something that we don't want to do. Ask yourself that if you did not want to do something while you where a kid then why should you make us do it?

As students we should agree or disagree with your opinions and if we don't like what you say we have the right to object it. So if you want to make new rules then we the students should really have a say into that. What if some stude

Yes community service would be nice but the reality is that people these days are very LAZY so we should have a choice on what we do after school. So we should know madder what we should have a choice. So if we the students don't want to do anything, but just go home an play video games and eat then fine let them get fatter but we should always have a choice in something.

From,

STUDENT_NAME 8th grade
