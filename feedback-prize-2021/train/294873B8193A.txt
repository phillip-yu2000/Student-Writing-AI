Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its danger of making it a challenge because there are great qualites about this planet that makes it different . One way Venus is analogous to earth is because it has a rocky surface,valleys,and mountains. A interesting fact about Venus that the passage states is that "its one of the brightest points of light in the night sky." Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density of size and occasionally in distance too. The article states that " A ship hovering over venus can allow very limited insight on ground conditions because of certain forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere." but when scientists figure out a way to create a machine that will work in those conditions it willl be worth the wait.

Venus is reffered to as earths twin. A big differnce between earth and Venus is that Venus is over 800 degrees and no one would last in that condtion of heat. Venus has the hottest surface even though mercury is closer to earth. There are many more things scientists can find out,if they keep studying Venus even though it is a challenge because of the high temperature. In conclusion even though Venus is a challenge to study it is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because of howmany differences it has from earth.
