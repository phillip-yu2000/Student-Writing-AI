The technology shows positives for human emotions. The Technology mesaures muscle movement, emotion, and how different emotions can be mixed with other emotions. Technology is changing the future to be exactly like a Human and be able to read a Human.

This Technology reads the Human body and muscle movements. the process happens when the Computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the Face and musle movements. The artical says this in paragrapgh 3 lines 2-3 "all 44 major muscles in the model must move like Human musles. The technology can sense six basic types of emotion. The technology will associate each movement of the muscles with the emotion that would match that certain muscle movement.

emotion is a big part of the human body and so are facial expressions. "Dr. Paul Eckman"and "Dr. Huang" have created a technology to read these emotions. These technology can read emotion from even people that show very low degree of emotion. The mona lisa created by Da Vinci was created to show human emotion. But the mona lisa isnt just happy because she is smiling. The mona lisa shows a whole bunch of emotions and this is saying is that any human can seem like they are happy or sad but really they can be the exact opposite.

Now the Doctors say that these techniology can read emotion but if we make a emotion does it really mean we have that emotion. The docotrs say that if you make a emotion it can even produce a real one. i think these technology would help todays society becuase it would help with seeing what other friends and family feel.

This technology can be very useful and i would like to see it used a lot. This technology tracks emotion,muscle movement, and change in emotion. emotion is a big part of life and the way people do there everyday life. In today's society emotion is a major difference to the way people act to one anither.
