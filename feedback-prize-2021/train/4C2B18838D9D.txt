Luke helped innocent people and now other people should to. Helping isn't just being nice. It is also about caring sharing and giving. Not disrespect, mistreat, and ignore.

All people deserve the same right. luke got injured and he had to rest for a couple days but he stil went on to finish the mission. He didn't even have an idea that his life was gonna change he just took the chance when it was offered and he never doubted it.

After the war he joined the UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration).Luke was only 18 when all of this happened. He helped out at his aunt Katie's ranch for most of his days when he was just a little boy. He helped with the enviorment and cattle and other animals at the places where ww2 took place. Alot of people died but not in his hands.

Brave people survived and never forgot the memory of ww2. Luke being a Seagoing cowboy was the thing that he was most proud of. It opened up everything and everywhere to him that made him feel awesome for helping out arround the world instead of just watching other people take his opportunity.
