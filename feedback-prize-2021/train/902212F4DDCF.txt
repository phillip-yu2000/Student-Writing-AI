Facial expressions a classmate gives towards other classmates could end with a " hey ! Want to be my partner ?" or " Meet me in the parking lot after school." When glancing around the class to check the time on the clock a classmate has no idea what facial expression they are making. It's difficult to detect an unharmful face of a classmate if they seem angry and ready to rumble , even though the classmate is actually just confused about the assingment that was given.

Dr. Huang has created the new emotion-recognition software for that humans can now have a better understance of how a person feels about certian topics. " The software can even identify mixed emotions." There will not be any more wondering or confusion with assingments that are dificult to some students. " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." The computer will then modify the lesson for the student , so he/she can comprehen the lesson. This will allow the generator to be like an effective human instructor.

The emotion-recognition software might be on the verge to help lower the sudicial rate in America or around the world. "If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen , a similar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different." If a person is prone to having destructive thoughts then the ad changing could imbue them to getting the help they need. This could also promote the person who smiles at the web cam to be more joyful and spread kindness to others.

Therefore , the emotion-recognition software will be an amuse help in schools and analyzing the emotions of a teen. Everyone could know what or how someone feels. This software can help inform an adult , teacher , or parent when a child is irritated by their surrounds , contemplating about harming their selves , or thoughts that could lead to serious mental issues or lethal consequences.
