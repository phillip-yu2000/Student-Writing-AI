Dear state senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME and i am here today to talk to you about wether or not you should keep the Electoral College. In my opinion i thibk that it would be easiewr to vote for the president by the number of popular votes that he recieves. In this letter i am going to explain to you why i think that its easier if we do this so please make sure you can read through this whole letter.

The first thing we need to know before starting to read this letter is that the Electoral college is basically a widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democractic mehtod of selecting a president that ought to be rules. Many people in the United States and in other places all over the world always face difficulties wether or not they like the Electoral College. If you acually think about it, in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for the slate of the electors who then vote for the president. So the people that are voting for these electors are not getting the direct vote. They are not getting sufficent amount of power to vote for the person that is going to rule their life.

A very important key that we asll have to know is that the electoral college is unfair for the voters. Candidates dont spend time on states that they know have no chance of winning. People cant put the fate of the presidency in the hands of a state that only have candidates because the candidates know that they might have a chance on winning!! And i do understand that we cant change this because some people dont like it but that is because people do not understand what the Electoral College is in the first place.

So dear mr.senate please do something to abolish the electoral college. Its is unfair and irrational. Thank you for taking your time to read this letter and dont hesistate to call me whenever you need to.

Sincerly,

PROPER_NAME
