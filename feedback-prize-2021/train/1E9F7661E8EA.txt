Dear Principal,

I don't think your new policy is fair. many students don't have

B average and it will take a lot for them to get there. If you change your policy, you will not have enough players for your teams. I think a C average is a better alternate. You can't expect students to maintain a B average for the whole year. It wouldn't be fair to the students or to the coaches. Some students aren't very good with their grades so they go to a sport to get away from that, it wont be fair to them if you make them maintain a B average or higher just so they can play. Many students have a C average and that should be good enough. Students have worked hard in order to get their teams where they are, don't take that away with a policy change. Students spent money on their equipment, if they don't get a B average or higher, it would have all been for nothing. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank You.

Sincerely,

Your students.
