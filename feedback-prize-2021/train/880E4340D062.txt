Extracurricular activity is like eating a rotten banana; is terrible. I disagree with the Principal, that students have to take a extracurricular activity. Some students don't have time, work after school, and it can damage their school grade terribly.

To begin, with why i disagree with the Principal that students have to do a extracurricular activity after schoolÂ or during school. Some students don't have time. For example they have to take care of their sibling, chores, and they have to do homework.

Also, why i disagree with the Principal that students have to do a extracurricular activity. Some students work after school. For example they work to help their parent, some students work to save up for college,and some students work for their future.

Lastly, why i disagree with the Principal that students have to do a extracurricular activity after school or during school. It can damage their school grade terribly. For example some students go for a

A to a F, students are hung up on sport that their don't get their work done, and students are so hung up on their extracurricular activity that their don't study for their test.

These are my reasons and my examples of why i disagree that students are force to do extracurricular activity.
