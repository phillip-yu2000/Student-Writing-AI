Dear Senator

The electoral college is good because if the state is small it has a large population. It can have more electoral votes than big state. it helps avoid run off elections. there is also the swing state with a winner take all.

So the biger th state dose not mean more electoral votes. It actily has to do population. the bigger the population the more electoral votes. So for example florida has 29 electoral college votes and montana has 3 electoral college votes.

It helps avoid run off election when nixon and clinton ran they each got 43 votes. So the popular vots helped the end resolt. It can make it to where a single vote candicide the election. To produces a clear winner.

The swing state method is when they candidates campaign in the toss up states. where the voters are more likkly to pay close attention to the campaign. The swing states can diside a election.

So in conclution electoral colage workes. because big states cant get the most votes. avoid run off elections. swing states are the states who pay most attion tho the campain. That is why the electoral college still workes.
