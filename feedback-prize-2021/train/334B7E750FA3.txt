Do you want an adventure of a life time? If you do then the Seagoing Cowboys program is right for you! Hello I am Luke Bomberger and I'm going to tell you all about why you should be a member of the Seagoing Cowboys program.

One reason you should join is that you travel around the world. You can see lots of historical artifacts and great tourist destinations. Once I saw a excavated castle in Crete. Does that sound amazing? Well that wasn't all I saw the Panama Canal on the way to China. Is that marvelous or what!

If seeing the world isn't enough for you then helping others should. You can help millions of people just two to four weeks trip at a time. People need all the care they can get. Almost everything was lost in the war, and we can hlep with giving them cows, horses, and more. If we give them these animal it will also give them hope.

I am sure that last reson should have sold you over, but just to make sure I'll give you one more. Caring for the animals. Who doesn't like animals? I mean come on they are just like us, living things. Being living things, they need tending to. Like food, water, and a friend. That friend could be you.

There you have it three great reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Oh, and I almost forgot that when you done with your job, and are heading home the whole crew plays games. Example would be like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, and a whole bunch of other games. If I were you I would already be saying "Deal!" Although it's your decision. What do you say worth a try?
