Some schools require that there students do summer projects, to make sure they are still learning over the summer. Some people believe that summer projects should be student designed, however i think that they are wrong. One of the reasons that i think they are wrong is because, if students design them there not going to learn anything from them. The students will just make up something very easy so they can get it done fast and get a good grade on it. For example they may make them something that is not school related, or maybe even something that is inappropriate for school.

I believe that teachers should design the projects. The first reason that i believe teachers should design it is because they will make sure that it is appropriate for school, and they will make it something that the students can learn from. The teacher has more education than the student. Another reason that i think teachers should design it, is because if the students had to design it they most likely wouldn't do it. Teachers are used to designing work for students.

If the students do the projects right when the teacher assigns them it will not take as long to do and they can get them over with fast,

and then they can enjoy there summer break. I believe if schools want the students to do summer projects then it would not be right to make the students design them. I believe that their summer break should be for them to enjoy not to be designing projects.

If the students design the projects, then it would be a mess. If the teachers design it then it will be better and more professional. They are the reasons that i think the teacher, not the student should design these summer projects.
