The world of technology is developing to a higher level everyday. From television to having a small computer that can fit into your pockets. We have evolved, so did technology.

Technology is important in our life. Without technology now, would be hard and not easy to live without. But we took it to another level that we can now tell people facial expression. I like the idea that they did but I honestly don't think it would matter or change the way kids are gonna feel in school. Reading students emotions in class would help the teacher or staffs know how the students are feeling, but that wouldn't change the fact that they are in school. Students that are giving work will most likely feel a little angry inside. Teacher and staffs should be able to tell if a student is happy or sad. Not all teacher or staff can tell, but just looking at the students mouth or orbicularis tighten around their lips should show that they are angry or happy. Work is never fun or will make a student happy in school. I'm against the value of using technology to read students emotion expression because to make it through a lesson plan, it wouldn't matter if the students is happy or sad or even mad. In the end we all have to pass the class and make it through whatever the teacher gives us. Even though the technology of knowing other people emotions is cool, there wont be a different on how students in school will change how they feel.

This is only a sample of new technology. There will be more advance technology coming. Without technology life would be difficult. From chalkboard to projector. Technology is a big part of human life and the way they affect us. From solving a problem on your phone or even searching things we don't know on the web. Knowing people emotion will change a lot of people and will surprise them.
