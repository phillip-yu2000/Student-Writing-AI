Dear Principal ,

I don't think you should allow the students to use there phones at school because phones just another distraction . If you decided to let the students to use there phones during school it would be a mess because students will always think about another message coming thought when they get in class .

Another reason why phones should not be allowed is because instead of paying attention in class the will try to sneak and text back whoever they where texting before they came into that classroom . They will not be doing there work every chance they get they will text other people .

Finally phones should not be allowed because students will cheat on test . When the student doesn't know the answer to the question he or she will text there friend and ask for the answer . Therefore the student is not learning and is passing off someone else's answers .

Those are some of the reasons why phones should not be allowed in school i hope that you see that this a major problems today with student and make the best decision .
