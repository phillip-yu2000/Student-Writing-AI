The technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can do a lot more than just read emotions to us now. It can help us understand each other, help us answer questions we didn't have the power to answer, and help us become closer as a species. The human emotion is very hard to understand, but once you do your life can become a whole lot easier.

First I think that the technology is valuable because expressions are one of the keys of understand ourselves and each other. In the artical is states, "The facial expressions for each emotion are universal," observes Dr. Huang, "even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression." I think expressions are a way to become a sentiant being to.

I also think its valubal because their are still lots of questons to be answered but can t because the lack of technology but most of it can be answered by just using this. In the text it states, "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." all of the words said in the text were all just based af a 2D photo think what we can do with a photo that's already 3 dimensinal.

Finaly I think that as a spices that amotions sre one of the thing that can hold us back or bring us forward in the future but that just a hypothosis of what i think. In the text it states, "Accoding to the facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them." Emotions are one of the keys to our future and it's to early to tell but hopefully it will be special.

The human emotion is very hard to understand, but with every thing that is said in the artical you can only hope the computer really becomes something special for all of us to observe.
