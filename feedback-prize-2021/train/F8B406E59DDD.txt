Cars,the thing that all teenagers want when they turn sixteen. Driving gives a sense of freedom, but it comes with a price. Diving automotives pollutes the air with greenhouse gases. Cities like Paris, Vauban, and Bogota have some serious problems with pollution. Thats why we should limit vehicle usage.

Vauban, Germany is doing it wrong, by living in a "car-free" envirorment. The citizens that live here forbidden to own a car, driveway, and a home garage. There is a glimpse of light to all of you that love driving or need to drive to work. In this city, if somebody wanted to own an automotive they would have to pay an additional 40,000 dollars and live at the edge of the city limit. Pollution might be serious but you should just limit the commute to work so citizens don't have to drive so much. Think about it, if you force people that have cars to live on the city limit, but they might work in the middle of the city. I don't see the solution in that.

Paris, France, the city of love, is also the leading city in Europe of smog. "passenger cars cause 12% of greenhouse gases in Europe." (Rosenthal 5).Paris is not so bad in book compare to Vauban. Paris has assigned certain days for the drivers to drive. On one day, even license plates will drive and the odds with drive the following day. There are precausions that they take if a odd driver drives on an even day. The drive will be fined 22 euros (that is 31 american dollars).There is nothing wrong with this plan exept if some one with an odd license plate has an emergency, and needs to take care of it posthaste.

Smog is not a good thing at all, and won't decrease until we do some thing about it. that a 'car-free" day and bike to where ever you need to go. This our planet and we should take car of it.
