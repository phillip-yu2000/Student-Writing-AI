Principal (last name),

With all do respect I am against your idea of not letting kids play sports if they are not on a B average. I don't think it's fair because a B average means "good". A C average is average. If a student has an average letter grade they should still be able to play or participate in sports. My reason is a student could easily fail in a class if they didn't care. But, if a student has a C average letter grade then it means that the student is showing that him or her is at least having to show some effort. Rather It's doing homework, doing good on test/quizzes, or even getting a decent grade on in-class work.

When you take away sports from students, you are taking away some students time to be active and express themselves. Also when you take away sports you could be taking away a students social time with peers. I am asking you to please reconsider your rule of letting students play sports unless they have a B average grade. Thank you for your time to read this letter

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
