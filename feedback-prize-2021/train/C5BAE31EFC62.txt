Are two heads actually better than one? Why might people seeking advice ask more than one person?

I think some people ask more than one person because, different people have different education, people differ from each other and it's important to see different viewpoints.

One reason why people might seek different opinions is because different people have different education.

Some people could've been taught different things or just know different knowledge in general.

There could be people who could have the perfect advice for you but then there could be someone who just doesn't know what to say.

People are taught different things everyday and asking more people might get you better advice.

Asking more than one person about advice is also important because people are different.

People are evolving and are just so much diverse from one another.

People are from different cultures, races, are different genders and more.

Asking different people for advice would get you a lot of different answers just because people are way more advanced and different then they were before.

My Final reason to explain why people seek different opinions is because it's important to see different viewpoints.

It's important to see different viewpoints because then you can have many different options.

Different options give you more to think about, and just more advice.

In Conclusion,

People seek different opinions because different people have different education,

people are just different and it gives you more viewpoints.

Different opinions allow for the brain to think more and see which solution the best.
