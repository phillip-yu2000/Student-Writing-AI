There are both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Though I believe why change what's not broke; there are many people out there who believe driverless cars are the future.

The positive aspects of driverless cars are as follows: there are sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes: these sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids, these vehicles have a traffic jam assistance to signal to the driver that it is time to take over to navigate work zones and accidents, they can steer, accelerate, and break themselves.

The negative aspect of the driverless cars are as follows: more laws would have to be created in ensuring whose liable for the accidents as well as keeping people safe, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars in many states, and to ensure the safety of pedestrians and drivers, traffic lawa will change and not just regular laws and least, they are dangerous.

So therefore, I say stick to what's not broke. The world is becoming lazy and there are certain things we need to keep to ensure safety for our citizens. The negatives outweigh the positives. The driverless cars sound just like what they are DANGEROUS!
