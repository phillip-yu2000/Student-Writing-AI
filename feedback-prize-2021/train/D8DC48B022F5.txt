When I go out and I look out my window I see people texting and driving. This is dangerous you don't look at the road and not paying attention to the road you could kill someone or yourself. The one thing that gets to me you see law enforcement on their phone while driving also.

There has been a lot of kids, teens and adults been killed using their phones. Either texting or talking on the phone. That message or call can wait until you get where you are going. Teens and adults should turn off their phones before they start the car. This could save your life and the life of others.

The law enforcement should also set good examples by not letting others see them talking and texting while driving. Parents also should set the example of not texting and driving. Some states have passed laws where it is illegal to have a phone in your hand while driving. I believe that all states should pass this law. Or have cars that will not start if it indicates a phone on or in use when trying to crank it up.

If they have a phone use the safe while not driving button. That way messages and calls will not come in and let others know they are driving and will call when its safe.
