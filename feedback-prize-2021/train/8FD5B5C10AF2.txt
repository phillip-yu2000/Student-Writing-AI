Dear TEACHER_NAME:

As a student with an all A average, I agree with you completely. Students should not be able to participate in sports or any other extra-curricular activities if he/she does not have at least a B average. I believe that if you do not try your best in class that you will not try your best on the field. Unfortunately, that is not true about some students.

Most of us young people try our hardest at what we do. Then again, most of us don't. I think that you should let students that try extremely hard in class be on a sports team if they are above failing, even if they are below a B. Our teams would be magnificent!

There are also some of the brighter students that do not like to play sports. I am one of them. I would willingly give up my Chief Time to tutor a fellow student. I also think that if we had more one-on-one tutors, more children would be able to play sports.

I hope you take my beliefs under consideration. I know of many honors students that would tutor. Thank you for caring about how the students feel.
