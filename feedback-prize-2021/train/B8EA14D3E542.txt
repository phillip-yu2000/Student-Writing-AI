Dear Principal,

I understand your opinion about the activity issue, but I think its unfair, but fair at the same time because its hard to keep a grade B average because we have a lot of homework. We have a lot of homework in advisory sometimes and even in our electives such as drama, Spanish, and Art.

Sometimes i cant finish my drama homework because i have Science, Math, English, History, and even Physical Education homework. It's also hard because in Science TEACHER_NAME gives a lot of homework and I forget about my other classes and that assignment that I missed brings my grade down. It's also hard because in Math we go over a chapter and the next week we have to take a test on it, it's hard to focus on the test when u have to study for your History test that's on the day before your Math chapter test.

I also think its hard because, say if you already have a grade B average and your the star player on your football or basketball team and you have a Science exam, Math quiz, and a Championship game coming up in the same week and you fail both test because you were going through too many problems and your brain couldn't handle all of it and you cant play in your game because your grade is now at a C grade average. All that i am trying to say is the reason a lot of people are at C grade average because the homework, but there are some people who just doesn't care about their grades but they will once they get mature enough to know this is getting you ready for your future and that's why i think its fair too.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
