Prompt-My prompt is explain to people why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice

Seeking muitipule opinions is a better choice beacsue you can get a bunch of diffferent opinions and they most likey will have a better point of view. Its better to have mutilple choice then just having one choice or opinions now for some examples Example one If a student is having issuse at home they have mutiple opinions which are 1. talk to a counsler 2. talk to the school social worker 3. talk to a trusted adult 4. talk to a friends parent 5. talk to other family members..

example two a lady haves a few job offers but he goes for one and thinks he not going to pass the interview but he stll has a few jobs lining up behind him the job offers are1. sceintest at nasa 2. host on the ellen show 3. a buisness owner.

I also feel like asking one person would not be the best choice bescause what if they dont have have the best opinions or best advice,i feel like for the bst advice ask more then one person make sure the person is trustable make sure the person knows what they are talking about.

To make sure this trusted person know what they are talking about ask them a few quetions iif they answer them right then they might be a person you can trust

If your the one taking to the kid or adult going having issues have patince with them its probroly a hard topic for them
