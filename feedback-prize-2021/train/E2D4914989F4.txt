To Principal

I think that it is wrong that kids with B averages get to participate in sports and other activities.

Why i think this is wrong because then C average kids wont get any exercise and that some C average students are good at sports, the school wont know that because they wont let C average kids play any sports or activities. Also some of the C average kids from the school will move to a new school, and i think the principal wont like that. So i would be mad if C average kids wouldn't be able to play any sports.

Also if i am on the basketball team and i wanted friend to join but he couldn't because of the school policy and that would make me and my friend sad. Also if i had a C average i would tell my mom to change me to a new school because that is not fair for others. Also if the principal did that he would be getting in a lot of arguments with parents and kids. So if i were principal i would not make this school policy because then it would make the kids sad.

Also it would make school sports boring because just seeing B average kids play rather than every average kids play is boring. Then by a month probably all C averages kids move to new schools so that means less kids and less pay for the teachers.
