The Electoral College is a process which is between a election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the popular vote of qualified citizens. Why do we need the Electoral College? We need the Electoral College to see what the people want in their opinion. Also, we need it for the problems the Electoral College avoids us from, such as each candidate doesn't recieve a majority of the votes cast.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, that wouldn't be fair. The people of the smaller states fell that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no sense of caring for their interests,like he really isn't their president. The bigger states, such as Texas, restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. So, as we can see a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state would.

Next, the Electoral College avoids us from things in many ways. For example, Nixon in 68' and Clinton in 92' both had a 43 percent chance plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Which means that pressure, which would greatly confuse the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which clearly states the winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president could turn off potential voters that has no hope for carrying their state. So the Electoral College greatly avoids run-off elections.

Therefore, we shall keep the Electoral College in favor for why we need to have it, and how it helps us avoid big situations. So please, let us keep the Electoral College as it helps our country throough political situations and for how it helps us.
