In this passage it is giving you information about Vauban's people, they do not use a car as transportation. In paragraph 3 Heidrun Walter states,"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," so an advantage of limiting car usage would be, that you are happier. Vauban in 2006, was an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use. Did you know passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intesive areas in the United States. With all that gas from the cars that is just causing more polution. Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. But its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessibleto public transportation, with less space for parking. In Vauban they are saying that they want to make walking to a bussiness or shoping center closer so they don't have to walk as far. Another reason why limiting car usage is a good idea, is that if you walk you get exercise which helps your body not just the Earth. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting "car reduced" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport. I believe that we should change those numbers around, and have more people doing what Vauban, Germany is doing and walking or riding bikes to the places we want to go.
