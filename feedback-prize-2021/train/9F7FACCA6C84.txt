There are very many pros & cons on why "Driverless Cars" would be a good thing.

I can name a lot of good and bad things about them. I am here to tell you my position, & to tell you pros & cons on this situation. These things can be very helpful in deciding whether these cars are a idea or not. Everybody may have different opinions on this situation.

Personally I think driverless cars could be good & bad. Here's why. Driverless cars could benefit a lot of people in many ways , for example if you are running late and you dont have time to do something before you leave the house you can do it in the car. On the other hand its a bad thing because they say the car tell you when it needs human assistance, but what if you're so busy doing the thing you were doing while you were runnning late you don't pay attention to the car telling you it needs your assistance. So before you know it you end up in a accident.

Some people think that the car isnt a good idea. They believe that "the only safe car is the one that has a human driver in control at all times". I see why they would think that . Considering the fact that all of this is running off of technology, who's to say that something horrible is going to happen. Technology malfunctions all the time , so what makes people think that these driverless cars are any different. So there's a problem with a car running off of technology. They say that they plan to have these problems solved , & a handful of car companies plan to have cars that drive by themselves in a few years, but they get closer to where they want to be with this everyday.

Thats how I feel on the situation of driverless/smart cars. Until they get all the problems under control & get everything to the point where no one has to wonder about what would happen in a certain situation, I think that they are a bad idea. They have good reasoning on why they should be made but the list of why they shouldnt overshines that.
