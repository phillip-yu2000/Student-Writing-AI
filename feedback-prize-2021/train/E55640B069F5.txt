Imagine your trying to decide on a hair color, Red, Green, Blue or Black? You have no idea. This is why sometimes you need multiple opinions on what to do. So you go around you ask friends their responses are all different you dont know what to do. So you have to find a another person to help you out.

Dying your hair a different color is not an easy task, you need to decide from the hundreds of shades and colors they have for you to use. Between simple colors like Blue, Red, Blue and Black. You need multiple people to ask what color you should get but, what if those people all choose different colors for you to use. This is why you need multiple opinions.

But guess what that person says the color you dont want to do. What do you do? Get more opinions or just give up? You keep going, you wanted to dye your hair in the first place so you need to figure out what your gonna do. You're gonna narrow down your list to less and ask 5 people again what color should I dye my hair?

After getting multiple opinions you are going to get your hair the color blue. Most of your friends said you should get it blue. They helped you settle what color you should dye your hair.

In conclusion, Getting multiple opinions is the way to go. Whether deciding where to eat where to go or what color your hair should be. Some of these are very hard choices and people should ask for multiple opinions not just one.
