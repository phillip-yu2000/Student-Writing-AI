Peoples opinion can vary wildly and some may say that your own advice is the best advice, but what if you have no idea what you should do and require advice from others, well some would ask a friend or family member and go with whatever they might say, but it is more beneficial too ask for multiple stand-points. When people ask for advice, they should ask more than one person because it gives more variety, you can see multiple stand points and solutions, more likely to get better advice, and it allows for you to make a better choice because multiple opinions will allow you to rat out any bias.

Since the start of humanity humans have always looked up to each other and for a good reason. Say that a hunting group of an ancient tribe was the first to take down a bear, the people of the tribe would wonder how they did it so they ask for advice from the hunters and the hunters shares their knowledge with the people and know the less experienced hunters will have a easier time hunting bear, all because of people with knowledge was asked to share their wisdom. This applies to the modern world too, as a example, say your big sister is a English major with tons of experience writing essays and other styles of papers, and you're terrible at writing large papers, you need help and ask your sister and they're happy to help, then, possibly, your essay becomes a whole lot easier all because of someone with important knowledge. Finally to show that multiple opinions (and/or the wisdom of those who are experienced) are better than opinions of a singular person, lets look at one last example (to cover as much ground as possible), say there is a person ,who does not have anyone to turn to, runs into a problem and has no idea how to handle the situation, they should ask around even if the people they ask can't help, they might just make a friend, as long as they keep asking someone with knowledge can help, more specifically their car breaks down and they have no one to call or money to pay for repairs. Then the person eventually runs into a mechanic and the mechanic is glad to help out and teaches the person about auto-repair and help fix their car. That person made a new friend, got their car back up and running, and learned skills that can be useful in the future and could help them get a job, all because they asked for advice.
