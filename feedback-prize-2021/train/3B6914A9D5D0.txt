Dear Principal,

Many ,many kids have cell phones and they are always on them texting, on the internet, or calling for really no reason. Now I think the students at your school should be able to use phones at school during lunch periods and other free time, as long as they are turn off during class time.

First off, I think the students at your school should be able to use phones at school during lunch periods and other free time because students might need to call their mom for something. Like one time at school I forgot my lunch and I didn't have a cell phone to call her so I went to the front office because they had a student phone to call your parents But there is only one phone and there was at least four students in front of me trying to call. So I waited about a half hour. When I got back to the classroom my teacher said I missed her whole lesson. So I had to go back to the front office to call my mom to tell her that i had to stay after school and get teach the lesson by my teacher.
