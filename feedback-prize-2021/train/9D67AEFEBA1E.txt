Why we should keep our cell phones with us during school

I think that the firs policy is better because as long as you are not distracting the class you shouldn't need to leave your phone at home. What if you have a family emergency that you don't hear about because you don't have you phone during lunch and free times. I think that we would all think the same thing as to why we need our cell phones because you might want to talk to your friends after school to find out where you are going to hang out and wouldn't be able to because you don't have your phone. if you need to know where to go after school and you wouldn't have a phone to talk to your mom or dad to find out where to go. when we are not able to contact our family we wont want to come to this school and would maybe switch schools because there is SCHOOL_NAME, SCHOOL_NAME, and SCHOOL_NAME

or some people will sneak phones in any way. So we need to keep our phones with us and if we cant then will either sneak them in or change schools.
