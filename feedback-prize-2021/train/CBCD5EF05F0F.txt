Do you ever think why do some people ask one than one person for advice? Some people may need to hear different side of advise. Or some people may need to hear different opionions. Some people see the things differently, so its not a bad thing to ask multiple people for advice. You miight even find someong that thinks the same as you and go with that. You might find some one that think totaly different from you and go with that. Its two reasoin why I would ask different peoople for advice to find out new things,and hear different opionions.

I needed some advice for a project so I asked my mom and my grandma. My mom told me how to do it and what to do. My grandma told me the samething so I ask my uncle. My uncle told me a lot that i didin't know so I was sure I was going to pass. Sometimes seeking multiple opionions can help someone make a better choice,.And you can find out new thing.

I might need different opionions then I might can put them together. People see thing differently so its better to get defferent sides of advice. You can ask a girl and a boy so you get the girls advice and the boys advice. I can better your chance of what ever your doing. Next time you need advice ask your mom and dad or your sister and your brother.

So you if you need some advice ask multiple people a boy and a girl. Like I said you may need different point of veiws. Seeking multiple opionions can help you make a better choice. And you can find out new things if its coming from multiple people. Remember my two reasions to find out new thing,and to hear different opionions.
