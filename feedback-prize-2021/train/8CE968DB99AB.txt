Dear Principal,

I am addressing the new policy that you are considering changing. The new policy of, any students who have below a B average, then they cannot participate in any sports or other activities. I think this new policy is unfair to most of the athletic students and coaches. Usually, a sports team has students with a C averages. They barely can play. If this policy is applied, then there will not be many players on a team. The players are stressed enough to play a sport and keep a C average. It would be too much of a struggle to keep up with all your work and play a sport. At least at a B average, it would be. The idea would have some of the players/students working on a class to keep up that grade but may forget about the other subjects, and go down in that grade.
