Phones and driving

Phones and driving is a terrible idea due to the amount of injury and danger it brings. Driving while occupied on the phone is a threat to yourself and others because your multitasking. This can cause risk because when your focusing on 2 things you may get distracted and forget about the other. If i am texting and driving and i glance down to read a text paragraph thats 3-7 seconds my eyes are off the road. Thats 3-7 seconds of disaster waiting to strike. All someone has to do is get over while im no looking or a light turn red then boom disaster strikes. And i can guarantee you that insurance won't be on your side in that situation.

In 2016 cell phones were responsible for 421,000 accidents around the united states alone. That's the equivalent of 5 dallas cowboy stadiums full. Out of that number 253 were fatal accidents. This was all in one year. The studies are evident occupied driving is a terrible and destructive habit that americans are responsible for starting. On average the american spends 24 hours week on their phones. Thats a day out of every week spent glued to a virtual reality.

So in conclusion i feel like phones should definitely be kept away from the river at all cost when on the road or behind the wheel in general.

It's too dangerous, too risky and more times than not whatever is on your phone can wait.
