I think we should be able to have cell phones on during class (Policy 1) . It's free time. It won't change our education. We could text our friends and ask them if we have any homework in the next class. If we forgot to do some of our homework, we can ask them if we check it today so we don't get detention. You wouldn't be able to ask your friends the answers to a test or the homework or anything like that.

If there would be a family emergency, we wouldn't be able to know about it. If we had our phone on, they could call us and we would know about it. We then wouldn't be left out. If a family member was about to pass away, we could talk to them for the last time instead of rushing to the hospital before it's to late.

If there was a gunman in the school, we could just reach in our pocket and tell the police where were at instead of having the phone in our locker and risking our life to get it.

Having the phone with you and on could save your life one day.

It could come to a simple thing such as missing the bus in the winter. Then you couldn't call your Mom to come and pick you up. You would need to walk home in the freezing cold. If you live far away from school, you would need to walk all the way home and risk being hit by a car if you have to cross a highway. Then you got your parents worried where you are and if your ok.

If we forgot our school project at home, we could call our parents to bring it to school so we don't fail the grade and miss the Honor Roll. Then we wouldn't have a failing grade for ourselves and if we have a partner. Your phone could help you both pass.
