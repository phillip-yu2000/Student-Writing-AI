I think driverless cars could be dangerous. A lot of people would probably think since they have driverless cars they could be on their phones, such as texting while on the road and not pay as much attention to the road because they wouldn`t have to control the wheel. Even though the car alerts you when its time for you to take the wheel, some people could not be paying attention and crash. Also for drunk drivers who could think since their car runs by itself they can get on the road drunk, no thats not how it works because at some point you would have to take control, and they could loose control and boom a car crash.

Another reason Im against driverless cars is because it would be pretty stupid to just be sitting in a car that drives it self. If your that lazy to not drive on your own you can just hop in a uber that can take you where you need to go. It can also be dangerous for young teens that don`t know how to drive who would also think they can hop in and get on the streets since the car drives by itself and wouldn`t need to do anything but just sit back and relax while the car drives itself. Perhaps how does the car even know where it`s going if your not controlling it ? i just dont think driverless cars are useful or safe.
