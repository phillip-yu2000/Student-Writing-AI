Fellow citizens should start limiting car usage. It can help the world more by less population and etc. Many countries had tried this and they think its a good idea. I mean it won't hurt to try it out. It can really have a good outcome. There are some advantages to this.

To begin with, there are thousands of cars in the world and it keeps on increasing, we'll have less traffic is we start to limit car usage. This is clear in source 3, it says "In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams." This shows that people can use other ways to transport to one play to another, they wont have to use a car and there will be no taffic any where. Therefore, its better to have no traffic involved you'll get to places faster then usaully.

Additionally, people stress alot over things and walking can help you stress less. In source 3, it says "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower pollution." This says this can benefit for you so yould't have to overthink things. Therefore, walking to your jobs, school, stores and any where you want to good can help you release stress.

Moreover, less teens will be getting license so there will be less car accidents.

This is clear in source 4, "A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009." This means that the less teens will get inyo car accidents which means the growth population will be increasing not decreasing. Therefore, the less teens get license the less accidents occurs.

In conclusin, there are many benefits in limiting car usage. Less pollution, no more traffic, less stress, and less teens will get their license. The more we do this the more we get use to it so we wont complain about anything. I urge you to stop using your car less because it will help you in some way.
