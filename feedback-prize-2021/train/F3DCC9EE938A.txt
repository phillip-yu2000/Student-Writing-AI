Dear Senator,

Im PROPER_NAME, writing you to ask if you could change the Electoral Collage, I'm sure I'm beside hundres asking for the same. Instead of voting for our slate of electors, we perfer to vote for the president himself. I have reasons, I will be glad to sure them with you.

In my opinion, I believe the Electoral collage is not fair. The bigger states get alot more electoral vote, So it's obvious if the president wins all the bigger states their going to win. The way I see it, is that the little states don't matter, or they aren't as important, since they got little electoral votes. For example, If I was running for president my main goal would be to win all the bigger states first, like; California, Texas, Florida. With them three states I already have 122 electrol votes, Thats when I'll start focusing on getting my other 148 votes by winning the little states over.

My other reason why myself, and hundres would rather vote for the president himself be, because of the mistakes of voting for the wrong canidate. Remember in 1960, Hawwii sent two slates of electors to Condress? What will happen?If you think about it anything and everything could go wrong!

Lastly,Voting for the president himself would be easier, You along with others in your range would not have to worry about the electoral votes. Not only that it may also be less stressful, and crazier. Voters like my parents would not get confuse for voting the wrong elector, and giving her vote to the wrong canidate.

In conclusion, I honestly think not having the electroal votes would be best for our voters. I'm sure the candidates would enjoy us the voters making the mistake and voting for the wrong elector, since at the end of the day the Canidate is the one getting the vote, that wasn't meant for him. Instead of voting for our electors, why won't we vote straight to our president?

Sinceraly,

PROPER_NAME
