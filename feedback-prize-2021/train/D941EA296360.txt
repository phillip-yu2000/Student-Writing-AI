Dear principal,

I agree with policy 1 because i say that is good to use our phones during lunch periods and at other free times but are phones have to be turned off during class time.

We should be able to use our phones and when we get back to class turn them off for we wont interrupt the class, our classmates, and our teachers. If after that lunch period is finished and other free times are done and we get back to class and if we don't have our phones turned off they could take our phones for not turning them off during class time.

What the teachers can do if they see that we have our phones on in class they could take them away, give it to the principal, give it to us after a few days or let our parents come and pick up our phones. The teachers could take them away and not give them back to us until the end of the day or the next day. If the teachers gives it to the principal we could fill out a paper where it says that we got our phone taken away and we have that paper filled in more than five times we cant bring our phones to school anymore. what they could also do is to give to us after a few days or let our parents come and pick it up to the office.

I think that our principal should gives us a chance to try this to see how we do. If it doesn't work well we will just go back to the way that was before. But i think that if we get the chance we will listen that the only time that we have to use our phones is during lunch periods and other free times. We will also now that when we go back to class we will have to turn off our phones before entering the class for we wont get in trouble or interrupt the teachers and our classmates.
