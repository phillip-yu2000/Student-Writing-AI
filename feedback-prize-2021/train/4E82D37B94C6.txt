While driveless cars a cooler driving yourself may be a bit more safer. Everyone knows a driveless car is awesome but has anyone ever thought about the cons of getting in a driveless car.

A driveless car are like a little computer so what happends when it fails on you.

Technology isn't always reilable. If the technology fails and some one gets injured who is to be blamed?

Cars still need human assistance for what they can't do. Some cars can steer , accelerate, and brake themselves , but no car can navigate you through work zones and around accidents. Why would we want a driveless car that can't drive its self? Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

Although driveless cars are cooler for humans safety should be our first certain. We as humans have more of a say so of who protects us and technology isn't always reliable. They're alot of things that can go wrong if some one is injured but no one to blame.
