I think that policy 1 is the best decision . The reason is because we will have the phones turned off during class, then we will turn them on when we eat lunch and at passing time. Another reason is we don't have that much freedom in school we have to go straight to class, we don't get to socialize during passing time. If you go with policy 2 we might need to use our phone for something important but we can't bring phones so you should go with policy 1. Kids won't abuse the rules because this is very important to us and we want to be able to text and get on the internet during lunch. Some people might not have friends at the school they go to so they might want to text else. We will do are best in school if we can have are cell phone because this will be the best thing that happened to us so far we don't get to go outside or nothing. A problem might happen at school and no teachers might be able to reach a phone they could use one of the students phones. Finally we would really appreciate this a lot because good things like this don't happen to us. We would not mess this opportunity up because we ant to be able to use are cell phones. Policy 2 just doesn't fit for middle or high school kids at all because we need that little bit of freedom.
