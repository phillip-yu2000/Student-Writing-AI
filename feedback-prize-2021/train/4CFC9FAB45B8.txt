While being able to tell someone's emotions can be a benefitial factor, it is also an invasion of the person's privacy. Many positive ideas come with being able to see how someone is feeling in a classroom, but there are some emotions that people just don't want other people knowing about. There are many different thoughts that go through a human being's head that therefore create the emotions that are felt. Students knowing that a computure is reading their every emotional status can create a very tense feeling and that could effect how the class lesson flows. There is no value in being ale to tell how a group of students are feeling in a class room.

Negative emotions are everywhere, which means anything can happen to anybody, so people can be emotionaly unstable. If a group of students in a classroom were to know that there is a computure that is telling the instructor that there is something wrong with a specific student, it can be imbarrasing. In the text it states " imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotion." That statement is an correct example of why computures that read emotions would be an invasion of every student's privacy. It's also justifying reason that there is no value in being able to tell how students are feeling because it is uncalled for.

The ariticle goes into futher explaining of how the new software in these computures are helpful and benefitial. Although it might be helpful in other ways than in a classroom, it shouldn't be used to collect information on how people are emotionally feeling without permission. Even with permission, emotions are a valuable part of humans that shouldn. t be taken for granted and used to collect data or research. For the value of emotions would be lost if a computure is using a software that reads the emotional status of the students in a classroom.
