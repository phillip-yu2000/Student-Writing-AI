Dear principle,

Community service should be a job, not for students to perform. Requiring students to do that job is very difficult, especially during school days. Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who don't have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service. And if the community needs some help as stated; take them in a specific day during school. But if it's everyday, community service jobs should be announced. That way students have some time and also learn community service during school.

Sincerely,
