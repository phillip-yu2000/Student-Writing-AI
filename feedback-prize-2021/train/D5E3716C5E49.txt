I think students should come up with their own summer projects design because, students can come up with really creative projects, could have more fun doing their own design projects,and will have less stress over the summer.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others.

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist. Students could also can work on a project with their friends.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist. Students can come up with their own checklist and show their classmates how they came up with it so the other students can do it one day for fun.

In conclusion, these our my reason why i think students should design their own summer projects.
