The "face" on mars was not made my aliens. We know this because it is only a Martian mesa, those are common on Cydonia. The only difference is that this one had shadows that made it look like a egyption Pharaoh. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, most of them thought otherwise. Photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyo. " we felt it was important to taxpayers," says Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAÂ’s Mars Exploration Program.

So we photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. On April 5, 1998 the first time that the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, Michael and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the Viking did. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first went on the web. Saddly enough it revealed that it was a natural landform. People were sad to see that it was not a alien moument after all, but some people still thought that it was still an alien moument.

They thought that because it was cloudy on the red planet the alien markings were hidden by haze. Neverthless, on April 8, 2001 on a couldless day the we tried for a third time, but " its not easy work, in fact, it's hard work," says Garvin."We had to role the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view."It was not all invain we got a great shot with each pixel in 2001 spans of 1.56 meaters, compared to the 42 meters per pixel used my the Viking. The picture was so good that if there were airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyrmids, or even small shacks they could see it all. What the picture really shows thr Martian equal to burra or masa. Land forms common around the American West. All it was, was a a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars
