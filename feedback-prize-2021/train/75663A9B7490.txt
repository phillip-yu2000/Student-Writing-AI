Dear principal,

I think that the students should be able to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch and there free time , just as long as they have turn them off during there learning time. You should really look into this and think about it before you make a digestion ,and here are my 3 reasons why you should allow the students to use there phones during there free time and lunch , 1st reason is that if you let then use it during lunch there will be less fights because there going to be to distracted on there cell phones and there will be less drama and it will be easier on not just the students but also on the teachers ,2nd reason is kids would want to come more to school knowing that they will be allowed for them to use there cell phones that why a maritry of the students don come to school is because they know that there cell phone will be taken away and sometimes is there 3rd time getting there phone taken away and they don't want there parents to find out that they were texting during class instead of paying attention in class ,because there afraid that there mom or dad is going to take away there cell phone until there grades get better. 3rd reason is that the cell phones are like teenagers babies so if they can take them out during during there free time and during lunch there will be less problems at this school , you should really think about this lets just say that if the students get to use there cell phones that the teachers wont have to worry about any fights happening during lunch so the teachers could take a break from all this drama like i know that the teachers here want a break from all this drama and that could happen if you just let us use our phones during our free time and our lunch time. that way all the staff and also the students can take a break from the drama that goes on here and in my opinion i think that we all want a break from all of the drama that goes on here at all the middle schools. many people think that
