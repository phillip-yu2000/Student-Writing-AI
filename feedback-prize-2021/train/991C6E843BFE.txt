The face on Mars is just a natural landform. There is no facts showing that it is not just a landform. If aleins were to build this landform we would have been aware of it.

The Mars face is actually a messa which are common sight in the American West. So this is strong proof that it is actually just a natural landform. If there was something out there like aleins which would have been proven to be real by now we would have proof of there existince then that could be another explanation but since we have no proof that they exist then we quikley ruled out that as a option

We knew as soon as the pictures where released that the critics and media would go go crazy on Nasa. Of course we know that theres people that are going to think Nasa is hiding information from the public but if there was life on Mars we would people to know that. When all the pictures came out they made a bunch of money. The face has actually become an pop icon. So if there was life on Mars we would want to share it with the public.

If the face wasnt a natural landform what is it then thats what i would like to know. Dont you think if it wasnt a landform we would want people to know we could make billions! For some people to think we're hiding something is crazy. There is proof that it's just a landform and that's is what all of us at Nasa have been saying for a long time now. That's why you should think it's a natural landform!
