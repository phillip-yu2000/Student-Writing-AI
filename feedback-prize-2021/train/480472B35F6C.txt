Citizens of the united states should participate in the "Seagoing Cowboys" program. First off they are sending animals such as horses, young cows, and mules to the coutries that were debistated from world war 2. Also they get the benfit of seeing Europe and China. Last they are serving for the orginazation of UNRRA. And this people is why you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program.

To support the reason that they get the benifit of seeing Europe and China. They see most of Europe. They see most of China too. And they see what most ordinary people don't get to. This shows why people should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program.

And to support the reason that your serving for the orginazation of UNRRA. They are part of the UNRRA . The UNRRA stands for (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). And so they are helping the debistated countries of Europe and China from world war 2.

Last to support the reason that they are helping others in need of animals from the debistation of world war 2. They are giving people animals. They are also giving people their needs. And from those animals they are getting people the products they need.

And I see why people do not want to join the program. maybe they want to stay with their families, or they get sea sick, or the fact that they just don't like animals.

In conclusion this is why people need to join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program. Like I said, they are sending animals to the countries that were debistated from world war 2. They also get the benifet of seeing Europe and China. They are also serving for the orginazation of the UNRRA. Now I recomend you should join the "Seagoing Cowboys" program.
