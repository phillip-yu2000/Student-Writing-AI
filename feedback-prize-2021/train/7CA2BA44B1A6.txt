Dear Principal,

I am writing you this letter to tell you my opinion on the new rule for sports. I think that having to have a B average to participate in a sport is unnecessary. Many students work hard to get a C average and are interested in playing sports. The idea that you need a B average to play a sport is wrong. There are many students are interested in playing sports in the school and having a C average is sometimes very difficult. If you change the average for the sports there will be much less people on the teams because of the fact that a B average is pretty difficult to obtain when you have to think about so many things on your mind at once. The responsibilities of being a higher level student are getting more in depth and as a student you cant have to worry about trying to keep and above B average and being a good teammate. You will also be loosing many students who for some reason cant keep a B average and may have problems at home or maybe even in school. So that certain persons grades may be falling a little short and they cant think straight. But then if they have to worry about keeping their grades up and other problems that they may encounter as a teenager would just be too much on their mind. There may be more troubles with parents also. If a student is very excited to start to play a sport but doesn't have the required grades then it would be sad for them to have to be let down by the school after being so enthusiastic about starting that sport. So it is a bad idea to bring up the required grade average to a B instead of a C. I hope you take this to mind for it is a very sought after subject that shouldn't be changed.

Sincerely,

Student
