dear TEACHER_NAME.

helping the community is very important to the environment, and it helps to make a better living. i believe you make the right choices to our campus. but most us "the students"

cannot be able to do this type of work after school. unless is during school time? for example: i have to go work after school, do chores in my house, take care of my brother, and maybe just do my homework. i can help you think with some ideas? you can predict them to help us increase a better environment!? ideas: ask who and who can help out, who can stay after school, or maybe write a letter to their parents and ask them? maybe make them sign an agreement?

i just hope most of my friends in school can help out.! because no matter what i will be there to help out on our community.

sincerely 8th grade student, STUDENT_NAME!
