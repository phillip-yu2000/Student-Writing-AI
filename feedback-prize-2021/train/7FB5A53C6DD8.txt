Seeking advice can be hard, but if you want the best advice, you can ask more than one person. Ask your parents or relatives at home for their best advice for you to make you be you. People look for advice to make themselves a better person.

Getting more opinions than just one can be helpful sometimes. People get opinions to help each other. People help one another in school, at home, in public, anywhere, it just depends on their character. If people get advice they can improve their grades in school to help get a better education. People will help you all around the world if you talk to them about what you think you're doing right and wrong.

Seeking multiple opinions about certain things will help you learn better and get taught the best way possible. Certain people don't care about their education in school, so they do other things and get bad grades. Seeking multiple opinions helps people in many different ways. Some people do and some people do like advice. Some people take the advice to heart like we're trying to hurt their feelings or somewhat.

When people give advice, they can give you good and bad advice for you. It all depends on the type of character you are, and what the type of person you're talking to is. People seek multiple opinions or advice to help their skills in life. If you want advice though, I'd suggest talking to a relative. Talking to a relative will most likely give you the best advice for you and yourself, because they're related to you.

Altogether People have different opinions on different ideas. We all help on another to be better in life, to be the better person. As long as you help other people they should give you the help you need.
