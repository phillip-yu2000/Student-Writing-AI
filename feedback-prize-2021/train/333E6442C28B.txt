The author finds that studing Venus would be a good thing because of how it is or was similar to earth. There is evidence of Venus being largely being covered by oceans as weel as mountains and valleys with rocky sediments this may give clues or refrences about extraterestrial life that humans have been looking for. Even though exploration on the surface of venus may be near impossible for humans, machines may be able to explore a given time on the suface of Venus colecting samples from things like rocks.

Venus has analougous features that are similar to Earth and this may lead to certain discoverys about the potential of life that may have survived on Venus. Since Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth it makes reaching Venus easy but that dosent mean it is like our planet becuse of the atmosphere letting all of the heat inside. If we are able to explore Venus then it may give us confidence to expore other planets that may be like Venus. Finding other lifeforms of materials other than what is already on earth may be huge to humans and give us a boost in what we know as well as have.

This is why exploring Venus may be benificial to scientists to make any discoverys that will help the human race and possibly find another planet that sustains life or another planet to live on. Finding clues on Venus about the past may prove as a good thing as well possiblly telling us if planets go through phases where they can sustain life and when they can't. There may possibly be remains of a civilization on the other planets that we do not know about.
