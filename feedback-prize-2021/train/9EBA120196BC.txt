I agree this decision because, if kids are bored they could do activities after school. Or learn different things about the things that the principal said. It said that you can participate on the year book. So you can also help those people by finishing the work they have left. And you participate on sports for example doing exercise and learning how to play that sport. And everybody can serve the student council. And after trying one of those you might like it. And you might want to join one of the activities. Or there might be more than one activities so you can try. "So go try the activities and learn those new things that your learning and I'm sure you might like them and maybe you might join one of those activities." I might even fo them because I want to learn new stuff to because if I get a job that might help me in life or in the future.
