Driverless cars could go both ways. They can be useful or just a waste of time. I think there should not be driverless cars. There should not be driverless cars because driving is a huge responsiblity. I feel that even if the car has an in-car enterainment the driver will not be paying attention to the road and when the car signals for the driver to take control, the driver won't know what is going on and could even cause an accident. Leading to the conflict of who is at fault, "the driver or the manufacturer?"

If we just keep our cars how they are now people will have to pay attention to the road. You could be paying really good attention to road but you have no idea how the other cars are. A lot of car accidents could be prevented if the driver of the car is in control at all times. People trying to invent a safe driverless car are just wasting their time.

Even if the car has a lot of safe reasons in why we should have them there will still be reasons why we shouldn't. We have had total control of our cars for the lonest time now and I feel like it is better to just play it safe and keep doing what we have been doing. It's better to play it safe than to be sorry.
