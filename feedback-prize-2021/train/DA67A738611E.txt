Dear Principal,

I do not like your changes you have made. There are many students that do not have a B or better most have a C or below. A C is an average grade for most students. If you just let people with a B or better than you will not have many people on the teams. Yes i do see why you would want to change. because if you change the people with a grade lower than a B would try to get the grade up and keep it there but is not fair for all the students because some students are smarter than others because not everyone is smart. Some people are better than others there will always be people that are better at sports than others and then there will be people that are better at school. But no mater what the will be some people that will never get there grade that high enough to play sports and i am not saying that all the smart people in the world are bad at sports. Just most of the time, the people that can not get there grade up is a good athlete.

There are people that don't have a B or better and they are good at other things besides sports. Like art club, FFA, FCCLA, and so much more. Some school don't let there students be in that stuff unless there grade is a B or better and that's not right. There is probably more than half of my grade that is better at sports or a group that cant because of there grade. I guess what i am trying to say is that if you change the policy that we will not have that many people on the sport teams or the groups so please don't change it or there will be a lot of upset people.

Your Student,
