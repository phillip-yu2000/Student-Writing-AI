Autonomous cares have been dreamt of for several generations now. Theyve gone through multiple changes and theories but we've just now found one solution that may be the key to the next generations of cars. In 2009 tech company Google revealed that it was working on a self driven car. However, despite this being in the works for over 9 years it still has its faults so some are sceptical about its rise to being the new standard. I however see differently.

Many people believe that these autonomous cars are highly dangerous to the public. This is not true, The self riven car from Google has only witnessed one crash in its lifespan. That crash was caused by another driver. Given this information it is true that car should have been able to have a counter menouver to this. So if everyone were to be using a car like this on the otherhand there would be no need for these types of menouvers to take place.

Now, others will think the cars to be completely impractical in todays society, but this is in fact false. The autonomous vehichles will only consume roughly half the fuel we do today, meaning we will cut back on our dependence for fossil fules such as gasoline. Since they dont require a driver in most situatiuons it will allow the driver to multitask while in the car which will be a great benefit given todays busy world. Better still is that they come equiped with high grade sensors to sense oncoming dangers and can move or speed up if it needs to without having the attention of the person inside it.

So am i for the autonomous cars? i absolutely am. With the cut of fossil fuels and the safety thats provided when in one who would want them to stop? They will make everyday life more simplistic and much more safe.
