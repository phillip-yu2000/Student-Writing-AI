Dear principal,

Here is what I think about having every student participate in community service. I think you should not have everyone participate in community service because of several reasons. First, some students have to babysit siblings or neighbors, community service will not allow them to do this, and some parents will be angry at that. Another reason is sports, many students participate in sports after school and cant skip games or practice, because the coach and parents will be mad. The last and most important reason is homework, this will not only angry the parents but the teachers as well. Students wont be able to complete all their homework assignments if they have to participate in community service. a solution to this is to have a certain selection of students that have bad grades and let them do community service as a form of extra credit, how can a student or parent e angry at that, you are bringing their grade up. another possible solution is to have a survey of kids who do nothing after school, and make them do community service. kids that don't do anything will most likely be happy if they have to do community service, 1 they're helping the community, and 2 they're being productive. That is what I think about all the students doing community service, and please take some thought on your decision. Think about the students and their parents when you make your decision.

Yours Truly, fellow student
