Dear Mrs. Principal,

I agree very much with your decision to only allow students with a B average of higher play sports. If students must have higher grades they will try harder in class, be proud of themselves, and help increase the school's grade average.

This policy would be beneficial to students who love sports but do not care as much about their grades. These students would know have to have high grades in order to do something they love. If students who have higher grades are playing, then we may have a better chance of winning, because smarter people think faster.

I

believe that the better our sports team's grades are the better they will feel about themselves. Sometimes the only thing that keeps a losing team going is that they are proud of themselves. The teams that win are full of pride before, during and after the games. If we make our players increase their average they will be proud and they will have to keep that average to be able to play a sport they love.

If we make our players increase their averages, this will reflect well on the school. When the school board looks at the average of the grades at our school our average would increase because extra curricular activities require higher grades. If we had a higher grade average our school would be looked at as a better school, we might get awards, and we would be a generally better school. If the school were to get awards, this accomplishment would improve school wide morale.

I believe that making students have a grade B average or higher to participate in extra curricular activities is a good idea because it increases the school grade average, make the students try more in class, and the students become proud of themselves for their grades. When we look at all the good this policy will do, we know it is the best idea for the school.

Sincerely,
