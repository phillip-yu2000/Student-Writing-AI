I think the reason people ask multiple people for advice. My reasons are 1. It might help them make better choices in the decision they are trying to take.2. It could give them a broader view on things.3. You might want to see if ever thing that the one person said would be the right thing to do. Lets get in to the reasons why i think people ask for advice from multiple people

Reason one. If you get advice from multiply people about a job or what college you should go to. The person asking wants to ask a lot of people because. they want to know why should i not go to these school or why should i get these job. They dont really know what they want thats why. they ask multiple peoples advice it will give them a better view on what they should do. When i ask people what do you think that i should do you think i should go to this or not go thats getting there side of view.

Reason two. It could give you a lot broader view or better prospective on things. Some times people will ask multiply people because. they want to see both sides of things they dont want to be tunnel vision on one idea. When someone is just tunnel vision on one idea. they usually dont make the best desion because they cant see if they like the other side or not.

Reason three. If one person tells you to go to something and your not so shore what would you do. Would you do what the person told you to do or would you ask around. I know i would ask people what i should do because if you dont and you make a bad dession that could ruing your life for ever. So that is why people ask more than one person about a idea.

These are the reasons why you should ask multiply people about a topic or a choice in life. You dont know may the one person you ask might set you up for a road. that could make you a millionaire or it could set you up to a path that you might not want to go down. which is OK you should hopefully learn from your mistakes.
