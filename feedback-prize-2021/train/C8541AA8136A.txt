I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to go places you probably have never been to, and explore them in your free time. You get to see countries that might feel special to you. You get to help countries recover food supplies, animals, and more because of wars.

You have to take care of the animals by feeding and giving them water two or three times a day. Also, you have to clean stalls, move hay bales and bags of oats. I once served as a night watchman, and you may think that it is boring, but you get to check on the animals a few times to see if they are alright. You sometimes can risk yourself working the nightwatch in the rain because I slid down a ladder, and cracked my ribs. It is still a fun job because you have a lot of free time, and you can play volleyball and baseball games. To pass the time from returning the trips after the animals had been unloaded, they would have table-tennis tournaments, boxing, reading, fencing, games, and whittling.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an adventure, but also teaches you that other countries and their needs. My family helped people by hosting a number of exchange visitors, and a number of international students. You should be a Seagoing Cowboy because it's hard work, but it pays off on the beautiful sights you will see.
