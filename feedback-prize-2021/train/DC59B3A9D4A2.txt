Ther are 3 main supportive reassons why this "face on mars" is just a natral landform. One, there is a posibility that the face is just a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"-paragraph 3. Two, if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide"-paragraph 5. Three, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

First of all there is a posibility that the face is just a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"-paragraph 3. I believe this beacuse NASA does not come across it veary often. Therefore, every time NASA did see the face then they might of just cought the rock formation at the right time, therefore cetching the right light. In a better picture taken in 1976 by Viking 1 you can clearly see shadows wich might be the scource of the face formation.

Second if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide"-paragraph 5. I think this very much makes sence because if it were evidence that would be somthing surely to keep out of the media. If there were other evidence of life on mars then why would NASA let just one piece of evidence out if it could easaly be mistaken. Then you would have a fake story going around that could possibly spark tension between countries for lieing about life on mars.

Third, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa. A butte is a lava bome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Therefore creating a figure that, with the right light, will creat a face loking feature. Also since a better picture was taken it would be easeier to "discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size". "So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"-paragraph 11
