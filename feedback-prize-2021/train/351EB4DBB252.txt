My opinions are if the students have wife access from their homes i think that they can attend classes from home. That is the best way to do some work for example projets or homeworks if their teachers give them to do. Also i think that students would benefit because there is something they may be learning how to get it done, and they will have time free to work on it. For the video confering most of the students don't like to do too much work because they are lazy sometimes, and they prefer the easy way to get it done quickly.

I know why i say all this because i am a student, and i also know how things work when we have some classes online. most of students feel great, and some of them don't like to work on it at home. For me i will say that it is better to achieve in class. let's just say that it is better idea to be focused on what you have to do.
