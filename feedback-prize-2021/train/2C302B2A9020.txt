Dear Principal

I know that many students don't respect the school rules. They are using their phones during class instead of putting attention, or people steal their phones and etc,. and just wasting money buying one and another.

Its better to do not allow students to have phones at school, so they can put more attention to class. But what happen if its an emergency and a student didn't bring his phone because his school do not allow cell phones?

He has to call his parents so they can pick him up because they don't know at what time to pick him up because sometimes he has tutoring sometimes not, or maybe they are busy or in another close city. He can't enter to the school to call his parents because the school its already ended, for some reason, like here in my school that they do not allow students to go in after school ends. He can't call his aunt, uncle grandma even his parents, Why? Because he doesn't have a cell phone. What would happen to that student? So then, where is he going?
