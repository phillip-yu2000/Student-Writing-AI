Does asking more than one person for a advice make it a better choice? I believe it does help but that can change depending on who you ask. Let's say that you need help with a personal question, who are you going to ask your best friend or a stranger? Probably your best friend because you can trust him and think his answer is better than your own.

But lets say they are all trust worthy then is it better? Yes it would be better to ask all of your friends to get the best answer. But you may value peoples answer more then others. Like you will probably value you best friend more then someone you met 5 days ago. But would you trust someone who tells peoples secrets more then the person that never talks? You probably trust the guy who never speaks more because the guy tells peoples secret will just everyone what you asked. But if it is not personal then it would be fine to go and ask everybody and find the best choice you can do.

In the end it is a good idea to ask everyone for advice as long as it is not personal. But if it is personal then get a group of trust worthy friend and ask them instead. Like it would be better to ask a small group of good friends if it is personal like how to ask out a crush or what to get a crush a present. But it would be fine to ask anybody how to cook pancakes or how to teach a dog a trick.
