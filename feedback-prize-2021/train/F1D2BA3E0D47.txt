Dear principal,

I believe that policy 1 is far better than policy 2 because the students should be able to use their free time however they want to use it and allowing cell phones is a good idea. It gives the students more freedom to use their free time the way they want to use it and I think it helps make school fun for the student body. Also if they must speak to a parent or a guardian about something they have the chance to do it if cell phones are allowed. Honestly, I don't see any harm in using policy 1 if the cell phones are turned off during class time. I am also sure that the students will follow policy 1 entirely and turn off cell phones before class.

Surely, most teachers already know students carry around cell phones so I don't expect this to be a drastic change and I don't believe the teachers mind, in fact I have seen some teachers answer their cell phones during class. I hope you will choose to use policy 2 instead of policy 1.
