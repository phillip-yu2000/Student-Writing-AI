To TEACHER_NAME,

I think that a kid shouldn't half to have at least a b average because then a lot of kids wouldn't play sports well I wouldn't.

The reason I think we shouldn't have to have a b average is because some kids that love sports my try very hard but just cant keep a b average so i mean there's no reason to have to make straight b + all the time because so of us kids just cant.

Another reason I have to support this is that you should just have to make passing grades to play if your doing that then you should be good but not making like d all the time like from a c + to a + should be good enough to play sports at school at least i think it should be like that.

The last reason I think you shouldn't have to have a b average is because so kids that like playing sports a lot just get distracted in practice and when there games are and were there at and what time they are and they just forget about having to keep a b average in school there more worried about making there school proud and wining the games.

In conclusion i hope that you read this letter and really think it through because its the truth and a c is still passing its just a little bit lower then a b so its still okay .
