My opinion is that Driverless cars should not be driven on the roads because one they eventually crash after they have been driven a certain amount of miles. These cars are not even truly driverless, forexample uu have to pull them in and out of driveways take over when the car is in traffic. The driverless car is truly useless because the roads arent fit for this car unless they have have the special message Binary code, The binary code allows the car to drive on the road.

Some more reasons to why i think the car should not be driven is because the car still needs a driver. The car is illegal in most states such as, California, Nevada, Florida, And the district of Columbia. They are illegal in these staes because they are not reliably safe. In the passage it says still, even if traffic laws change new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer.?

This car is not safe to pedestrians because if the car were to loose to control and the person in the car isnt able to take control quick enough then the pedestrian and the car owner would be hurt. Alas this car should not be driven because it needs too much work done on it such as, better sensors more magnetic sensors.

Inconclusin these cars should not be driven because they are dangerous and can harm somebody. They do not have all the materials this car need and they cant really be driven driverless because of all the malunfunctions which would stop people from buying the car because if they found out that the car has as many problems as it does they arent gonna want it which keeps them from recievimg money.
