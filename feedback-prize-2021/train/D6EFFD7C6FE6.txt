The face found on Mars is just a natural landform. It is considered a natural landform because there is no proof that aliens made it. We also have yet to find any type of life form on Mars. They have investigated this face since 1976 to 2001.

There is no real evidence or proof that an alien made that face on Mars. It was first noticed in 1976. It could have been there way before then. Its a natural landform because as the planets move around the sun that could make the land make any type of shape that no one has any control over. There is also no proof that aliens are real either so it could really be from anything.

When NASA first spotted this face, they didn't have the best cameras back then. Once it got to the media everyone was coming up with there own theories about how the face got there. NASA caption noted it as a "huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth." Thhe public took it out of hand and said it was created by aliens and didn't have any real evidence.

On April 5, 1998 when they flew over the planet for the first time and got a sharper picture of the face, the picture revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no evidence or proof that an alien made it.

In conclusion, the face found on Mars is just a natural landform formed by shadows and gives off illusions. It was most likely formed because of the planets spinning on the axis around the sun. The sun and other weathers, such as rain and snow can cause the land to form into anything from erosion or deposition.
