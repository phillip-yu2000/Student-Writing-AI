Dear Mr or Mrs Principal

I have heard that you may be considering letting the children have cell phone at and during school hours. My personal opinion on this is that student should not have cell phone at school for many reason. for example it a decisions it may cause student to cheat on test and finally way do u need cell phone at school anyway your friends are at school.

I Think that cell phone should not be at school for many reason but one reason would be why do u even did your phone at school when your friends are their. what I don't understand is when cell phone are such a problem at school. I know kids think they have better plans then school but i think they should have some thing to decision them also .

Cell phone shouldn't be used during school because their many thing u can do to get your self in trouble. Cell phone been the number one thing that get kids in trouble at school the reason for this is because student are texting in class. which make no nice to me I mean if its that important then it can be told out side in the hall way.

what student don't realizes is that we don't wanted to be mean to us student but we just don't wanted any cheating on test. I once read this article about this student who had big dreams and was going to try to change the world but one day she got wrote up for cheating on a test by texting this other student with the answer to that test. Of course she didn't get any point but not the way to start off trying to save the world and making it a different places.

So Mr. or Mrs Principal as much as it would upset the other student i think that we should not have any cell phone at school. I believe that their is not any use for them at school. I mean your friends are here, it cause people to cheat, and lastly its not the best way to use your spare time.
