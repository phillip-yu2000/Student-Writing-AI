Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that Policy 1 is better.

I believe that this policy is better because; one, it gives the students to have a "free" time and to be able to get their minds off all of their school work and it gives them a chance to communicate with other people, and two, I believe that having a cell phone out during a lunch period does not interfere with how the students learn.

Policy 1 would let the students have more freedom then they would normally have and I believe that when students get to have freedoms, like this one, they will behave better because they will not be trying to sneak and check their phone during their class period.

Whenever I see a student checking their phone during class time, it does distract me and I believe that if students would be able to use their cell phones during other times throughout the school day, then they would be less likely to try to use their phone during class.

Policy 2 doesn't let the students have any freedoms with their cell phones, and when students know that they don't have any privileges with their phones, they try to get away without anyone noticing them using it.

Although most students listen to the policies when it comes to their cell phones, some just don't.

Most of the students listen because they either don't want to get their phone taken away, or they don't care that they can't use their phones during the school day.

Then, other students don't care if they do or don't get caught using it.

I would like you to consider my thoughts and ideas about the cell phone usage during the school day and maybe also consider changing the policy.

I appreciate you taking your time to read my letter.
