Dear TEACHER_NAME,

2/15/11

I heard that you were considering two different policies about cell phones on campus.

Many students are going to be happy that you are considering to change the current rule about cell phones, but I think that the second policy is the way to go.

No cell phones of campus is the best for many reasons.

First, they are extremely distracting because if we are aloud to have them, that is all we will be worrying about.

I know, personally, that my cell phone can make me a different person.

Texting can be addicting, as most teenagers will tell you, but if you allow us to have phones on campus, we are likely to be on it all the time.

Some will say, "I can get away with it" or "the teacher won't even know."

Nine times out of ten, if we have them at one point of the day, they are likely to stay with us and not be put away when they are supposed to be.

Second, many teenagers can be bullied over the phone.

One kid will act like he is someone to else to trick another, and that will turn out to be bad because that person was not who they said they were.

Another reason is that if there are two people who don't like each other, and one of them gets a-hold of the other's number, they can say extremely mean things.

Finally, cell phones are to much of a distraction for us to be aloud to have them on campus.

I hope that you take my opinion into consideration and help it influence your decision.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
