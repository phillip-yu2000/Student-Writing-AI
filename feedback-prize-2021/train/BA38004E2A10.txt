After school activities would be good for kids of any age or education level. Students would rather go home and play video games, but I think staying in shape and making friends is more important. Sports and extracurricular activities can make you happy, you can learn new skills and information, and you can make friends that share your same interests.

Whether you play sports or do a club, you like that activity. I do cheer leading. I really like it because I have fun at football games and we do impressive stunts for basketball season. Clubs can participate in competitions and win prizes, just like sports. Some people like to compete so maybe doing a sport or club would be fun to you. Doing things that make you happy are very important!

If you sign up for things you like to do, then the other people signing up for that same activity share a common interest with you. With the four years that I have been cheering, I've made so many friends! Having the same likes with someone else can make it very easy to be friends with them. If you are able to communicate with others, then you can make friends.

If sports and exercise just aren't your thing, then join a club! A lot of people don't like sports and prefer do do other activities, maybe that's you. I did an after school club called Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA). I had fun and made friends there, too! More importantly, I learned some very valuable information for owning your own business. Cheer has taught me some important skills also; how to work as a team and how to get loud!

Out of school activities can be informing, friendly, and happy. If one or the other isn't for you, there's always another option. In conclusion, schools should have students participate in after school activities. Every student should have the opportunity to join a club or play a sport.Â
