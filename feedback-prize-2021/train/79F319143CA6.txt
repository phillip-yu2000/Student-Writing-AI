Technology able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because we could detect different type of moods even by making faces that wouldn't necessarily indicate a certain mood just by looking at their face. This sort of technology can benefit in more way's as well such as helping video game designers make their graphics more realistic and having characters resemble actual and more expressive moods.

Reading students emotional expressions can determine how they could possibly feel and perhaps help them out if they're feeling low or having a bad day. A simple computer program could tell if a student is in need of help by determining if the student is in a state of confusion or stress. Then if the student is confused or in need of help then the lesson could be modified and altered to be made more understandable for the student. The student could also be helped by a digital instructor that would trigger when the student is confused. Technology like this could give students better understanding of whatever is being taught knowing there are students that are too shy or scared to ask questions it could finally help them learn without having any fear of raising their hand and causing attention.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can really benefit students all around the world who would use it and prepare and give students more understanding in our future causing it to be brighter and more vivid ,therefore, the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable piece of technological advancment that could impact our future in a positive manner.
