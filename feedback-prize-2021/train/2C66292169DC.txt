Phones and Driving

Is it hard for you to put your phone down while driving? Hopefully it isn't because there are so many things that could be prevented.

Most of the time, people who text and drive think they can do both things at once.

Previous studies have shown,"In the United States,3328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone...". This shows that it's become very common which is absolutely wrong,your keeping you eyes off the road each time you glance over at your phone. As we know, anything could happen during that time you kept your eyes off for a few seconds.

Also a main reason why you shouldn't operate both things at once, is simply because it's illegal in some states. You don't want to be paying a fine much less do jail time. It's definitely not worth you being on your phone. And most definitely not worth your life or the life of others. For example,"A Minnesota woman sent and received 240 texts while driving one morning, before hitting and killing a motorcyclist on a highway exit ramp. she was acquitted of felony criminal vehicular homicide and instead convicted of careless driving,which carries a penalty of a month in jail and $50,000 in restitution". It's very common for officers to check how long ago you were on your phone before the accident to see if that was what lead to it.

These accidents could be easily avoided, considering the fact that companies have built bluetooth in cars so that if you get a call you can pick up through the car. Or as plain and simple as it sounds just don't pick up the phone at all.
