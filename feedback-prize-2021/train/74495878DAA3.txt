Dear Mrs. Principal:

School can be very boring at times. With all the policies and rules we have to follow it makes it feel like we are in jail. Letting us have our phones out during free time we would all love. I think it would help us feel more comfortable, make us feel more responsible, and also it would let us communicate with friends that we don't see often.

My first reason for letting us have our phones out during our free time is that it would make us feel more comfortable. School is not fun at times and the clothes we have to wear we hate, but letting us have our phones out would make us feel like we are at home. That would make us more comfortable letting us concentrate more.

My second reason is it would make us feel responsible. I know this sounds silly but giving us this privilege would make us feel responsible. I believe this would causes us to work harder for the teachers because we have a more respect for them.

My third and final reason is it would let us communicate with our friends. We hardly get to see some of our friends through out the day. The only time we get to talk to them is after school and sometimes not for long because the teachers run us off. Letting us talk to them would make the day less stressful and fun.

All in all letting us have free time with our cell phones would actually help us learn. I know you probably don't believe me but being more comfortable, less stressed, and having fun actually helps us learn and pay attention more.

Sincerely,
