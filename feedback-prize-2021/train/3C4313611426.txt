So you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy but you think it is a very stupid boring job well sorry to bring it to you but it is once in a lifetime experience. It is so amazing to see all of the different countries while your at it.

The job of a Seagoing Cowboy is very adventures. If you are a adventures guy this is perfect you get to see many great places in the world, and who doesn't want to see new places, it is a blast. You can see many amazing places like I did say for example the Panama Canals they were really cool. You get to experience many great things like going to Venice, Italy, "A city with streets of water." You get to visit many more great places like these but sometimes it does take some time to get there but that is just part of the fun.

This job is also very awesome because you can have a lot of fun while doing this job. There are a lot of fun things to do when you are a Seagoing Cowboy for example after you are done with the main job which would be delivering the stuff you can play many different games and puzzles onboard the ship. They are really really fun for example you get to play baseball, volleyball, and even have table-tennis tournaments you could all that in the place were you held the animals, I had a lot of fun and I still do I love this job.

Seagoing Cowboy is a really cool job to have you get to travel to so many new places and see a bunch of cool things and on this job everything is fun. It is really fun having this job and I do recommend takking this job it is really awesome.
