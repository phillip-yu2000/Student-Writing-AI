I would love for you to jopin his career in Sesagoing Cowboys . We aren't just some npeople who sail the seas right Charels ,"Yep". if you care about animals as much as I do you would join us today. These animals need someone like you . Thec greatest thing is you meet so many people .

If you do join I hope you beat my record for most missions completed 9. It's only nine becase it takes years to cross the ocean . On this ship you can be your self . And did Italk about the trips you take . The only thing you know about the trips you don't know the trip itself .

My favorite parts is the traveling and the games after the trip .

Like boxing baseball ,volley ball , and more . On the way you are always with friends and animals . So , now you get to keep the animals as pets .I now got one queston for you are you ready to join .
