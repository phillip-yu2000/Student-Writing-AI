i think that you should not play any sports or do any activities if you have a grade D average. the reason i think that is because not many students are not very smart to get a B average every time on their report cards. I also think that you should be a able to be in any activities or sports with a C grade average. the other reason I think that you should participate with a C grade average is because you or not failing. and the reason I said a D grade average is because that's when you're failing you're classes. and i think mostly students in this town are a C grade average and most of them are really good at sports. so if the coaches wants his team better his not going to have many good players because many students are a C grade average. so I think if students want to be in any sports or activities they need to have a C grade average for all of there classes. And I also think that it would be easier for the students to get a C grade average.
