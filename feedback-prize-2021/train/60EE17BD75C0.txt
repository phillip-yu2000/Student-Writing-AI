The development of driverless cars could potentially benefit the average persons' daily life. For example,texting while driving. To illustrate my point texting while driving has caused many deaths in the past. Driverless cars could drastically change that by allowing the driver text as it continues driving itself. The "The Traffic Jam Assistant" is good with going faster,breaking,and steering. Special sensors are used to alert the driver when certain situations come about. That is when the driver will have control. Driverless cars also has a better response and control than humans alone. According to the text it states how the Dubbed LIDAR uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. This input is important for the car to imitate a human's skill at the wheel. Driving would be very easy.

Driveless cars is a big step in the future. There will be many benefits if peoplewould consider using these fascinating vehicles. Not only it is a safety feature,but it saves time and possibly money. It can affect the society in many ways and possibly change the world today. That is why I am for the development of driverless cars.
