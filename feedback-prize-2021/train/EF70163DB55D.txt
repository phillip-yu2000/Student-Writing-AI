In the world today people are coming up with new ways to do things such as having driverless cars. This is good because we know we can do things with technology we never could years ago. This can be bad because this can tell us that technology is over ruling us, but thats not the case now.

Driverless car can be a bad idea because looking at technolog these days, it does alway work properly and that could lead to the cars. if some wrecks another car that would mean that it would be the cars fault but all the blame would be one the "driver". No one would know how it happened properly because there would be indication on how it happened.

Another reason why this would be a bad reason to have drverless cars was that the speed would be the same for everyone and some people may be in a hurry to get to places and the cars would take only the main roads to get to their destination. If the car wasn't used right it would mean that many people would be in danger to reckless people in the world.

The last problem with this kind of car would be when the person in the driver seat won't pay attention to the road and they get hurt for it. Many people in the world would be get hurt because they aren't doing anything and think that they would be perfectly safe and they won't.

In conclustion, the world would be a safer place if we didn't have driverless cars. This would lead to fewer injuries, problems, and misusage of the cars. If we just stay the same we can have less problems as well. So before we start thinking about having anything relative to these driverless car we should think again.
