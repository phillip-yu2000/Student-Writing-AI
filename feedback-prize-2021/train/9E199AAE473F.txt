My position on driverless cars is i think that this is a good idea.

I yhink this is a great idea, and could help a lot.

It could help a lot with mothers on the go with a lot of kids, the simple fact of a major improvments on cars for the future, and people that like to text and drive or put on make up while driving.

The driverless car concept could help a lot in the future.

It would help those mothers that need to turn around or reach back to give there child something while she is driving. It would help because she could just put it into driverless mode and do what she needed to do.

It would be a major help for those people that happen to text and drive, or put on make up while driving.

The driver could then put the car into driverless mode, and send that last text or finish their make up before work, and prevent them from crashing.

The overall concept of driverless cars is a big acomplishment and could bring us closer to bigger, and better things for cars in the future.

The concept of driverless cars is far from being a every day thing, like it says in paragraph 10.

Once driverless cars are finished, and everyone will use them it will be a whole new thing for driving on the road.
