dear Principal,

I think doing community service is not a good idea. When where in school we are learning and when where out of school where playing and i don't think any of want to clean stuff up when they just wasted six hours of their life in school. If we where going to do it during school time then i wondent mind doing it. Teaching little kids school work i would never do that in school or out of school because your repeating what u learned and that is boaring i rather do homework then do that. I also don't get why you would think we all need to do all of these things. cleaning up the community that's a choice who cares if my friends do it doesn't mean i have to be like them and help out to. I think that it reallt not important to help because we have people that are paid to do this and i don't think we should do it for free. So what my position is that i don't want to have to do community work because its a wast of time for everyone.
