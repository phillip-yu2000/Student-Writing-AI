I would be against the self driving cars. There are plenty of reasons. They could always breakdown and instead of being able to fix a flat or something, it could be worse like the circut blew on the GPS or something. The cars could get into more accidents than actual people could cause. The cars could misslead you to your destination. Those are just a few things that could go wrong.

The reason I am against this is because, it would cost so much to get the parts fixed. The parts that you need the; GPS, Sensors, Radar, ect. "Radar was a device ona hilltop that cost 200 million dollars (paragraph 6, line 7-8)". So no mater what the cars are not worth that much. It simply is going to cost more to fix one of these cars than it is to a regular car.

Another reason is that, what if we do get the cars. If we get the cars whole bunch of laws will be changed. If they change the laws on cars what would happen to the people who still drive themselves without anyone else driving them. "...if traffic laws change, then laws will be needed in order to cover liabillty in the case of an acciedent (paragraph 9, lines 9-11). So if they change laws then people would have to learn a whole bunch of different laws.

Another reason is, what if technology fails on the car. What would happen if you got into a wreck? What if it wasnt your fault, it was the car? " If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at falt--- the driver or the manufacturer? (paragraph 9, lines 11-12)". If the car breaks down and causes an accident it could hurt someone really bad if not kill them.

There are plenty of reasons why driverless cars shouldn't be permited on the streets. It could cost alot, hurt alot of people, and or cause people to have to learn alot more than what they need. So intend I am against having driverless cars.
