So they have sent un-maned devices to explore but dont last more than a few hours. But NASA is looking back at simplified devices that are made of silicon carbide that can last up to 3 weeks in the harsh conditions of Venus. Which means we are getting closer to undertanding this amazing plant. NASA whats to send a blimp-like vehicle to surface the plant and use the drone to explore and collect samples. So the author did a great job telliing us about the plan and it seems that despite the dangers it can be accomplished with hard work and preparing for the dangerous mission of exploring Venus.
