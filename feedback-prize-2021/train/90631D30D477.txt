Driverless cars should be continued. Driverless cars should be continued because we have developed so much new and imporves stuff compared to what we had in the 1900's. In the 1900's I'm sure people were scared for the development of cars thinking of malfunctions, but cars turned out to be a great help for time. I also believe that these smart cars could help us get a new, imporved road system.

Time is limited. Let's say if you have a Family gathering to get to and you live in Indiana, but your family lives in California. You don't want to show up and be unrested and not be able to spend time with your family. You want to get sleep. These smart cars are a grea way for that. It's an auto pilot for cars.

In the early 1900's the car was invented, thinking back they used horses. I'm sure people were terrified of the thought of the car. It has helped improve so many things for us. It makes our schedules more flexible, it gets us there fast and doesn't wear us out. If we could sleep while driving there would be so many more possibilities, we could leave at 9:00 expecting to arrive at 12:00, if we take a nap onm the way we could be there so quick and be energized for the rest of the day.

These reasons support my choice of continuing the development of smart cars.
