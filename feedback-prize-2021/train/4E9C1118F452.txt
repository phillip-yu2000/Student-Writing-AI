I don't believe that we should keep the Electoral College. Popular vote seems more like the way to vote for a president. Considering there are only 538 electors in the Electoral College, and only 270 votes are required it doesn't seem right that the people don't get to voice their opinion. Also considering the fact that the Electoral College may not be an efficient means of voting because of what happened in the 2000 election. Bradford Plumer states that it was the biggest election crisis in a century. We wouldn't want something like that to happen again.

If we use the popular vote instead there may be less chaos and the system would be more efficient. In the Elecoral College one person could say what is going to happen over thousands of people who may agree or disagree. Which to me doesn't seem like the right choice. The people of the United Sates should have the choice of who should be our next president. We as U.S. citizens have the freedom of speech and the right to vote. The Electoral College is simply unfair to voters,as well as irrational, as Bradford Plumer has stated. But Richard Posner does state that the Electoral College gives political balance to bigger states when it comes to the elections. Though it may benefit in some way it still has its flaws and shouldn't be used in something as big as an election for the president of the United States.        Â
