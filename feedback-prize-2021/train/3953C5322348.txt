The author feels that the pursuit to explore Venus is worthy despite the danger it comes with, he/she supported themselves by making a plan that could overcome the dangers of traveling to Venus.

NASA´s plan to send humans to Venus safely could very well work but also the way they would be thirty miles above the planett floating will not reallu give them a good look at what they are trying to study. ¨ More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas,or anything else, from a distance.¨, which was stated in the article. The planet Venus has such harsh conditons that humans could not withhold and survive, an example would be that ¨The temperatures average out at over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.¨ which was stated in the article. In my own opinion it would not be smart to even begin to plan a trip to Venus,especially when scientists and NASA know the risks and dangers, it would as if you are setting up their own death if even a spacecraft cannot survive the landing for more than a few hours.

My conclusion is that the author stated his point very well and had some good arguments as to why we could send humans to Venus, but I do not agree with the authors point of view on this topic.
