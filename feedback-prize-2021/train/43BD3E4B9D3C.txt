Many people tend to use their cellular device while driving. There are many advertisements made to show how using these devices affect lives. Unfortunately, people still chose to use their phones, endangering those around them. Regardless of how many people know the cause and affect, no one cares until it is them that is affected. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

It is said that smartphones is a substantial and cause us to make very poor decisions.

All of us feel capable of being able to do two things at once but, using a phone while driving shouldn't be on that list. Using a calling phone while driving can decrease the driver's awareness on the road. Using it also can increase the driver's risk of causing a crash.

Furthermore, using a cellular device while driving can increase death rates.

Another big reason drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because it is legal! Under some state laws, serious repeat offenders may even face jail time. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, punishments such as suspending a driver's license may be implemented by police. Even though there are jail penalties you can also get fined.

Using cellular devices while driving is dangerous. Even if the split-second you look away from the road doesn't cause the accident, someone else could cause it by doing the same thing. Avoid the dangers, keep the roads safe, and wait until you get home or aren't driving to send or read a message. If you can't help yourself when your phone rings with a text alert, either shut it off or pull into a parking lot to check your messages. Nothing is worth your life or someone else's.
