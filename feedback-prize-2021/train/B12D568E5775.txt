I agree and disagree, if i was the principal i would let the students decide what they do in school. students should'nt be forced to do school activities if they are not interrested. If students want to come to school and do nothing then let them do nothing and suffer the consaquences. If students want to come to school and do what they are supposed to thats good, let them work and get through school without any other school activities. School work keeps students busy they should'nt worry about having to do more than what they are use to.

I agree because i think kids should do something to keep them busy. If kids have troube listening and not following the rules they should do a school activity to make them think positive. Kids that play sports or help around the school might stay out of trouble and do better in school. If the kids that are doing well in school want to do a sport or any other school activity they should be able to too. They might want to focus on one thing more than others. Students should get to decide what they do in school.

I disagree because students might get too distracted with other school activities and not do their school work anymore. It could affect their grades and how they act. Students will get to think they can do anything they want to and start to get in trouble. The parents might start to complain to the school. I think principals should'nt let everybody do school activites, they should select certain ones. They should only allow students that listen and do well in school do school activies.

School might be harder for others and they might not be able to help how they act and what grades they. Students may try their hardeset and still not get good grades just because they dont understand and well as others to. That's why i agree and disagree that principals should make everybody do school activities.
