People ask for advice every day. Advice has a very big impact, especially for people who are young. People dont just only ask or talk to one person when seeking for advice, they ask multiple people. The more people that give you advice, the more successful you will become in life and if you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, multiple people can change your mind.

Getting advice from multiple people can help you in life. Every person has different beliefs and views to everything and it can be very helpful at times. Someones advice can stick with you throughout your entire life and help you when you are in a tough spot. There could also be some misleading advice. For example if someone gives a piece of advice that you truly believe has a negative outcome, do not use it.

If you are going to do something that has a negative outcome, someones advice can stop you from doing it. Some advice makes you rethink a situation and change the outcome. If you think a situation is bad and you ask someone advice, it can be very helpful. If you think someone is in a bad situation, you give them some advice too. If you give someone your advice they will be very thankful and might do the right thing.

In conclusion advice is beneficial. If someone gives you advice, you should cherish it. Advice can come from anyone, not just people you know. Advice goes a long way and it has a great impact on people. There is a also bad advice and you need to watch out for too.

Advice makes a person more successful and helps them not do negative actions towards themselves or others.
