Have you ever wondered what it would be like without cars? well i havent but maybe you have. This whole idea is about limiting car usage. Selling cars, diesel and life without cars are the three ideas i will be talking about.

To start off with selling cars, 70 percent of pepole sold their cars in order for them to move to the suburbs. Most people say that selling their car was the best thing for them because it made them less tense and stress. Walking would be better for the cities so there is less polution and fuels in the air that we breath.

Secondly diesels, Diesel has been blamed since France has a tax policy that favors it over gasoline. Diesel makes up over 67 percent of vehicles in france. It only makes up about 53.3 percent of vehicles in the Western part of Europe according to Reuters.

Last but not least life without cars, It is an improvement campaign, it bagan in bogota in the mid 1990's. Without cars bicyle paths have made it to 118 miles, that is the most of any Latin American city. Also parks and sport centers have bloomed without cars throughout the city. Another thing is rush hour has gotten so much better it has cut out most of the trafic dramatically.
