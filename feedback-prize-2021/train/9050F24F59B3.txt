The "Does the Electoral College Work?" document expains all the functions of the electoral college and how it works. Allthough some people might think the Electoral College is useful some people think it is outdated and perfer to do away with it.

The Electoral College is a process that has been used for hundereds of years and was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. Seeing as it was created when the Constitution was makes the process seem very old. A direct election would make a better election. Paragraph ten states that "Under the electoral college system, voters do not vote for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president". This makes the electoral college unfair to voters, making it as if their vote does not count.

Another key point is notÂ  even knowing who your electors are. Paragraph ten asks a series of questions like, "Who are the electors?", "Who picks the electors in the first place?", or "Can voters control whom their electors vote for?". Also stated in paragraph ten, voters sometimes could get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The American people would be much more justified if there was no electoral college and they knew who they were voting for.

On the contrary, the electoral college has some admirable features. one example is that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, states paragraph nineteen. Which paragraph nineteen also states is a desirable result due to the fact that a president with only regional appeal is unlikely to be successful.

Allthough the electoral college does have desirable traits and appealing affects, it is an oudated and old method of electing our president. Every single American able to vote should have a vote that counts and is clear as to whom that vote is going twords.
