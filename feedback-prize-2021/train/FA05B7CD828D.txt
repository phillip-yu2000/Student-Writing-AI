The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, it'll allow teachers to better understand their students.

If teachers could identify when a student begins to lose interest in a lesson, then the teacher can think of a better way to teach them. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." The FACS also allows teachers to identify which students are going through depression. Leading those students getting faster help, and less suisides. The FACS is able to tell mixed emotions and identify each one in a percent value. "She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."

I believe this evidence is able to express my claim that, the use of FACS to read emotional epressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The technology gives teachers chances to avoid multiple, unwanted situations.
