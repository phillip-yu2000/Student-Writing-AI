Dear Principle,

Should high school students have cell phones at school? I think teens in high school should be able to have phones out during free times and lunch periods. Their safety is important and there's no reason they should not have it.

Students should have their phone on them at all times except during class but during passing periods and lunch time. Some students abided by the rules and follow the rules some not, that's why there's so strict rules at school. Their phones must be turned off during class periods but on silent or vibrate at lunch or between class periods. The safety of others and themselves rely on cell phones.

There's no reason students can not have their phones out during lunch or between class periods.

Some high schools don't even let students have their cell phones out during lunch or between class periods. If you don't give the students a little freedom their just going to want to bend the rules every which way.

In conclusion i think high school students or even just seniors should be able to have their cell phones out during lunch or passing periods. Phones out during class period should be not allowed. That's why i think cell phones should be aloud for safety and theirs no other reason they should not be aloud.
