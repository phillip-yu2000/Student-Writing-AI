Technology is expanding at an alarming rate. One year the car is just becoming an idea and decades later they already have plans on making that same idea better. When the car was first made people were skeptic about how it would work and how people could afford them, now many people own cars and people are proffessionals on how they work. Over the course of the cars history many things have been added and many things have been changed, Adding new and additional features such as a driverless feature seems like a great idea once it is perfected. Tests need to be made so that the car can perform every task over and over again without a mistake. Basically I'm saying the driverless car feature has to be perfect in every way before these cars are put out on the market. Completely driverless cars would revolutionize the world in a great way due to the facts that someone could get a ride if they are in an emergency situation, unable to drive, or just need to multitask on the way to work! Being in a completely driverless car would make life easier for people to get from point a to point b or anywhere else.

Before driverless cars should become legal many different safety tests should be made. Making sure that the car is one hundred percent safe is the number one priority and should be taken seriously. If all future requirements for this car are made then these cars could be a start to something phenominal.
