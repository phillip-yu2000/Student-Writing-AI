Most of us know how far we have reach with modern technology, defitnetly far. Due to this is not that surprising that nowadays computers are able to recognize people's emotions through this new software. Where is technology taking us?

It all starts by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), a system that basically makes computers identify the movement of human muscles in the face that show different human emotions. This lets computers know if you are either sad or happy, uninterested or bored, etc. So now what? Computers are being able to comprehend our emotions, interact and even understand us? As crazy as it sounds, it can actually work in a good way.

How can a software on a computer actually benefit us, and indeed work in our way, especially if you are a student? Well, this makes computers able to understand student's feelings towards an assingment. It will indentify students emotions and help them benefit by trying to work with them. As Dr. Huang (1 of the innovators of this software) states on the passage on paragraph 6, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". This could help students by trying to make the work easier for them, making it more interesting, or making it easier by a change of words we'll understand better. "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effetive human instructor". Basically like a teacher, but the "teacher" is really the computer that helps you understand the content better by your facial expressions or emotions in regards to the work or assingment you are taking.

In this era where technology is such a big thing, we can expect a lot of things, even computers being able to comprehend our emotions and make something out of it. Whether it is telling us if the Mona Lisa was really happy or not, make us have more interest on an assingment or make a videogame better, all those things add a value to this software which can be a helpful thing in the future.
