Car usage around the world has skyrocketed pollution levels tenfold. In Paris, France they had to ban driving for 2 days to help clear out the fog in the city (Source 2). Some cities have even stopped using cars altogether, many of the townspeople believe that cars just cause more stress in peoples lives (Source 1).

In Colombia, the Day Without Cars is becoming more and more popular each year. It's a great way to lower stress and air pollution (Source 3)!

Since 2005, car usage in America has gone down every year, with less people getting a license and less cars being bought each year (Source 4). It begs the question: are cars growing away from our culture? Many people would rather use public transportation or car-pool with friends than drive to work or other activities. Public transportation traffic is woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (Paragraph 43).

So maybe you should ask yourself if driving really is the best way to go, because it only causes stress, pollution, and it's a danger to your safety every time you drive onto the road. Maybe it's just best to limit car usage and pull out the old bicicle or take the bus and meet new people.
