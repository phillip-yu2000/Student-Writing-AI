I beleive that we should change the Electoral College becuase even when one president wins the election from the people he can lose the election. For example one person running for president can get 154 more popular votes, but if the other person recieves 270 electoral votes or more then they would win foe example in the text it states "it is entirly possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote". Even though i think the electoral college is bad there are some good things about it, For example it states in the text "A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a disput over the popular vote". But despite that the Electoral college is an accident waiting to happen, and just because no one has fought or protested agaist the Electoral College over the years its been alive doesn't necessarally mean its not going to happen in the future. So to prevent the fighting and the unfair treatment all we have to do is get rid of the Electoral College.
