At first, when you hear driverless car, you think what in the world. That sounds so cool, I want one. Let me just tell you, they may sound cool, but how safe is it really?

Driverless cars seem cool and easy, but do they really sound safe? These cars have a lot of sensors, but what if one of them breaks? In my opinion, yeah sure it would be nice, but I wouldn't trust them. Like it said in paragragh 9, drivers would get tired of waiting for the car to signal them to drive. Just because there are entertainment systems doen't mean it will keep drivers focused. There would still be the pain of always waiting around for the car to signal you to take control.

This car would also raise many questions if you got into wreck. Whos fault is it you were in a wreck? It could be the manufacturer of the car because something broke or didn't signal right. It could also be your fault for now paying attention. Not to mention, if these cars were allowed, lots of things would change. Traffic laws would change in order to deal with all the expenses and damage done in an accident. Who is going to pay for all of it?

Finally, I just don't see these cars being a very good idea. They are driverless cars yet you have to be ready to drive when it needs you to. Many things could go wrong. Are you willing to take the risk?
