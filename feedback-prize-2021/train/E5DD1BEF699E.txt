Dear TEACHER_NAME:

I'm a student here at SCHOOL_NAME and I'm behind you one-hundred percent; I believe students should be required to do community service too. It will help the community, it could help with their character, it could be added as a credit for high school, it looks good on a resume', and they could possibly have fun. I would do community service, but it would be a lot more fun if my friends were with me. Maybe that's what needs to be advertised about community service; 'you will help the community and you'll be with the people you have fun with.' I could get some of my friends together and we could plant a tree, or pick up trash around campus, or on the streets, or even on the beach. We'll get it done and we'll have fun doing it. So yes, I believe students should give back to the community and help out for once. Maybe some of the students will like helping society and want to do it again, or even as a hobby. And I'm sure there will be some students that think it's a total waste of time, but at least they tried it and helped out a little. It's a good chance to take if some of the students will actually like helping and they'll do it again and again and they even get their friends to come help next time. I hope the students and staff members believe the same thing we do.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
