A vacation to Venus, scientist are studying to prove that there could not be any human life on Venus. Studying Venus is not a worthy pursuit depite the dangers because it is to hot,no form of light , and the atmosphere is not safe for and human or animal life. Venus is way to hot for any animals or human life on this unqie planet. In the next it states that "On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit." This proves that this is way to hot for human and animal life on this planet. The text also states that "Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun." This also proves that even though that Venus is not so close to the sun as Mercury is the planet Venus is still hotter than anything in the solar system. On this plant Venus there is not form of at all. In the text it states that " Most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmoshere, rendering standard forms of photography and videographic in effective." This proves that because of the atmoshere there cannot be any light because of how strong the atmoshere is. Venus dose not have a safe atmoshere for humans nor animals.
