Dear Principal

The Police i think is correct is Policy 1. I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch.

I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class,

but if is in lunch or free time I don't see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school.

If we put policy number

2 at school it wouldn't make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time. So I think that school are a problem while using it in class but I think that is not bad to use it during lunch time or free time.
