The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions, is pointless. I say this because a persons emotions could switch very quickly. Also, this technology has been tested on paintings, paintings dont have emotions. This means that the technology is wrong.

If a website or app is detecting emotions from picture what makes you think it could detect emotions from a real peson. This "new" technology doesn't make any scense. Why would someone possibly let a machine tell them how there feeling. Theres no way possible that a painting has emotions, it may look sad or happy but it has no true emotions.

There are many different apps that do different things. Theres even a app that detects lies. These apps are fake. No cellphone app could really tell you if your lying or not. This technology should be tested out on many humans. Just to be sure.

Different people have different opinions, but only scientist will actually know the truth. Even scientist can be proven wrong so its more of a the world may never know type of situation. Until actual proof of this technology is being shown i personally will not believe it.
