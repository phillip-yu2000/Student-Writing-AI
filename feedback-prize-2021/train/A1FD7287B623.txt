Dear Principal,

I've been thinking about your policies towards the phone use during school hours. I thought about it and the second choice seems the best one to me. Like this the students will be more concentrated on their tasks, and will stop texting during class periods. On other words students will wait until lunch or like you said free time to use theirs phone This way you can evade confiscating students phone all the time. Also teachers would have more time to teach the class, and she/he wouldn't have to stop the class to take the phone away from the disobeying student. This policy would also help the school because students would pay more attention to what their learning and would get better grades. It can come in handy because the school and the principal would get a good reputation towards how they control the school and the students. Most students would like you more and probably look up to you in a possible future as a great idol. This is the way I think about your policy toward the phone use in school hours, judge me if am wrong.

P.S: CHOOSE THE FIRST POLICY AND YOU WON'T REGRETT IT , TRUST ME !!

Sincerely,
