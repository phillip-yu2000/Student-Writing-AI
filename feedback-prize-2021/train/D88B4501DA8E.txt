I think we should not let the students play sports unless they have a grade point average as an A or an B because the students should do all assignments given and they should study at home for the test. we shouldn't let them play sport until they pull there grades up to at least a B average in school . They should have no missing tasks to play sport. the students should care about there school work more than they do sports . they shouldn't have behavior issues either. They should have good grades to play all sports not just for one or two sports. The students shouldn't play sports If they have any kind of C its doesn't matter about high or low C .We should have nothing lower than a B to play sports of any kind. The students should have a study hall twice a week to pull there grades up if they want to play sports . The students shouldn't play sports with a C because they would thing they could play around and as long as there passing there not worry about anything else but playing sports so take away sports until they pull up there grades in school. Give them notes on tests so that they can study for the test. taking away sports because of bad grades is a good idea . When there grades are at least an B or higher then they should play sports but education comes before sports.
