In America we have lots of cars, lots of roads, leading anywhere you want to go. In Europe they have car free cities where things may run a lot smoother;quicker. Limiting car usage could raise property prices due to lack of highway noise and can protentially save the world from population extinction due to smoke from the tail pipe.

On houses near the highway , of my knowledge, the price is usually lower because you have to suffer the aggonizing pain of the cars honking an zooming past. In the passage "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars""When I had a car I was always so tense. I'm much happier this way," said  Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked the streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out  occasional distant motor." Most American families want to live in quiet and peaceful homes. If cars were to be limited there would be less noise and then there will be a higher value for the houses next to the roadways.

Smoking an second hand smoking is one of the leading causes of death. All cars have a tailpipe and all cars let out ridiculous amounts of gaseous smoke during the average cars lifetime. In an article I read about Paris, titled "Paris bans driving due to smog", the goverment was over-whelmed by the amounts of smog in their city. They proposed a law to restrict drivers from driving on certain days based on their drivers license plate numbers. Thereby reducing the smog in the city. Then when the smog was cleared ramoved the restriction. Less smoke means more fresh air, more fresh air means more healthy and active people running around the world creating more jobs for a better future.

All throughout the world goverment, kings and parliaments are trying to dispel smoking while  cars are one of them, without them there will be higher property values and less greenhouse gases in the air. I believe with less cars in the world we will live a easier life with less coughing and wheezing.
