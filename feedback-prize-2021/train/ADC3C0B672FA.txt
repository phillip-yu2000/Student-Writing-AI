I think that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in their classroom is valuable. It is valuable becuase it can show when a student is losing interest or becoming bored or even if they are confused. it would be able to show the pace the student is learning and how comfortable they are with it.

Teachers should be able to use the Facial Action Coding System becuase it can help the students stay more focused instead of just sitting there and letting the information go into one ear and out the other. It can help the teachers be able to keep students on task.

Another reason why this technology might be a good idea for teachers in their classrooms is it can help showing when a student might not get the material or they might be confused and not understand what they are working on. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, it can help the student get more help from teachers and their grades might even go up because it is showing the teachers how they are truly feeling in that class.

The last reason why I agree with having the Facial Action Coding System is valuable is because it can show when the students are ready ti move onto the next thing because they are comfortable enough with the material. It shows the students are ready for the next thing. It could also help tell if the class is too easy and the student might need an advanced class or the things they are learning are too challenging for them.

This Facial Action Coding System is valuable in many ways. It may not be the most important thing to have in the classroom but it will help with putting the students with what they are ready and comfortable enough with to learn.
