To the principal of this school,

I feel that policy 2, which states that students are allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as the phones are turned off during class time should we chosen.

My reasoning behind this is that there is no harm if the students have their cell phones out as long as it isn't in class. When the students are in class they are learning, but when they are outside of class, they aren't and they don't have work they need to focus on and complete.

I feel that if students have phones out during lunch and breaks, nothing would change. The only difference you would see is the student having their phones in the hall ways and outside. The students would still be doing their work in class the way they always do because phones are still not allowed in class.

Most students today have phones and feel that they shouldn't be banned at school, I personally feel that they should only be banned during class. Here at school we are told to keep our phones in our locker but most of us don't, including me. I don't go on my phone during class but when I'm not in class, I know that I would like to be on my phone since there is nothing to do.

This is only my opinion but I feel that many others would also agree with me. Please take the writing above into consideration.

Thank you,

Student
