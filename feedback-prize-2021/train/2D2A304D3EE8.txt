Driverless cars? Let's talk about that. In year 2013, BMW announced the development of "Traffic Jam Assistant." This cars speed goes up to 25 mph, meanwhile in cars that we can drive go over 100 mph. This car can also notify the driver when the car needs to be taken control of. Vribrations are one of the notifications the car will give to you if there seems to be a problem with backing up into something. The Google car can announce itself when the car should be taken over. Flashing lights on the windshied is another way for notifying the driver. All of these simple, small notification symptoms are meaningless if you fall asleep while sitting in the car seat while your car is driving for you, This will be an all new crashing scale for the records.

Think of all of the possible ways that this manufacture driving car can cause so much harm. The casualties would be off the charts. Television shows have displayed a driverless car many times in the past, and people have yet to seem to realize that those are movies, not reality. Movies are works of art created by ones mind of imagination, If it's in a moive or in a show, then there should be a reason why it isn't real already. Not to mention the price. Having a driverless car would cost a lot of money. Why, you ask? They're new, rare, and there's a lot of sensors built into the car and a GPS reciever.

Driverless cars are dangerous because there's still a lot of mindless drivers out there in the world and driverless cars can simply comprehend the speed and damage another person can do within seconds. These types of cars and stop if there's something in the way behind the car. But what can the cars do when there's a speeding car coming right towards you? It can't drive and spin off somewhere. Stopping wouldn't do a thing, especially if you're at a stop light. These types of cars need a whole lot of more thinking and technical fixes to be put into this idea before they can become anything worth wanting.
