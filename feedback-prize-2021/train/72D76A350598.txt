If you enjoy taking care of animals and helping needy people, you would love to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. This job would be an opportunity of a life time. You would be able to make many trips to different countries. You can help take care of all the farm animals on the boat.

Also,you would help needy people that are in need food or water during your trip.

Firstly,you would have to learn how to take care of the animals on the boat. Seagoing Cowboys take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. The animals would have to be fed and watered three times a day. You would also have to pull bales of hay and bags of oats from the lower holds of the ship. Personally, I love taking care of all the animals on the ship because they are very nice and friendly.

Next, another great thing about being a Seagoing Cowboy is you can travel to many different parts of countries. For example, I had made nine trips to distinct countries. While you are in these places, you`ll get to have free time and explore the villages better. One of my favorite places that I got a chance to go to was in Crete where I toured an excavated castle on my way to China. You might also get to got to exciting places like this if you apply for the job.

Lastly, during your free time on the trip, you might want to stop by and help the people that are on the streets in need of food or water. If you have any extra food on the ship, you can donate it to the hungry. Doing this made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.
