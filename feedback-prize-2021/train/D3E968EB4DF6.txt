IF i really had a saying to this, i would ask my self the same thing "does the electoral college work"? For now all i could say that the only good thing electoral college is good for is for ,messing things all up. the college electoral compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Too me what's even wrong is that according to a gallup poll in 2000,taken shorly after AlGORE,thanks to the quirks of the electoral college,won the popular vote but lost the presidency,over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. The electoral college is really bad we dont need it no more it's time to take it down, they been lieing to us. Under the electoral college system,voters vots not for the president ,but for a slte of electors,who in turn elect the president. the fact that they even did that how can they get a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy. Faithless electors have occasionally refused to a vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. thats why i think its time for the electoral college to go and never come back because they dont care what we (the poeple) have to say then we dont need to hear what they have to say.Â
