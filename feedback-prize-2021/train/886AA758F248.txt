Dear Mr. Principal,

You are in the middle of a very important decision, the decision to make community service required or not. I believe you should make community service required. There are many students who enjoy doing community service but there are those who do not want to help out. We should inspire them to help.

If you mandate community service, people will do it but some of them will do it with disgust. Those students will make sure that you know they don't want to do it. Athletic types may not have the time help out in the community. I know that sounds bad, but a dedicated basketball player would most likely not turn down a game for cleaning in the community.

That's why we need to require it and give them opportunities to help out.

On the other hand, if you were to oblige community service we would have a cleaner community. We also would have a more united community. It would be united because students would work together so it would be more fun. Also you could only require us to do community service 24 hours a school year. Another option is to require it in monthly terms. You could require 2 hours of community service a month and if you went with that option, you should give a list of ideas.

All in all, I would like to see our school do more for the community. I would support your decision to require our student body to do community service. Also you could put together a community clean-up club for those who want to get the service done with their friends. I would recommend a minimum of 2hours a month. I believe that is enough time to walk several dogs in our community shelter. Also 2 hours is enough to read stories to elementary students. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you make a decision that will improve our school, community, and nation for the better.

Thank you,
