Dear Principal,

I think that making students have a "B" average to participate in sports is really uncalled for. I think that most students who do more good in sports than school, will only obtain a "C" average. Having a "B" average would be kind of hard obtain if you play sports and go to school. I think that having such a high standard for a person would greatly affect them. I don't think everyone that plays sports has the ability to keep up with their grades. I know that their grades must be good but I think that this standard is just way too high. Having high standards is good for people, but it takes too much work. I know for a fact that playing sports and keeping A' s and B' s is very stressful for a student. I always ask my friend, who plays basketball, if keeping up her grades is stressful. My friend told me that she is up until 2 a. m. in the morning doing her homework sometimes to keep her grades up. She does that just to maintain a "C" average.

It's hard to imagine that people stay up that late doing homework but it is very true. When I used to do dance, I didn't finish my homework until 12 a. m., because I was trying to keep an "A" in my English class. These days, people have their lives to live and other stuff to do. I don't think anyone in this world would want to spend their nights doing homework the whole time because of the sport they play. Leaving the standard to a "C" average is the best thing for people who play sports.
