To Principal:

I think you should allow students to bring their cell phones incase if they have to make a call during their lunch or free periods. I agree as long if the students don't have the cell phones on during class time or else they should be confiscated. If the cell phone aren't allow in school and if the student/students has an emergency they can immediately call a relative or friend to come pick them up from the school, but you have to talk to the relative or friend just to be sure the student isn't cutting from class time. Some high school allow the first Policy between periods and during their lunch periods. So my conclusion is I really support cell phones allow in school during their free periods or lunch periods as long it off during class and if it is on then you shall confiscate it until a parent comes to take it from school.
