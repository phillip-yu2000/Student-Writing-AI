Yes, many people do think that the "Face on Mars" was a monument created by aliens, possibly creating a sign of some sort. However, this is not true. What you think is the "face" is actually a natural landform. This natural landform may appear to look like a face, but why?

The landform looks like a face becuase of the shadows that hit the landform in certain areas. "... this... had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (2)." It makes it look somewhat like a face. "...a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth (3)." Another reason why the landform looks like a face is becuase our eyes, that play tricks on us, may make it seem real that it is a face. Such as illusion that make it appear that the landform looks like a face that is staring up at the camera on Mars. Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact.

"...Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origional... photos... when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no monument at all (7)." "What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West... That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12)." So the landforms that you are seeing are actually common along the American West. They don't just pop up out of nowhere. They have been seen before. It's not like it is a first thing that scientists are just discovering.

This evidence proves that there is no alien monument on Mars, it may appear to look like it. But scientists have proved that it is only a natural landform, created naturally, on Mars. Not an alien monument that was created as a sign by aliens on Mars.
