Do you have car? could live with out your car? there a new trend going on. In a few citise around the world are not using cars. some people may ask,what are the perk of not using car. One of these perk is it help pervent smog. The other is that we emit less greenhouse gas emission.

In the U.S we dont' get smog for car. we tend even  to hear about smog at all. But paris that another story. They banned the uses of personal automobiles just so they could reduce the amount of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter. Compare to brussel which is 114 (PM) and london which is 79.7 (PM).The best city to compare paris smog to is beijing because just like them the smog is very visble. Once your able to see smog by just looking outside that not a good sign. It then becomes unheathy just to breath the air around you. Would want to live in a city where all you see is smog?

GreenHouse gass emission is a very known topic today. Car produce this gass which add to globel warming. Theren other thing that cause this like buring tree,fossil fueland other thing. But car are responsible for 50 percent of greenhouse as in U.S.,because car are the main way of transportation. If we limited our car uses like in Vauman how they only one road to get to a tran to ther downtown. If we could do that in america we could cut down our greenhouse emission by half.

What are the point in have a car when then ther con out weight ther pro. All they really give us is smog and more greenhouse gass emission then we already have. We could just walk to place we need to go even take a bus or taxi. So what reason do we have to have car? If we don' t use car we help the city and world we live in.
