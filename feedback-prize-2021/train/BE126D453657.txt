Making decisions can be hard sometimes but it can become quite easier when you go to others for help. I've came up with a couple of reasons and examples to why it is better to ask more than one person for help when you con to a bump int he road.

Everyone has thought of different strategies to do an activity so why not go see things from others perspective. Here's an example of what this might look like. Lets say it almost 1 in the morning and your out with your friends and you were supposed to be home by 12am. You guys were just jamming to music while driving to go get some food. Your phone starts ringing and you realize that it was your mom. You panic so u just let it ring. She called a couple more times after so you turn to your friends and ask them what you should say. Everyone said to not worry about it and just relax besides one person. He told you that you need to answer here and at least tell her that you are safe and where your going. He has been in the same situation before and chose to do the the wrong choice and regretted it later when the cops were searching for him.

Asking more than 1 person can also give you more verities to chose from and give you thought that you never would have. Imagine that you are planning a surprise party for one of you family members that are moving from a different country. You don't know what they are interested in so you go to family members that have met them before and ask questions like, What's their favorite type of food? What activities do they think are fun? Etc. By the time the move you will have plenty of options for the food, party theme, games, and music!

At the end of the day, asking for help from multiple people isn't a problem because you never know what kind advice you might get in return. Just know that it all comes down to you to decide who you would rather listen to. And who can trust.
