Dear, whoever

I think policy 1: Allowing students to bring phones to school and allowing them to use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time is a great policy. However, not every child is a law abiding citizen of this beautiful country we call the United States of America. You see, we have the same exact policy at my school. when I am in class I can look all around the my classroom and see almost 20% out of 20 students texting or silently whispering in there phones. I will admit it myself I am apart of that 20%

using there phones and not paying attention in class.

Right now if I was not told to turn off my cell phone before writing this letter and taking this random NAEP examine I would be texting. There for I will have to agree with policy 1, because even thought there are many reasons students should not have cell phones in school there are many more and better reasons why they should. Lets say a student misses there bus or have an activity to do after school. The doors to the school are locked and he can't get inside and he or she lives more than 4 miles away. That is when a cell phone could come in handy.

So I am going to have to go for policy
