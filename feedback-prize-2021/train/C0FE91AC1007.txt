You should join the Seagoing Cowboy. There is many reason why we should join the

Seagoing Cowboy. We may never have free time to go to other Places,but is fun. I'm going to tell you my reason. My opinion is that is kind of fun,but you may never visit your Family.

The first reason is You get to visit Places you never visit before. in the text,it said that Luke visited Places that He never visit before. don't you think that is awesome.

You can take Picture of were you been and show it to your Family. You can have fun while you are working.

The second reason is that You have freetime. on Paragraph 8-9 it Said that Luke and his Friends got to play Games. Who likes to play Games,all of us right! That shows that We don't just work,but We have fun. When We are tire all We want to do is rest and have fun. This is a fine Job.

and The last reason is that We get to see Horses And Bulls. if you are a Cowboy ,People see you as a Brave Person. You get to touch and feel a Bull. You get to feel the action you never felt before. being close to a Bull is something Incredible. It makes You look brave. People start to think good of you. We all like that people think good of us. being a Cowboy makes you a Brave Person.

so what Am I trying to say is that being a Cowboy is Awesome. You get to go to Places you never been Before,You have freetime,and you are a Brave Person That Gets to touch and feel a Bull. You Have all that in Seegoing Cowboy. try being a Cowboy,You will know how fun it is. it is not bad to try. try it.
