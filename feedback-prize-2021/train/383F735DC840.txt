Many people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, its a once in a lifetime experience and you wouldn't want to miss it! If you know someone that works in the Seagoing Cowboys, You can always ask them about it and you could sign up today!

You could go to unique and cool places, You could also meet amazing and cool people while visiting these places. You may not want to leave your home and family but it will be worth it in the end. I went to Europe, China, and Greece. Greece was my favorite. Once you visit these places you can meet unbelievable people that might end up joining the Seagoing Cowboys with you!

This is a once in a lifetime experience to go around and help people and animals out at sea, you can easily save many lives. You could become well known for saving living creatures. Every so often you get to go out on a boat and rescue people and living things, You dont get to do that often at home. I thought it was a great opportunity to save these things.

Another good thing about joining is that you can have lots of fun with your friends or work buddies. This experience could change your life, like it did mine. "The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy" We all had time to have fun on the boat, we played baseball, volleyball, and many more games. We also played board and card games.
