Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe you should reconsider your cell phone policy, to cell phone policy number one. I believe you should choose cell phone policy number one, for numerous reasons. One reason is, kids wouldn't try as hard sneaking there phones out in class, and being worried about getting caught rather then paying attention to the actual lesson, that is being taught. Second reason, students would also want to come to school more often too, because they know they'll still be able to use there cell phones on school ground. Which at this age many students want to do or even tend to do, and suffer the punishment or not get caught at all. My last reason, students would be able to get out what they need to say to a fellow student before class, other then students passing notes, talking across the class room, or making excuses to leave the classroom to see another student. TEACHER_NAME, cell phone policy number one will benefit; the student, which it can make easier to stay out of trouble. The teachers, where they will not have to stop lessons to take up a phone. This will also benefit you as well, by you not having to take time out of your day to address the situation that should not come up. With that, TEACHER_NAME

choose policy number one.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
