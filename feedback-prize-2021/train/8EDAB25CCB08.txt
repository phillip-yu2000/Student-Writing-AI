Dear, TEACHER_NAME

Community service should be a revered thing.

Many people are forced to do it if they are facing probation or are already on it.

I don't believe that is the correct thing to do.

Without these people many community service projects would be neglected, but it is still slightly haunting to think about the fact that humans(Americans especially) do not care enough to take care of the other inhabitants of Earth, and sometimes even the Earth itself!

I don't believe that community service should be a requirement but instead a choice.

I consider the option of the student being able to receive extra credit in school for it a very good idea.

If the students of this school need to participate in community service so be it, but you should give them the choice of saying no while making the choice of saying yes so good that it should be nigh impossible to refuse.

If community service is imposed on students there is a chance they will purposely NOT do it.

The students age heavily depend on this.

People at this age are natural rebels, they don't want to do what'd asked of them, and it doesn't matter if its for their good or not.

If you make it sound like there idea or it's not REALLY required they will probably be more accepting to the fact that they are going to have to do it one way or another.

Either way it goes I think that community service is a great idea with great possibilities and that students SHOULD be involved in it.

Just my thoughts,
