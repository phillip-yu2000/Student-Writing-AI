Have you heard about the face on Mars? There was indeed something that looked like an enmormous head that was nearly two miles from end to end that seemed to be staring back at the cameras from the Red Planet. This hug face is known as Cydonia.

This shadowy face was discovered in 1976 when a NASA spacecraft was circling around the Red Planet. The photos that were taken of the shadows looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The text states, "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh." Some scientists started to believe that the Face was an alien artifact. The text states, "Although dew scientists believe the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions end."

Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and the team took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The text states, "Thousands of anxious web surfers wete waiting when the image first appears on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." Even though people were given that information that the shadowy figure was indeed not an alien monument, some people were still not satisfied. So mission controllers decided to look again. The text states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivanlent of a buttle or mesa-landofrms common aroung the American West." It was decided that the shadowy figure, was just a natural landform.

The shadowy figure known as Cydonia that was spotted on the planet Mars, was once thought as a alien artifact. Many studies from scientists have shown and proved that the enormous head was just a natural landform.
