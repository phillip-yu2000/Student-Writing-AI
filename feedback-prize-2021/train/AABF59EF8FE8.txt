Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Regarding the cell phones no cell phones on campus dilemma i would like to say a few things about passing policy number one. I believe allowing students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free times is a good idea. Allowing students to do this is a great idea for two main reasons.

The reasons I believe are most important include, first if a student forgets an assignment at home or may need a parent or family member to pick something up for them it is easy to contact them. The second reason is in case of an emergency, for example if a student witnesses something inappropriate or harmful they can contact authorities and get the help that they need.

I believe that if a parent has provided their child or children with a cell phone it should be accessible at all times. If you don't allow them to even bring their cell phones to school i believe is not the right choice. For example if a student walks home from school and doesn't have a way to contact someone incase of an emergency , that would be the schools fault. It would be a lot safer if students were aloud to use their cell phones, but only at designated times.

With this information that i as a student have provided I hope that You can take into consideration that cell phones on campus can be a good choice to make for your students
