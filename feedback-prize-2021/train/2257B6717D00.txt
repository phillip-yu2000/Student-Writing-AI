The Office of the Federal Register and Richard A. Ponser have introduced multiple communities to a process adressed as The Electoral College. This process most people find very convinient and efficient, is one way to vote for the President. The Electoral College allows societies to obtain a more educated vote towards a possible future President. The people vote for an elector instead of directly towards the presidential candidate. Having citizens whom have received a political education vote for the society's convenience, is definetly more efficient than having busy adults worry about the presidential candidates.

Students, as we know, study and work hard for a career they will accomplish in the future. These electorals have received the needed political and even physcological education to benefit a society with an educated vote. When citizens in a community vote for these electorals to have them vote the to-come President, it is an assured weight of stress taken off their shoulders. Source 3 says, "The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people." However, notice how it says the "electors elect the president" yet the people elect the electors. So yes, it is not fully democratic yet still has somewhat qualities of a democracy process. The Elecoral College is part democratic with more educated votes to benefit our society because in the end, the people who know more about the country's convinience are the electors.

Be that as it may, having electors vote and elect for the people is very much convinient considering their supirior knowledge within politics and our country's best choice. This argument is common sense. An average human would rather have a science teacher take their biology test than having a math teacher take it where her/his field of knowldge lands nowhere near science.
