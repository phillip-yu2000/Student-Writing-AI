Imagine you are stuck on a problem and you can't figure out what to do? So you need some advice, would you ask one person or multiple people for advice? When it comes to advice I ask multiple people for opinions when i'm stuck on a problem. Why? you might say. Well because I might not totally agree with one of the opinions so having more than one choice is good to think about. Advice people can give sometimes isn't the greatest or just it doesn't get to you so, you can move on to ask more people for opinions.

Friends are always good to talk to about problems you might have or advice you might need. Asking one person is good but, what if you don't like the sound of it. You are only going to think of that advice only. Seeking for multiple opinions would be a good idea because people could give you many more opinions to choose from. Also taking multiple peoples opinions can make you think which one is the best choice for you and why it's a good or bad advice.

Talking to you parents, friends, or councilors in your school is a great way to talk about your problems. They can always try to giveÂ you advice when you need it. Seeking for more opinions is always great for you to think about. Many people have different opinions and reasons to support their answers. Make sure to talk to someone when you need some advice for your problems. It can also make your life easier because choices matter. You can also listen to yourself as well.
