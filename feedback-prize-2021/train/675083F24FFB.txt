"Hello my name is Luke and I am going to give you reasons to join UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). I hope my claims inspire you to join the Seagoing Cowboys."

"My first reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to see places and things you never thought you would get to see." This claim can be found in paragraph five of "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" when it mentions the places and things Luke saw such as Acropolis in Greece and an excavated castle in Crete.

"Another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is that you get to help people in other countries that were affected by World War II. Some countries were left in ruins and need help to recover food and supplies." This claim can be found in paragraph two of "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."

"I have also had lots of fun with the other coyboys. We played games such as baseball and volleyball. We have also had fencing and boxing tournaments." This claim is found in paragraph eight of "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"

"I hope my claims have encouraged someone that reads this to join me and the rest of the Seagoing Cowboys. If not, than I hope you learned something about what I do and why I do what I do."
