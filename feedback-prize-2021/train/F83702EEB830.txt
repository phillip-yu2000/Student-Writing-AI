I agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health, yearbook writing is good for our spelling, and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people.

Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster.

Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn.

Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them. Helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper.

In conclusion I think that everyone has to do something is school it doesnt matter what but we have to. School is not just for learning and being bored in class, school is for you to be happy and confortle with everything, we can make school fun.
