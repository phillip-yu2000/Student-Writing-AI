Dear principle,

I believe that community service should be required for many reasons. One reason is it is helping our world become a better one. For example, picking up liter on the side of roads or in parks this is helping our world from global warning and making it cleaner for were we live. Also community service with helping people inst that difficult for example like helping someone get their groceries out of their car or helping an old lady walk across the street that's doing community service but its also being a good citizen and something people should do on a daily basis. I think community service would be a great thing for students in our school become better people and think different on some things. I believe that community service isn't taking too much time away from other things because it is still something important that you should be doing and if some people think that then maybe only do community service for a half hour each day or when you have more times on your hands do it for and hour but other then that it shouldn't be taking away from anything too important because you are helping people that is also one your priorities or should be. Community service should also make you feel good about yourself because you are helping others, so i don't see why anyone would have a problem with doing this. I think that community would be a great thing that should be required also to make sure people are actually doing the community work you should have their parent or guardian sign a paper or form saying that they did it or what they did for community service.
