Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. There is an interesting debate around this topic. Some people believe that the teacher should be the one to design these summer projects. other people believe that the students should design their own summer project. Teachers should be the ones to design these summer projects because they are the ones who know what is going to help the students get prepared for the next school year.

Teachers are much more responsible than their students which makes them better candidates for designing summer projects. Teachers are more mature than their students. Teachers know what the students are going to need for the future. Teachers would know what would be the best thing to do for their students. Teachers overall are best choice when debating weather or not they should be the ones to design summer projects.

Some people may still argue that students should be the ones to create their own summer projects because of reasons like, "It's their summer project, let them do what they want", or, "They should get to choose how they want to learn over the summer". While their may be some ground behind these claims, giving free choice to students like this is like giving a car to a child. They don't know what they are doing and it's just going to hurt them. These students could also rig the system in their favor and make it so easy that they don't need to learn anything, therefor, making the point of the summer project entirely pointless.

Ultimately the greatest and smartest choice to make in this situation would be to just let the professionals do their job so that the student get what they need. Students just need to do what they are given so that they may get the best outcome out of all of this.
