Dear senator,

I think for electing the president of the united states we should use popular vote because, sometimes certain presidents got more popular votes but the electoral college voting gave them president with the least popular votes with the election and they became president.

In the election between Gore and Bush, Gore had more popular votes than Bush but Bush still became president because of the electoral college voting system it needs to be changed. States with smaller electoral college voters don't have as much say in who's gonna become president,most of the states don't have more than 10 electoral college voters for them but, in the bigger states like califorina,texas,and florida have the most electoral college voters so they bascilly control who's gonna become president.

This is why I think the electoral college voting system should be removed because of its bad way of helping the united states in picking a president and sometimes it can help a bad person become president and ruin this country since it's mostly polticans who are the electoral college voters and they could just pick the person they want to be president and that person could be a horrible president.
