This technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because what if you wan't to joke around with a friend you don't know if they're sad. If they're sad then you can make them laugh. It would be great if classrooms had this technology because in paragraph 6 sentence 5 it says "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", it could show the teachers how to help the students learn the subject without making them bored or confused. In paragraph 6 sentence 6 it says "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor", what it's trying to say is that it could make the lesson more interesting than what a human normally would do.

My first reason to why classrooms should have the technology to read students emotions is because the technology can tell you how the student is feeling. The technology has six basic emotions and they are happiness, surprise anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. In paragraph 4 sentence 3 it says "The software can even identify mixed emotions."

My second reason is that the technology even told us the emotions of Mona Lisa. You're probably asking "how if Mona Lisa is just a painting?" well that's what I said. In paragraph 4 sentence 3 it says "using video imagery, the emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa". In paragraph 8 sentence 3 it says "to an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.
