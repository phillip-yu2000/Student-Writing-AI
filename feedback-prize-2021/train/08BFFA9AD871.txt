Dear Principal,

I believe no cell phones is the way to go. I believe this because students who use cell phones in school will be off task and no do there work.

One reason why i think this is because the students need to get a education and n not worry about that text they just received.

Another reason i have that might convince you to listen to this is because if you follow up with this rule students in the school will stop worrying about phones and more about school.

Witch means better grades and behavior and also better testing scores.

Maybe even less drama because as you see there are many conflicts that come from texting and social net works because someone said something over a text message.

So by not allowing this you could possibly prevent fights, and other harmful situations from happening.

Students also have all before school and after school even weekends to text so it shouldn't be happening in school.

If you were to let the students have their cell phones out and let them text, they wouldn't pay attention in class, not no what there doing, and get bad grades on important test and even homework.

they also might not listen to the teacher when he or she is talking witch might aggravate them and become mad at the student.

To finalize this statement i have to share with you i would like to say if you consider this idea this could really change how the school runs and make things better then they were.

So thank you for reading this and hopefully you consider this idea for a better and brighter future.

Sincerely,
