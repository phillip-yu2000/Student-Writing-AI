Cellphones have become extremely popular in the 20 years. In many ways they are a very helpful devices that provide worldwide communication and interaction. Though, they have also caused trouble in several ways as well. One of said ways is the severe amount of people who are distracted by them while driving.

As phones innovate more and more overtime, so does the amount of people who use them. Phones themselves are not a bad thing, the problem is how people often use them. There are a lot of people who will make text and calls, or even watch videos on their phone while they are driving. Doing this pulls the focus away from driving and causes danger for those who are distracted, and their fellow drivers on the road. On countless occasions people have gotten into accidents and wrecks all because they wanted to text a friend. Often these wrecks are fatal. Something needs to change.

People should not be able to continue driving like this, it isn't safe for anyone. Thankfully, more and more people are also realizing this anger will only grow if nothing is don't, so they helped to make changes. Here recently laws have been passed that make it illegal to be on your phone at all if you are driving a vehicle. Hopefully this will open more people's eyes to the severe danger we face every day without even realizing it.

As helpful as phones may be, people still manage to endanger themselves and others with them daily, and it will not cease until action is taken. Too many people have lost their lives to such a needless issue. And as often as it may happen people still continue doing it, thinking they are safe but anyone who does it is automatically in danger the moment they turn their phone on while behind the wheel.
