Dear principle,

I would like to assert a firm belief that policy number one is the best of both policies. This is due to many reasons. Of which the most important being the following: it gives the children more contact with their parents, it reduces the urge for children to use their phones during class, and it would give children a larger social life. may this essay help you to see what is in my eyes the truth. may you also have everyone's best interest at heart including that of the children.

In the first place, children spend more time with their teachers than with their parents, this is creating a large problem within families. parents have no idea what goes on in their children's school lives. This would make it so that parents would be able to know much more about their children's school lives. this would reduce many house hold problems between parents and children.

In addition, many children use their phones in class due to the fact that they need to socialize. if they would be allowed to use their phones during classless times in the day their overall school performance would increase dramatically. this would also make schools more efficient. this would help many academically struggling children.

Last but not least it would give children a larger social life. social development is a large part of a child's mental growth. the more social they are the better their grades tend to be. this would also effect how well they turn out to do on school testing. this would also lessen school violence, and hatred between students. this would in fact make all schools better and make the world a better place.

in conclusion, the first policy is the best. this is due to the reasons stated above. children that are allowed to use their phones in school at certain times tend to be better than those that aren't. may this lead you to see what i believe is the truth. msy this also lead you to do the best for the child
