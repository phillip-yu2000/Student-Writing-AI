Dear TEACHER_NAME,

To raise the grades for sport participation to a B average is not a good idea. I mean I make good grades but not all "JOCKS" do and that's why they are what they are. It is very hard to keep good grades and win for our school. If you change the grade requirement, the sports participant numbers will indeed decrease rapidly. The students I'm sure work as hard as they can and strive to work, but if you take the only thing that keeps them moving in school it won't be a pretty sight.

As I said the sports team number will decrease, just take one look at all the football, basketball and softball players grades and a lot more than half of them are right at a C average or below it. You also have to think about the parents, they are going to be outrage. Some parents live for their children getting a sports scholarship, do we really want parents complaining?

You also have to think about the time consumption of practices and games after school. Most of the students could be under average because of homework and homework alone. If you were to give sports players test they would most likely do a bit better than the other students because they know the material but like i said homework counts a lot. I mean you cant do homework on the sidelines and if you can focus with all the fans and the screaming than this doesn't apply to you anyway.

The students at this school are great students but they just have a lot on their plate. Just take a few more days to consider the high price and how much you have to lose on this bet and I know you will reconsider, because we are looking for what's better for the school as a whole.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
