In the article " Unmasking the Face on Mars", there has been an argument about whether or whether not it is a natural landform. Some people suggest that it was formed by alien life on Mars and some people believe that it is a natrual landform. I believe it is a natural landform because of what the scientists have found.

The text states, ...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." Not only was the Face formed but it was also and illusion. The text also states, "...snapped a picture ten time sharper than the original Viking photos...revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." The scientists had taken a better picture after they viewed it again proving it was a natural landform. Lastly, although not everyone was satisfied, the scientists had stated, " It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, it's hard work." This shows that just because the supposed "alien markings" were hidden by clouds or haze, doesn't mean they are alien markings. The text states, " It's not easy to target Cydonia...In fact, It's hard work..." So to prove that the " alien markings" was just a natural landform, scientists took a second look and captured the best photo they have and proved that is was just a butte or a mesa which were " common landforms around the American West." This evidence shows that is is a natural landform that is an equivalent to America's common landforms.

I believe that it is a natural landform because of what scientists have found. Scientists have taken pictures and second looks of those pictures to prove that the Face isn't "alien markings", but a natural landform. All this evidence proves that the Face is a natural landform and while my evidence shows something else, there could be evidence that shows it is alien markings. So what is your view on the Face?
