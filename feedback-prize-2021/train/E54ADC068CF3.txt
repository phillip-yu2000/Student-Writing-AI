Driverless cars would be good addition to the world. One of those reasons is that a smart can have better reaction times than a normal human driver. A smart car can also help with traffic jams. Smart cars also make sure the driver is holding onto the wheel and alert at all times.

Automakers used the speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock brakes. Those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Other improvements to make driving are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

BMW announced a smart car that can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. That means that the human driver must be alert at all times and be ready to take over when the situation requires.

A smart car can have better reaction times than a human driver and a smart car can help with traffic jams. Those are just two of the reasons why driverless cars are a good idea.
