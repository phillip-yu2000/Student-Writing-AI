The author seems to be an advocate for studying Venus despite its dangers, and even gives some ideas as to how humans could study Venus without ever touching the extremely volatile surface. The author gives some examples of solutions that the people at NASA have found might be solutions to the problem at hand, and some reasons as to why exploration of our nearest planet is worthwhile.

He talks about one of NASA's many possible solutions, saying "NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.". What he is talking about is a vehicle that would hover above Venus so it would never touch the surface. It's genius! The reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is because "it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.". Even today it has features similiar to that of Earth, like its rocky surface, mountains, and craters. Another possible solution to researching Venus while trying to avoid its harsh terrain is using old technology, used in World War II, and putting this old technology into a new use. The author says the reason these might help the future of exploring Venus because "Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions." these might be more resistant to whats in store for them on Venus.

While the challenges of visiting Venus are certainly disheartening, the value of visiting and exploring Earth's "twin", and one of its closest planets is impossible to know, but the pursuit of knowledge of the planet would make it a worthwhile endeavor. The only thing we know is that impeding danger can not stop our thirst for knowledge, and may even spark it.
