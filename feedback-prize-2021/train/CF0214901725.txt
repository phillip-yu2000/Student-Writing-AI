Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If I were a student from those schools that provides the option to take classes online I will not accept beacuse it requires a computer and that can be a problem if you do not have a computer available. Also when you have classes online is not the same as go to the school beacuse you can understand but it will not be the same as having a teacher explaning everything to you. I am one of the students who prefer assist to the school than having classes online because going to the school can be more beneficial than classes online. Taking classes online can be a good option but also can affect some plans that people might have.

First of all taking classes online requires computer, accces to internet, and other stuff. Some students do not have the opportunities to have a computer and acces to internet and that is why I think that taking classes online can be a problem for those who do not have a computer available.

Second of all having classes online can be succesful but can be a problem for those students who struggle. For those students that struggle more than other I suggest them to go to the school and that will help them to get better and that classes that they are not doling well.

Third of all going to the school can be more productive and benefitial for students than having classes online because students have the opportunity to ask the teacher question at the moment while taking classes online is different beacuse you dont have the opportunity to ask questions that easily as students when they asssit to school.

In conclusion I recommend students to go to the school instead of having classes online because going to the school can be more succesful and that will not affect any of the plans that students might have.
