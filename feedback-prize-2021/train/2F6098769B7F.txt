In my opinion, I would have to say having driverless cars would be a terrific idea. Human error is a way bigger cause of accidents than mechanical failures.

Driverless cars would help prevent a myriad of these accidents that happen around the world.

Drinking and driving is one of the leading causes of death related accidents. These driverless cars wouldn't be affected by an impaired driver. They would be able to get people who are under the influence home safely with a huge reduction in the possibility of that person harming themselves, or anyone else on the streets.

Accidents caused by falling asleep, talking on the phone, texting, and even simply just not paying full attention could all be reduced tremendously with the briliant technological ideas manufacturers are coming up with today. Driverless cars would almost wipe accidents caused by these ways. As stated in the article, "Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road." If they were to put a device like this in their new cars, they could alert a wondering driver that they need to pay attention and that they are in possible danger.

These intelligent cars would cause a huge breakthrough in driver safety. They have the possible impact of turning the common car crash into something rare and not of its time. I believe driverless cars are a fantastic idea and would help save a great deal of lives around the world.
