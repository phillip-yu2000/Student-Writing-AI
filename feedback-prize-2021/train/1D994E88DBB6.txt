The principal wants all the students to paeticipate. In some type of extra activity after school. Such as sports,student council,or the yearbook. Three reasons i agree are that because one , it keeps kids out of trouble, two it could bring alot of people together, three its more healthy for the kids mentally and physically.

One reason i agree with the students doing extra activities is. That it keeps the kids out of trouble. What i mean by trouble is like, some kids may live in bad environments. Which might cause them to stay in trouble with the police all the time. So that is why i think it could help them stay out of trouble. When it comes to extra activities.

A second reason i agree with students doing extra activities is. That it brings alot of people together. What i mean by it brings people together is. That people who may be shy or not so outgoing,could break out of that shell of not. Talking to people as much as they would like to .So that is why i think it brings people together.

The third reason i agree with kids doing extra activities is. That its more healthy for the kids mentally and physically because. When they are around people doing positive things on a daily. It improves peoples performance school wise and social wise. So that is why i think it would be healthy for them mentally and physically.

The principal thinks that students doing extra activities would be a good idea. Everyone has different opinions about it. But three reasons i agree with students doing extra activities are one it keeps them out of trouble, two it brings alot of people together and three its healthy for them mentally and physically. So that is why extra activities is a good idea for students to do.
