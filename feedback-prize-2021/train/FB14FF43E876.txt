Would you agree or disagree with everyone must have an extracurricular activity, I agree and this is why.

I agree with the principal saying everyone must have an extracurricular activity because, it could help lots of people get out of the house a lot more, if they just to have fun and do something, or it could help people talk to and get to know other people.

The reason I say it could help people get out the house more. They may be locked in their house and can't do anything but school. Also they might be doing nothing just sitting in their house.

Even if they just want to have fun and do something. They can just go to school and do a activity. So then you can have fun with your frenids and do what u love.

It would be a good help for some people. They may have insety. They could have a mental problem and needs to talk to someone. They could just sit down and talk to people and get to know other people.

So after reading why I agree. would you or would you not agree with the principal. There are lots of reasons someone would agree those are mine. Some were important reasons and some were not so important.
