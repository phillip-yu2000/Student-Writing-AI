In "The Challenge Of Exploring Venus" the author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents . Some key datails to support the authors claim are that the planets conditions are not survivable for humans to live on despite how earth like it is compared to any other planets in our solar system . " On the planet's surfave, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet" this shows how dangerous it would be to live on this planet and how hard it would be to try to land and get information of anything scientist could study .

"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains,and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel " this shows how earth - like venus is despite how dangerous it is , and the authors claim of studying Venus despite the dangers it presents suggest that the author believes it would be good to gather information about the planet for scientist to study despite the bad conditions so maybe we can make and figure out better technologies to maybe habit this planet in the future .

The challenge of exploring venus is the bad conditions of weather and how it is nothing like our planet and right now at the time , it is not possible to survive in those conditions . Venus is the closing thing to our earth in apperance atleast in our solar system , and if scientist get infomation from landing despite the conditions , we might one day figure out a way to habit the planet in the future .
