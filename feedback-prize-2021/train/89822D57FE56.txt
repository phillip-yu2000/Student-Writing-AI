I think that the policy change would make students want to do better in school so that they could play sports and other stuff. Although, i don't know if every student is capable of getting a B or better. A lot of times students just don't care and if they actually work hard they could do it but sometimes students just can't get higher than a C. Maybe the student has a disease or something wrong with them that they can't but they still want to play sports.

Other activities like dances or parties at the school is something else a student would want to go to. It wouldn't be fair if they are a really good student but they happen to have one C or C+ and they aren't allowed to go.

In conclusion, i feel that the policy should stay the way it is because the kids are still getting an education and are still learning stuff, while they play sports or are involved with other activities.
