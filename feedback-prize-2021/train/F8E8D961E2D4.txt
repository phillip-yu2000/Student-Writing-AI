I support " The Facial Coding System"

because, it would help with alot of different things going on in school. Like for example it could tell what kind of mood the student is in so the teacher could know how to approch them wihtout the student " going off." This would even help with knowing if the student gets the lesson the teacher is teaching by thier facial expressions.

Like i said it helps with alot of differnt things, the author says, " hold on, can we acually "calculate" emotions." yes we can, its a "smart computer" & its like a person. I say its like a person because, say you see your friend and he/she has a frown on her/his face. You auctmactly know theres something wrong because he/shes frowning & thats also what the computer is bacislly doing.

Like the author said " whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions." Faces dont lie and your feelings cant hide. I say that this invention would be great also because of children that get abused at home, & when they come to school they're getting bullied here too. So this is why i support " The Facial Action Coding."
