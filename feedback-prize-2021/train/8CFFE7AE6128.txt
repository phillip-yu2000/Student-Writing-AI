Dear principal

I think that student should keep a c average because that's all some student can maintain is a c average like if i tried out and you had already and put this rule in i would have been kicked out the team for grades because right now I'm failing two out of four class because i don't like trying my best any more but I no iIhave to if I want to pass the 8th grade and go on to high school because I know most of my friends are going there .Sorry there i got of topic there for a second any who as i was saying you cant change to thing to a b because most of the team would be gone and then the football team and the basketball team and the soccer team and even the baseball team and softball team all the sports we all have to give up and take defeat because of your choice you keep it as a c average and win some we lose some or put to a b average and lose them all so its your choice .

Love,
