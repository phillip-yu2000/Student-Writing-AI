In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the driverless cars are not to far from our imagination and dreams. These cars could help us be safer on the road going to work, driving to school, or driving far distinses. These smart cars could help us to not be carles drivers and can help the number of crashes each year go down.

The driverless cars have a long way to go. The cars shoulden't be controlled only 90 percent of the time, and the other 10 percent by human. It would be more dangerous if it was only controlled a tinny percent by man and the rest by semi-autonomous cars. What if the driver gets bored and tired, then he falls aslep and the car needed him to take over? This is why we need a 100 percent driverless car. It would be more safer.

Driverless cars would really come in handy with high schollers just starting to learn to drive. High schollers are very carless drivers, and care more about showing off or trying to have fun then they do about there own safety and everyone elses safety. With these smart cars, new drivers can be more safe. They coulden't be able to show off or maybe even try to go over the speed limite. These smart cars could also be uesful with drunk drivers comming home from a party. Driverless cars have a long way to go, but they can really help us to be saffer and could help crime go down.
