Dear senator,

I belive that we shouldn't keep the Electoral College. The election by popular vote is more fair for electing a president.

First off, going with election by popular vote is more fair. For example, in the article "Does the Electoral College Work?" the author states, " Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So,other things be equal, a large states gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..." Its not fair that small towns/states gets less attention for the president because their opinion and votes dont really matter if they get less attention. Another reason for my argument is, "Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in Califonia. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attentionto the campaign than they would have if the president we picked by popular vote.." Proving that not many people have a say when voting.

In addition, the election by popular vote seems more better. For example, "Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but or a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." Why is it that we arent actually voting for a president? That other people are technically voting for us. If we were to vote by popular vote people would actually feel like they are voting for who they want in office."Consider that state legislatres are technically responsible for picking electors and that those people could always defy the will of the people." So much time goes into election day but for what? We just vote for how we feel but not for who we vote for.

To conclude, people should feel like they have a say when voting. The Electoral College does not seem fair to others. Election by popular vote is way better and is more fair.
