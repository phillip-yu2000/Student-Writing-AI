Dear Principal,

With respect, I think it would be unfair to force teens into community service. I think if you encouraged us a little more, some would find the time for it. Others cannot find the time for it. Some students are taking after school classes such as dance, music, art and other things. Other students have family matters or are piled on with tons of homework that is mandatory to get done.

In all honesty forcing students into community service would only make them angry. They would find ways to get out of it or would pull parents into it. Which would only cause way more problems than the school needs or already has. And that is only a small portion of students.

As for those taking extra curricular classes, they would be just as disappointed. They would most likely have to drop out of those classes to find time for community service. Those students would be upset for having to stop dong something they enjoy for something they are pushed into. Which again would bring parents into the picture.

Those with family matters such as sick relatives or far away relatives would probably be more sad than anything. Being pulled away from the extra time they have to go visit family is now being put in to community service.

This would put more unwilling students into community service.

Plus, those with tons of homework who are struggling to get it all finished are struggling more. Having to work harder because they don't have as much time as they used to. This leads to grades dropping and suddenly A and B students failing.

In my opinion, students should have the right to decide for themselves to participate or not. That means less drama for the school and more happy teens. Which is fantastic news for you. I hope this helps you in your decision.

Sincerely, Anonymous Student
