there are many types of transportation but I'm sure all of us can agree cars are the most used type. evey home has one or two cars at least in their driveway. Imagine a world where there are no cars though. everyone takes public transportation or walks to where they need to be. Vauban, Germany is trying soemthing like this.

In source one: "In german Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars." the writer Elizabeth Rosenthal states that they got rid of street parking, driveway and home garages are forbiden. The streets a re completely car-free except the main thoroughfare. Now, seventy percent of families do not own cars anymore and fifty-sevem percent sold a car to move there. People consider this "smart planning" i would too actually there are manty other cities who are trying to be "car-free." Most people like it and are enjoying it. They believe it could be a very good important serious change.

In the second source: "Paris bans driving due to smog"Â  it not only helps pollution but also lives. if someone is driving with smog on their windows its just an accident waiting to happen because you can't see the cars or people around you. It also, get ready its a big one saves coffe! Don't drink it just smell.
