Dear Principal,

I, STUDENT_NAME an eighth graders of SCHOOL_NAME has heard of your considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have a B grade average. What you don't know is that many of us students have a C grade average. my point is that your changing our school policy might be unfair. Why,

you might ask? there are many reasons why.

TEACHER_NAME, if you were to change the school policy it might be difficult to maintain a B grade average because some of us students might have difficulties in one class and might need a little help in one lesson that they didn't understand. but that isn't a real reason to kick a person off the team, that is really unfair because maybe the sport or activity is what the person has passion for. Its like trying to take a bottle away from a baby when its hungry. I myself am very passionate about soccer, soccer is an active and painful sport but its what i love doing, just feel that rush of adrenaline run through your veins and being able to say "I wona gold metal because I was in the forward." Every person wants to complete this phrase

"I'm proud of myself because

..."

Another reason why you shouldn't change the school policy is because doing sports isn't something you do to be active or to have fun. One does it because of the benefits that come from sports.

Many girls enjoy figure skating because its not only a sport , its because they feel beautiful and graceful. Ever sport shows you how you can feel better about yourself. If you were to change school policy most students believe that they cant reach the standrad of having a B grade baverage
