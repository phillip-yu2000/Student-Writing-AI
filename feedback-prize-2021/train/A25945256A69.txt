The limiting of cars in our community can help us significantly reduce pollution, save money, and improve health.

To begin with, the amount of pollution caused by cars has dramatically effected the enviroment. Acording to the text the capital of France in only five days of car smog. The amount of smog riveled to the smog capital of the world Beijing, China. That was only five days of car smog. If we keep this up, the  first the sky will turn black and then it will fall and world will end! Hopefully nobody wants the world to end because of smog. To reduce the amount of smog and pollution caused by cars we can all reduce the usege of our cars. Therfore, the limiting of cars can significantly reduce pollution.

Next, limiting cars can help us all save money. To illustrate, we all like that "Cash Money". And all cars need gas to work, and the funny thing about gas is it cost money; alot of money actually. So if the limited useage of cars happen then, is we save that "Cash Money". As you can see the reduction and limiting of cars can save us that "Cash Money".

Lastly, the limit of car useage can and will improve health by making people walk. You see people every where are getting over weight. So by makeing them walk or use other modes of transportation we can lose weight and improve health. Thus, the limiting the useage of cars can and will increase health.

To conclude, the limiting of cars in our community can help us significantly reduce pollution, save money, and improve health.
