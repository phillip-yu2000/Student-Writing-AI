Dear Principal,

I think it's wrong to take away the advantage of students to participate in any kind of school sports/ activities.

Why cant you change the school policy so that kids can participate with at least a C average?

Some students can have all A' s in their classes and not be athletic.

They can be "obese " but with good grades.

Other kids might have a grade C average and be really athletic and if u take away their privilege they will not have time to take away the "stress" from school, to just forget about school and have fun.

Of course if you put up the standard they have to have in order to participate maybe they will try harder than what they usually try and get a B or even an A.

But that will just stress them even more. With a grade of B average only a certain amount of students will be eligible to participate.

But with a grade C average more kids will be able to go to different activities that the school does.

If the school has activities or sports shouldn't all kids be able to enjoy them?
