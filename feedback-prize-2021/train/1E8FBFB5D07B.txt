Dear Principal,

I understand that you are thinking about requiring every student to need to take part in community service. While i do think that everyone should take part in it, i don't think it should be required.

First, I would like to point out that yes, community service does teach children that there are things that need to be done in our community and it does also teach good character. But, not every child has parents that are able to take them to do their community service because most parents work. For example, my parents own their own business and yes they can just close it when ever they need to but, you also have to realize that if they are out taking me to do my community service their store is not open and when it isn't open they do not make money. If students can not make it to their community service and it is required, i don't think that is fair to make then suffer a punishment or have a lowered grade just because they had no way of getting there.

Secondly, I do think that there are some children out there that want to do something to make a difference in their community but not all children want to. Wouldn't you much rather make some sort of sign up sheet for the children that actually want to participate? Some kids would take doing community service as a punishment and maybe they might act disrespectful during their time serving.

Lastly, not all students have the time after school to do community service. I know for example, that i am willing to do community service but i have volleyball six days a week after school. I know i do have one day a week off but i would rather take that one day off.

Thank you for listening to my ideas, i hope that i have made an impact of your decision.

sincerely, student
