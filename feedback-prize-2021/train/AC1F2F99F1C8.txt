Have you ever known how if feels not being able to breath? If you haven't then you probably will someday. Breathing is something every living thing has to do to survive. At that another question. Have you ever made the connection between driving and breathing? Pollution is the connection, in europe twelve percent of the green house gases are from the muffler.

In the extreamest of places like Beijin there is so much exhaust in the air that you can see it. They call this smog, smog is very dangerous, breathing large amounts could easily lead to lung cancer. People all around the world are looking for the solution to this horrible problem. Hybrid cars some say, others solve the problem and live in car free comunities.

There are great advantages to car free comunities. The main dis advantage being that if you have to travel far you would have to use public transportation. The main advantages are that there is no car exhaust in the air. Also there is no road rage or traffic jams to worry about. Car-less comunities are spreading and one day we might factor out car exhaust as pollution and as a problem.

In major cities like paris they couldn't ban all driving so they compromised and made limitations on driving and giving small fines to non cooaperating drivers. congestion went down sixty percent in Paris in five days of limited driving. If we all just try and limit our driving a little we could help everyone breath a little better. If we control it now we could get rid of the issue before we are fined like the four thousand in France that week. Next time you jump in your car and fire the engine up take time to think about who you could keep from breathing fresh air; maybe one day it could happen to you.
