Hey everybody I'm Luke Bomberger and I'm here to convince you to join the

"Seagoing Cowboys program,I am going to list reasons why you should join by telling you my excpriecnces .I've had good and bad ones but at the end it was the best choice I've made.

One reason is that you get to help many people and animals have a better and here is my example,It took about two weeks to cross the the alantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China .Caring for animals during the crossings kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled upfrom the lower holds of the ship,Also stalls had to be cleaned.

Another reason is that you get to venture around the world and see many different things and places,like I got to see Europe and china,but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special to me.

And one final example is that as you venture around the world and take care of animals you also get more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

I think that this would be a great opportunity for you guys and you also get see many different places and people and thier countries.
