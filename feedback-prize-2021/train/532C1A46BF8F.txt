I think that the smart cars would be really cool to have. I think if we have these car some people, like me, may actually want to drive. Some people have a fear of driving, and I think these cars could be a good way to help with that fear. I have this fear because of the car accident in my family.

Another note that would have it be more helpful is help older people to drive. My great grandma never learned how to drive. If these cars were here just maybe it could help her get out of the house more. Many people think that if you get in a car accident, while the smart car is driving the manufacturer should be punished. I don't think this because you still have to stay alert when something is coming up. One other thing I can think of is that the car is not fully driverless. This to some people is a downfall, but to me I think it is awesome. The shows that we are getting lazier by the day. The author states, "... but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires the human skills, such as navigating through work zones and accident... the humn driver must remain alert and be ready to take over." This to me is a major downfall to the car. Driver should still be resposible for any damage that is done to another person or other car. If you are going to drive make sure you focus on the road head and leave the phone alone till you get to your destination or home.

I still think the smart cars are going to be a big thing. Even though it has its downfalls, I think that they will help wth a few issuse. It can maybe helo people get over their fear of driving, or teach older people to drive. But if they do become driverless, I think the driver should still be held responsible.
