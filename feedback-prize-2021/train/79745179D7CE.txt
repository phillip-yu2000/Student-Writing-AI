It is good to get advice from more than one person. Why, well first of all someone could give you bad advice or the wrong advice that is going to get you in trouble. Then someone could give you okay advice but it could always be better. You could use there advice and it could help but it could also still cause you to get in trouble or it could solve the problem but still not be great. Lastly you would have more options to make the right choice if you only have one opinion on what to do again it might not be the right choice and having more is way better. You also have more understanding of what you could do or what you could do but it would get you in more trouble.

For example i got bad advice one time and i lost some of my really good friends because i thought it would be smart to listen to him. So now i know to have more options because i made a mistake on one having one opinion on what to do.

Another example i was invited to a really cool place, but didnt know if i should go so asked for advice. i got bad advice okay advice and really good advice. I knew not to pick the bad but not sure if the okay was good enough so i picked it and never went it was crazy but it thought me to usually go with the good advice.

Having options can help you or the people around you so you dont make the mistake of having bad advice. thats why you ask for more opinons on things and you could even give good advice and tell them to also ask more people.

So, you should always have more than one option or advice to make it more helpful to you or the people around you and have better choices for things in life.
