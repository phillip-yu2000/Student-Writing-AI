won't it be so cool to have a car that drives itself. In "Driverless Cars Are Coming"

the author talks about cars that will drive theirselves. i do believe it will be cool to have cars that will drive thierself, but they are unsafe.

the car can hit the breaks by theirselves and drive you to where you want to go. the car will be creaper on gas and will help our world to not die. that's not all, just think about all of the jobs taht the united States can have, if we build the cars here. the driver of the car will have something to noticify them if there is danger up ahead. also there will be least accident with droke driviers.

however, there is a bad slide to the driving cars. the car can't drive in construction sites and accident. also if you get hurt in a car wrack the driver driving at the time could be sued. the company that made the car will not take full responiblity for your car wrack. plus the car will cost so much in inscurate and buying the car itself. the families buy it will go broke. also, how can they tell when someone is in front of them? the united state is very lazy, why will we get cars to help us with our laziest?

in the "diverless cars are coming", it talks about self driving cars. the Cars will help people get jobs, if made in the united states. but the cars are not safe to drive in an accident or working site. the self driving car will be cool but their is a bad slide to them. i am in the medium with the self driving cars.
