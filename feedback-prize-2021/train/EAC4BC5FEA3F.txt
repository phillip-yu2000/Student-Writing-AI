Hi I am Luke and I was in a job on a boat called a cattle boat. I was on the boat for about two years and it was amzing. The job is all about getting cattle acores the oceans to other countres because of World War II.

The Nazies done a lot of work to destroy theso countery and they need food and supplys to get back on their feet and they make a great counrty once again. This job in opioun is the best because we get to go to other countris and give them supplys for them to get back on their feet to once great again. I did this for two years straight and had a blast and we even got so much free time that I got to take a tour around a caltle on our way to chine and I had a blast also got see Greece and other amzaing conutries. I also I got a trip to italy and got to ride the strits of their beatful town. So this was a good trip for me a small-town city boy. On the way home we got to play sports like baseball, vollyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing reading whittling, and games to pass the time for the two years. But I do got to warn you about the danger about this job when I had the late night shift I had to check the animals every hour and one hour I fell back in if that railing was not their I would of been lost at sea and I would of dron out their if it was not for that railing.

So this jobeis good ofr some people if they wanted to see the world and to sail around the world and have a adventure and exting two years about cattle boating but keep in mind it is very dangers to cattle boatign so that is some reason to cattle boating and so I hope you would like this job.
