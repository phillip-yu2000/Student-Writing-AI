STUDENT_NAME

dear TEACHER_NAME

Well its not a bad idea because in high school u need a b average to play sports so why no middle school. It will teach students how to be responsible when they want to a sport there has to be certain rules in school. So if u made it on the team but it will be pretty hard to stay on it if u a bad student. So try it teach ur student how be in high school before there even there.

also its will teach me not to slack off in class. Anther important thing to notice TEACHER_NAME

that a very good way for a young adult to learn how to focus better not just on the sport but in school sports as well. One more thing kids need to learn that school is the main reaosn why u get to collage. so try it u may learn something because el learn something if u do that.
