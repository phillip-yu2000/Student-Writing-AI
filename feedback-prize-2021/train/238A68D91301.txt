I think students being able to attend classes from home would benefit them greatly. Some kids struggle with getting out of bed in the morning, which causes a problem with poor attendance. With long distance learning that won't even be an issue. The students would also feel more comfortable in their own home. And there are many more benefits that come with long distance learning. For example, they could do it on their own time, this could be way for student to get ahead, because sometimes in classrooms kids feel that the paste is too slow. The kids that feel that the classes go too slow tend to get bored and boredom causes behavior problems, with online classes that won't be the case because it's at your own paste, they can go as fast as they want. Another benefit would be their eating schedule, typically eating in class is prohibited and that made students upset because theres no way they can control when they get hungry, At home they are free to have their regular eating schedule without it being a problem. Long distance learning also benefits the parents, Dropping off and picking up their children can be a hassle, attending online classes this issue is taken out of the picture completely. When their child gets sick at school they have to take off from their jobs to go get them, which is a really big inconvenience to the parents. These examples shows you that a significant amount of problems that would occur with going to school would be eliminated by attending online classes.
