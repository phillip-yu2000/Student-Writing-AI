When it comes to reducing the amount of cars, in any given area, there is multiple advantages. There are many up sides to it, it has a few downsides such as not being able to car far distances...but thats exactly where public transportation comes in. One great advantage to limited car usage is the reduced amount of obesity. When you dont have a car your only other options would be to walk, bike, skate, etc. which helps you lose weight. Not only that, but more parks and sport centers are being constructed. What about traffic? No one likes traffic, so by reducing the amount of cars in a given area, there will be close too no traffic at all. You'd be able to get to work or school on time, not have to worry about finding a parking spot, and generally get to where you need to be in a quicker amount of time. Pollution is as big of a problem as traffic, if not bigger. Many people claim that cars are the main source of air pollution along side with plants. Well, by taking away cars our air will be much fresher and more pleasant to breathe.
