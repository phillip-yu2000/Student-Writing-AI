Dear, State Senator

The voting of the president every four years is one of the most important events of American history. However I feel that it has become unfair and a volatile way of voting.

I believe that we the people should rid ourselves of the electoral college and turn to the popular vote instead. Too many events concerning the need for this change have been caused by the electoral college. Even Nixon who was caught up in a electoral vs. popular vote dispute said "aboilish the electoral college.".

First and foremost the fact that the peolpe do not vote for the president is a worying factor when the presidential election comes around. The people vote on an electoral slate of electors who may or may not actually vote for the president you want perhaps deciding to "defy the will of the people"from source 2 and vote against their political party. also you dont have the power to decide which candidates will be running so the people who will vote for your president are possibly unrelateable politicians who may be waiting to turn against the political party they belong to. there is the very likely posibility based on the information in source 2 staing that "During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states diddnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets diddnt get to see a single coampaign add.". personally I dont know how anybody would be able to make the correct descision when electing a elector based on what you may hear about them from a friend a couple states over who may or may not have seen the candidates. Although highly unlikely, a tie in the electoral college would mean the unbalancing of power between states.

overall the electoral college is unfair and needs to be replaced by the will of the people and not the will of a masked politician.
