Dear Principal,

I am arguing with the principal by playing sports or activities unless they have a B average. I say this because a C average is satisfactory. Which is not really good. If students want to do sports or activities and they want to get a B or higher, this makes the students work more harder to get up to a B or higher and play sports. So it is putting pressure on them to work more harder. The students have the privilege to participate in sports , it has to come with requirements. Also by changing the policy , students will have a good grade and they are doing sports or activities. They will not have to worry about there grade a B instead of C or lower. This will make students achieve higher and make their school very proud of getting A' s and B' s. The students will have good confidence about your grades and being on the sports team. This is why I am arguing with the principal by playing sports or activities unless they have a B average.
