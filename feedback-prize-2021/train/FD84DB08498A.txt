Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I would just like to say that I think changing the policy is a bad idea for many reasons. One reason would be because, most students play sports to get things off their minds to make the grades they are. Plus taking things they enjoy away will just stress them out and make them mad of course you may still think this is a good solution but us children think differently. The people that play sports will find a way to one way or another. Lest they be heard they will revolt and take action. Also if many students have a C average then we would just not have very good and mighty teams you might as well take out all sports and just say we aren't going to have any sports but then if you did that I could almost ensure you that we would only have people at our school that could care less about sports which is very few. Now if you changed the policy where students with a C average could play then that would be efficient and reasonable because C is passing and I think everyone could agree with if you don't have a C average then you shouldn't play. Another reason why I don't agree is because we would have a lot more fights most scholars play sports to get their anger out and so that would just cause even more conflicts and then it would go to suspension and so on and so forth. I really hope you understand what I am trying to say and take my advice into deep consideration then maybe our school will be more successful.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME :)
