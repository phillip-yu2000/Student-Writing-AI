I think it is a good idea because if someone is feeling like he or she wans to kill their selves that the computer will pick it up and you can get help for that person. Then you can tell if someon is having a good day and you can joke around a little. If you could tell if someone was not happy you could try to do something to make them happy. It can tell you six basic emotions. It can pick up on a lot of your emotions. It can help you figer out what you are felling. If you find out what your friend is feeling you could help them feel different. If someone is strugling with depression you could find it out with your computer and then tell them that you know what they are going through and that they need to go talk to a person who can help them cope with their depression. I think it would be fun to just expirement on people to see if they like me or not. The computer is able to take a picture of you and tell what you are feeling by looking at your face muscle.
