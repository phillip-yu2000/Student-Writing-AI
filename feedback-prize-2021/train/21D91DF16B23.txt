The technology to read students' emotional expressions known as the "Facial Action Coding System" is helpful and valuable. The advanced technology could help modify a lesson on a computer when a student is showing signs of boredom, help with communication skills, and tell whether or not a person or celebrity is lying due to facial muscles.

In paragraph 6 the article explains how if the "Coding System" were to be in computers in classrooms, it could help modify lessons for students who get bored. Dr. Huang states "a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor," and this technology could help "make computer animated faces be more expressive for video games and video surgery." Also in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too." meaning that in day to day life humans interact by facial movements or gestures so if computers could read those expressions and gestures, life could be made easier. Finally, in paragraph 8 it reads "muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risouris." showing how "these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful." So in the classroom if a student was being untruthful the computer would be able to detect when the student is lying due to their facial muscles.

In conclusion, the technology to read students' emotional expressions known as the "Facial Action Coding System" is helpful and valuable. The advanced technology could help modify a lesson on a computer when a student is showing signs of boredom, help with communication skills, and tell whether or not a person or celebrity is lying due to facial muscles.
