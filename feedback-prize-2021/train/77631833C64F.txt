Dear Senator

The Electoral College

process was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The Electoral college

consists of the selection of electors.

The electoral college

consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. I am arguing for the change of  the electoral college in the favor of changing it to the election of popular vote. I believe that if the people were given the chance  to vote for president the outcome would differ. As it stands the president is elected by the electoral college. If the people were tasked with voting for the president then they would choose who they want. Not who the electors want. The electors vote for whoever would look good for office. That means that the president wont always do whats right for America. The people desevre to choose the president. In a way it would be giving the people more freedom. If

the electoral college

stayed the way it is then americans would feel the freedom they were born with.

The electoral college

wouldnt be needed if the government allowed qualified citizens to vote. It would save quite a bit of money and time. We wouldnt be wasting paper for ballots. The resources used to set up voting booths could be targeted at something else instead of wasting paper that will be thrown away. The votes from american citizens are not taken into consideration. We are wasting many resources making people think they are voting when its really all up to

the electoral college

to who the president will be. I strongly agree with the fact that

the electoral college

should be taken out of power. If

the electoral college

stays in the power of deciding who the president will be then they can control the power. They decide who to put in office and if they want someone who will pass health care laws then theyll pick the presidential candidate that will most likely pass health care laws. In the future I hope that the electoral college will not exist. If

the electoral college

no longer exists then the people will be free to vote for whoever. This will make american citizens feel more free if they have the power to decide who the next president will be.

Sincerely

PROPER_NAME
