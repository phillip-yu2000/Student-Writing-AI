Some schools require the students to do a project during the summer to assure that the students are still learning during the break. I think that is dumb because the kids are supposed to have a break from school during the summer but i am going to side with the student designed projects. The reason i am siding with student designed is because i am a student myself and I know that students are able to make projects that are fun and still show that They are continuing to learn while they are not at school. One big example of students working on a project they designed is a science project they are not told what to do in it or how to do it by a teacher all they know is decide what to do, then get the materials, then execute the project and then bring it back to school so that goes to show that students can decide what to do for their project. Some people may say that, teachers need to design the students projects so they need to know what to do so they don't get off track but however they are wrong because there are a lot of bright students that don't need a teacher's help with a lot of things and im pretty sure that they don't need help on deciding on something as simple as a project that can be anything that they want.

Schools that don't let the students decide on anything are holding them back on what could be their next future job or career, so schools that let students decide on things are trying to help them reach that potiental so they could decide for themselves on a lot of thing and don't have to have someone tell them they have to do this a certain type of way so at the same time its not just letting them decide on what they want to do for a project they are giving them the freedom to decide what they want to do so when they leave school there is no one that have to tell them what to do every step of the way. But for the schools that have to decide for the students everyday without letting them choose for themselves that is not really helping the students really because when they have to do something by themselves they are going to need someone to coach them through life and show them simple things that could be easily understood but the can't do that be cause in school they had someone to do all deciding for them.

In conclusion, let the students decide their projects so they can do something for themselves and not have the assignment handed to them. The IB personal project can be used for another example of a student designed project. With the IB personal project it takes months because it requires a lot of steps for each individuals project, first you have to plan and decide what you are going to do for that project, second you have to execute the plan and keep up with it so you can write about it, third you have to write a 3000 word paper about the project explaining what you did and how you did it, fourth you have to print out everything you did and put it on a poster board, and finally you have to wait until march 17 for the IB person project fair where you have to present your project to all the family members and friends that will be attending. Some people may say that just because you let students decide what they are goign to do with a project doesn't mean that they wont be depending on someone to help them in life but however they are wrong because that little piece of freedom to decide what they are going to do on a project is getting one step closer to be a self depending person.
