There are some advantages of limiting car usage. There would be less air pollution, you wouldn't have to worry about gas, and there wouldn't be as much smog in the air, as it is now. Not having a car isn't all that bad.

With pollution in the air, it would cause people to have health problems. You probably couldnt breath as well as you should be able to. There's a chance you could end up getting sick, and dying. You'd pretty much be at risk for alot of things.

With the change in the economy, gas prices are up and down, and it's stressful trying to fill up your car having to spend so much money, when you have a family to take care of. Alot of people struggle with things like this situation, including bills. It wouldnt hurt to walk, or to take the bus to work. If you actually think about all the money you spend, using a car, you would realize that you could save much money by not having one. Maybe one day your car could start acting up and you would have to take it to the shop. Just imagine how much it would cost to fix it.

As the years past by, fewer cars are getting sold, and fewer people are getting their liscense. They same cars are sitting in the parking lot at the car dealership place, because nobody wants to buy them. Others can't afford them. Some researches are beginnning to think that America has passed peak drving. "The United States,with its broad expanses, and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures".

In conclusion, vehicles and other motor prodcuts would make a HUGE difference, if we didnt have them. There would be less air pollution and smog, people wouldn't worry or have to stress over gas money, and the more money you have, the less problems you'd have to deal with.
