I think that the students should not be required to perform community service. My opinion is that we should just not litter at all. Maybe if some students want to perform community service, then they can do it on there own time for extra credit or something. Also if the principal wants, the school can set up an elective for a community service class or they can go on a field trip to help, or tutor elementray kids or pick up trash and litter. At my old school, I was in an AVID class. Every week, we were required to do forty-five minutes to an hour of community service. That would be a good idea for an elective of some sort. For the kids that do not want to perform community service, then its there choice. Maybe they may not have the time for it but I do not speak for them. If our principal decides not to require all students to perform community service, then in return, we will do our best not to litter, and do our part. If the principal does decide to require all students to perform community service, then there is nothing we can do.
