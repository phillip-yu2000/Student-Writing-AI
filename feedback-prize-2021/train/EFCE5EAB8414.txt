To the senator of our state,

The electoral college makes a big impact on our voting system. However, it needs to be changed or even abolished. The manner in which the eletoral college funtions is not fair to the public. By the time you've finished this letter I hope you'll have taken my suggestion to mind.

For one the electoral college makes voting feel unvalidated. It should be the public themselves that choose the president, not a signifigantly smaller group of people. This was the case in the 2000 election, when Al Gore was not elected even though he had a popular vote of 60 percent. This gives many people the mindset that if their votes will be overuled by the electoral college, then that gives them less of a motivation to vote.

This brings us to my next point. If the electoral college is abolished, than more people will want to vote. Now, the public's opinion is just as important as the college's in our current system, but there would most deffinately be a increase in the number of votes if this system was deystroyed. What drives people to vote in the first place is that they want their opinion to be heard, so the electoral college is preventing their opinions from being heard.

Another reason to abolish the electoral college is that I don't think that many people know it exists in the first place or at the very least know how it works. If more people were given the explanation from these articles, they would probably feel the same way; that their votes no longer mean anything by the time election day comes.

To conclude, the electoral college is an outdated concept in our federal system. It should be abolished so that the public will have a greater sense of purpose when they vote. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my suggestion.
