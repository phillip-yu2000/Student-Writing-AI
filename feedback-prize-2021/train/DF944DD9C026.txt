Dear Principal:

The ability to have cell phones on school campus is not the best idea. Kids can cheat on tests without the teachers knowing. Sometimes teachers trust the students that they wont text in class, but kids can break that rule. Yes, sometimes it is nice to have your cell phone out for a calculator (if you are allowed to use one) or even to call your parents if there is a big emergency happening at the school, but kids ruin the advantage that they get for being able to have their cell phones out.

Since I a' m a student at a SCHOOL_NAME, i think it will be awesome to be able to have your phones out during break times. The only thing wrong with that is kids will have their cell phones on in classes and text when they are not supposed to. If i was sitting next to a student that texts non stop during class time, it would be very annoying. So not only is it rude for students to text while their teacher is speaking, but also can be disturbing to students around the person that's texts while they are trying to do class work.

If you can only have your phones out during break time and not during class session that wont be a hard problem for some student to listen to. Some students will listen to that rule and teachers can trust them; but there are still students out there that will text during times that they are not allowed to.

In conclusion, students should not be allowed to have their cell phones on school grounds. If they were allowed to have their phones, then they would text during classes which is rude to the teacher; and they also won't learn anything if they were texting.
