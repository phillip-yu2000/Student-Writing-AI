How do driveless cars sound? Driverless cars do sound like a good idea, having them take the wheel for you and not have the hard tasks of revesing when you can not see behind you, parallel parking, and not worrying about the speed you are going when the car can do it for you. The problem I see is that if another driverless car starts on its own and drives away without you, where does it go? Another problem would be that if another driverless car comes into your way and you both crash into each other who do you blame the person driving the car because they were not in control or the manufacturers for not programming the car correctly to avoid collisions like this? What would happen if we did get into an accident? Would we be likely to live or more likely to die because we couldn't control the vehicle?

Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws would be needed in order to cover the liability in case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?

All in all I just think we need to test this one out a little more, because just like smart cars they are not accident proof, they are not safty assured, and they are not likely going to save me or anyone else that would be in the car it would more likely kill us then save us or if we are saved injure us badly.

Not only that but what would the driveless car use regular gas or be an electric car? I already know this as well, but there will be protest about this car working or that this car is just another one of those future cars we are not ready for and so forth, how will we promote this so that people will buy this car knowing it is probably bad for the environment? Those are just some questions to think about so just give them some thought and that is why I think we should not have driverless cars.
