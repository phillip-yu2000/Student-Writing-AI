Dear Principal,

I don't quite agree with the new policy that you are considering. I understand where you are coming from. That not being able to play sports with a C average, students will want to do better. But this goal might be too high for some students, and some students might just give up and not even try. With all due respect, I think that a B average is too unreasonable.

Also since majority of the students already have a C average then the sports team will not have enough students to play, so some students my not even want to play since the teams are so small.

I think it would be more fair students with a D or F average can't play, but I think students with a C average should be able to participate.

I myself have an A average and I know that sometime I have bad days and get a bad grade and that might be the difference between a B and a C.

Sincerely,

Student
