The principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Students would love to do something they enjoy doing at the end of the day. For example, students could participate in sports, do photography for the year book, or pick up trash around the school. Students would enjoy doing a extracurricular activity because students can get more exercise, students could do something they enjoy, and they could help the environment.

When playing sports, students get more exercise. When students don't do extracurricular activities they are more likely to sit on their couch and watch TV. Students don't get any exercise when doing that, instead they can do a after school sport and get much more exercise. It is healthy for students to get moving and stay active, if they don't they could get to an unhealthy weight.

Students could do something they enjoy doing. For example, students could do photography for the year book, they could do their favorite sport, or do drawing classes. Students could also make new friends while doing these extracurricular activities. Some students don't want to do after school activities because they think there're a waste of time, but they are wrong. How can it be a waste of time when you are doing something you love?

Students could help the environment. The environment is in bad shape right now because all of the trash on the floor. It would be a huge help to the environment and the school if students stayed back after school to pick up trash around the school.

The principal should defiantly let students participate in at least one extracurricular activity because student get more exercise, students can do something they enjoy doing, and they can help the school and the environment. Students may not want to do extracurricular activities because they think they're not good at it. But if they practice hard and give it 110 percent they will defiantly be good.
