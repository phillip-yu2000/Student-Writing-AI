Dear State Senator,

We should stop using the Electoral College and change to popular vote.  It's unfair that we aren't actually voting on the president we want and that it goes by what the electors want.  Popular vote is fair because we the voters pick what we want.

Is the Electoral College a good system?  I think not, I mean it's no where near fair.  The electors vote on who they want not what the people want.  Everyone wants to be able to pick who they want for president and not have their vote be wasted on a couple of old dudes who don't think the way we do.

Popolar vote is better.  The people go vote who they want and the only reason the person they voted for doesn't win it's because he wasn't as popular as the other canidate.  Our president should be elected because the people of United States of America chose them.  Why would we leave are votes to the hands of electors?  We shouldn't.
