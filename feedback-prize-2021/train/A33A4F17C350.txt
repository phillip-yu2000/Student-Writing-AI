Dear Principal,

Lots of people have cell phones for no purpose. Some people also have cell phones for a purpose. Some people have cell phones because it is fun to text in class, while other people have cell phones because they need to call their parents or plan something with their friends outside of school. I am trying to say that it is not a good thing to allow people to text or call in class, but people should be allowed to do it a little bit so they can connect with their parents or form a party. Basically, I am all for policy one.

Kids are usually allowed cell phones because their parents want to connect with them. What parents don't know is what the kids do when they get the cell phone. Some kids obey the rules and call their parents once in a while, and they don't distract themselves and other people in class by texting. Other kids, on the other hand, don't care about calling their parents and text in class, distracting themselves, and other people. That's when policy one comes in. Kids won't be able to distract themselves and others in class, and they won' t be able to text at lunch either because they want to eat. Maybe,

they might even call their parents for once and tell them what's happening.

For the kids that follow the rules, this should be easy. They are already doing what policy one is all about. They already know that they would distract other people by texting in class so they don't do it. They already call their parents during lunch to communicate. You shouldn't worry so much, principal, for policy one works for everyone, even you.
