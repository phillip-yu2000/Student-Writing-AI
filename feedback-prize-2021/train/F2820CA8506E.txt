I think that they should get rid of the electoral college, becuase each person shoule just be able to vote who they want to be president, instead of having to vote on someone and then they represent your and they vote on the president of the united states. One of the other reasons i think the electoral college should be Abolished is that for instence say you voted for a elector, well that elector you voted for could always pick someone else instead of who you thought that they were going to pick for president. Another reason that i belive they should get rid of the electoral college is that acording to the article by

The Office Of Federal Register

. most states have a "winner take all system" which awards all electors to the winnong presidential canidate. When you go to vote, you shouldnt have to pick an elector to elect who you want to be the new President Of The United States Of America, when you go to vote, you should just pick who you want to be president, so that you dont have to rely on someone picking who you want to be the Pesident.
