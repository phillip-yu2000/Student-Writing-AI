In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile." by Nick D'Alto he is talking about a new Facial Action Coding System. This coding system detects the emotions a person is feeling at the time. They rely on the muscles from your face to tell them what emotions you are feeling. Their are six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Classrooms and schools should not use this technology for multiple reasons.

Classrooms should not use this technology for more than one reason. First of all in classrooms all over the world there are teachers, and those teachers are just trying to give there students the education they need. So when there is a computer operated coding system in there telling you the emotions of all your students every ten minutes that might be a big distraction, ecspeacially for the students. Can you imagine a classroom full of first graders trying to get anything done when there is practically a robot in there classroom? Another reason why this technology should not be used is for the students sake; maybe they like to keep there emotions to themselves and not be told how they are feeling.

Finally the cost to install or buy one of these for every classroom would probably be threw the roof.

In conclusion, classrooms should just rely on the teachers to do there jobs and ask a kid what there emotions are if needed. Now maybe in the future this could be a good experiment to test out, but for now things are fine as is. Because technology has brought us so far, it is hard to completly go aganist but everything comes with time and im sure this will to.
