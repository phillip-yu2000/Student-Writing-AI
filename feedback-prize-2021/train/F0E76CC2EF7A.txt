I disagree that all students must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may have other plans or don't want to do an extra activity. Students may have different plans for there future and want to work on what they want to do. Some students want to focus on graduating school.

It also may cause problems on most students. Students want to do less work at a time. Doing an extra activity may cause students to panic with a lot of work to do.

Another reason I disagree that all student must participate in at least one extra curricular activity because students may not like that there is a lot of activity they have to choose from. Most students like to do things on there own or at home on there bed or personal space. Many students don't like to do activity with other people around them and going with what the teacher wants them to do.
