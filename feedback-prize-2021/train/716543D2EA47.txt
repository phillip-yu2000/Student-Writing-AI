Dear state senator, I strongly disagree with the Electoral College. In my opinion, it is extremely unfair to voters. Candidates don't even spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning because of the winner-take-all system. They only focus on the tight races in the "swing" states, which isn't very fair at all.

Also, it is outdated. We need something new, something way better. Not all of the states even seen the candidates at all and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And to me, that isn't very good at all. They all should be able to see the candidates and all the media markets should be able to see a campaign ad.

The article "The Indefensible Electoral College; Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"  written by Bradford Plumer, he states that "The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best." I agree with Bob Dole! Abolish the electoral college! It's unfair, outdated, and even irrational. In my opinion, there is absolutely nothing good about it.
