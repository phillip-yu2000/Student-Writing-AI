Phones & Driving

Should people be able to use their phones in any capacity while driving? They should. Should people have complete access to their phones while driving? No, some of the features on phones should not be accessible while driving. Is there danger with using a phone while driving? Yes, there is, but the danger is in most of what is done on a regular day basis.

Why should people have accessibility to phones while driving? People should be able to because it is their property. Someone can not deny someone the usage of something they bought with their own money. A salesman can't sell someone a fork and plate and tell them not to eat. The salesmen can tell the consumer the ups and downs of their product. Then it becomes that person´s choice or whether or not they want to take that risk. It is all about personal limits.

Stating that danger shouldn't be prevented is idiotic. But someone's argument against something should not be the dangers of it. Everything, including phones and driving, are dangerous in themselves, but the more they are done, the worst they get. With this being known, would someone try to prevent people from drinking water because some people have died from doing so. No, they would allow them the knowledge of the dangers and allow them to set their limits. The exact same thing should be done for phones while driving.

This essay keeps stating that to limit the person's usage. Nothing can be entirely prevented because people will do as they please. But if you set limits, more people are subjectable to follow such limits. They are even more willing to do so knowing the dangers or consequences of their actions. Finally, let people govern themselves. It is not one person´s nor is it a group of people´s choice on whether someone can or cannot do something.
