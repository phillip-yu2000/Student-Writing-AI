I think that students would not benefit from taking classes from home because students would not learn better, students would have to deal with intruptions with family at home and students would not understand the information over a computer.

One reason i think that students would not benefit from taking classes from home is because students would not learn as good and understand the information as well than they would at a school. Also in a classroom environment they would be able to interact and do fun things with other students to understand the information easily.

Second reason i think that students would not benefit from taking classes from home is because studnets would have to deal with intruptions with their family. Therefore at a school they wouldn't have to deal with any intruptions with screaming and yelling children while learning their infromation.

Third reason i think that students would not benefit from taking classes from home is because studnets would not understand the information well over a computer through a screen. I think that students would understand better with a teacher in person instead through a screen.

Some may say that studnets would not benfit from attending classes from home while some may say students would benefit from taking classes from home. In conclusion i believe that students woud not benefit from attending classes from home because it would cause constant disruptions from stay at home family and the student wouldnt understand with lots of disruptions constantly.
