Dear principal,

I think it is very unfair that you are doing this. It is unfair to all of the students here because some of them are trying as hard as they can the keep their grades up and still do what they like. Student should be allowed to play a sport if they want because it is their life if they want to do sports more and school work less then let them do it. This is also unfair to parents because they have to pay for sports and school and their kids should be allowed to do what they want. If students are getting a c average they should be able to still play sports and make sure their school work comes before everything else. The teachers should give the students another chance and try to help them more. Maybe the teachers could have the students come in for extra help or get them a touter after sports to help them and try to get their grades higher. Students are always excited to do things with their friends after school. Are you really going to take that away from them. If the students don't get to do things like that they might turn to other things and end up failing school and dropping out. I know a principle doesn't want their students doing that so i think you should really think more about this before you go and make this decision.

Please think this over.

A student.
