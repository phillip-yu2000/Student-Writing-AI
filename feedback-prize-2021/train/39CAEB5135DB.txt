Venus is possibly the closest to Earth in size and density then and other planet. Which, makes you belive that just maybe, us humans can live on Venus just as we do live on Earth. Even tho Venus is very similar to our Earth it is very different. For example, Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. Even the surface is affected and can average 800 degrees Farenheit. Even though these conditons are too extreme for our human kind. We can possibly create something or discover something greater that can withstand all of those extreme enviorments.

Earth has an abundant of shapes and sizes of clouds. Not only do we have clouds that not only look beautiful, we also tend to have clouds that can harm us. Between a mixture of fog and rain it creates smog,which, can harm our skin. Not only does Earth have clouds, Venus does too. But Venus has clouds that can potentially kill all of human kind or melt through many types of metal. Venus has these very high corrosive sulfuric acid clouds in the atmosphere that would be a big problem for us humans to explore Venus.

In conclusion, all of these conditions on Venus doesnt have to be as problem as long as we can create or discover something to counteract the conditions. The author believes there is a way for us humans to finally study Venus and possibly make it capable for us humans to live. Earth changed through time and so have humans. Our technology has greatly increased from when we first started to live on earth. If we try hard enough to fulfil a great cause that will benefit us in the future we can possibly start something new.
