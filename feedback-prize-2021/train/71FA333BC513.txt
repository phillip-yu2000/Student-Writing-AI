i think having cars that can drive themself is a very bad idea. i dont think battery powered cars are a good idea. if we have cars that drive themself what happens when they break and people wont know how to fix it becuase they will think that it wont break. and poeple wont be as alert as they are today. becuase the car does all the work for them until the human has to take over. and say if the vehicle gets into a wreck whos responsible. bacuase if the human isnt driving how can they know whos fault it is. there are many roadblocks we have to break through before we even start to test these in real life situations. i feel like humans should be driving her eown car becuase if some one pulls right ou in front of them they will be alert and move out of the way of that other vehicle. and they claim that these driverless cars are more fual efficent but if every one drove a deisel car or truck that will be just as fuel efficent becuase a deisel burns hotter so it burns off alot more of those harmful chemicals. and a deisel creats more power. i personally dont have one i have a old truck that does horrible on gas but i will back up might statement. i preffer deisel i always have now i will admit yes eventually we will have to resort to elctric cars but we dont need driverless cars. theres no point we went all this time without them so why switch when we are doing fine without them. its almost like buying a brand new truck right off the lot then a year later when the new one comes out you uy that one. its pointless. so instead of wasting money one these dreams spend that money toward something that matters more.
