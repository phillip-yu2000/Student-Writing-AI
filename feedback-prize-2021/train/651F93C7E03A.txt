People think the face on Mars was created or a sign by the aliens. Well Im here to prove them that it was a natural landform. It couldn't have been created by aliens because NASA would have picked something up.

My first reason why the face was just a natural landform, is because in the text it states that '' The sensation was short lived. Scientists figuered it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia.'' Meaning that the face was just a natural landform created because they are common in that area.

My second reason why the face was just a natural landform, is because in the text it states that ''the team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.'' Meaning the face was just a natural landform and it had no connetion to aliens.

My third and final reason why the face was just a natural landform, is becuase in the text it states that '' What the picture actually shows it the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," says Garvin. Meaning that the face on Mars looks like landforms here on Earth.

In conclusion, the face was just a natural landform. The face was not made by aliens, it was just a natural landform, which are common in Cydonnia where the face appeared.
