i would want the electoral vote to be changed or to change the election by popular vote. Because the electoral college does have some things in it that are procieved as wrong and people want to change about it. And honestly i think i would be alot better if it was just the popular vote because then mre people would be satisfied with who their president is. Knowing that its someone they voted for ad not someone in which the electoral college votes for and decides to make the president. some presidents win the popular vote but still lose the presidency because they didnt get enough electoral votes. I would prefer a direct vote from popular votes.

I dont think it is that much fair if someone wins the popular vote but still dosent get picked to be the president because of the electoral college. In the electoral college voters dont vote for the president they vote for the state electors and thats not want they should be voting for they should be able to directly vote for the president that they want.
