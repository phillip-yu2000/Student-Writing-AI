Dear Principal,

Students use phones in various ways: either to talk to their friends, for calculators, but also for emergencies. I do believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school.

I don't think they should have the freedom to text anytime of the day.

I think if you would limit them on texting and stress the rule of no texting in class then Policy 1 would work fine.

I would make sure that when the students walk into class after lunch or one of the free periods that their phones were turned off.

It wouldn't take much time to check this, but it would make sure that the policy was working.

If you made a rule about NO phones at all, I think a lot of parents would be a little aggravated.

A lot of things could happen in a day of school: fights, a change in plans at the last minute, or even a family member in need and that student needs to know.

If you limited the rules to where no phones were allowed a lot of things could happen and if it is an emergency that person has a less likely chance of getting help when they need it.

During the free periods, if the student does have their phones out texting, I would suggest that they keep their phones on vibrate or silent.

This would be very courteous to the person next to them studying for a test or reading just for fun.

I think Policy 1 is the right choice for the school, as long as the rules are stressed and the other students don't disturb another peer by doing it.
