Dear principal,

As you may know not many of us students like the idea of you wanting to change the schools policy were we can not play any sports unless we work harder to have at least a B average. I like your idea a lot and think its great that you want to do that. The reason why is because it will be a good way to get the students to want to do better in school. Most kids just play around and think that school is a joke when truly its not. The kids that really like to play the sports should want to try and get the good grades to play the sports. I truly think and believe in that. It is just that easy to keep the sport if you just do your best to keep in it. I would love for you to do the best you can to make that change. It will make our school a better environment. What would i do without the coolest principal here at this school. The students need to realize how important this opportunity is. They should learn to appreciate the fact that you are trying to do something good for our school. These students here don't understand how important it is. I just wish that the students will start agreeing with the change and start making better grades to make their parents happier. If they think about it, it will be better if we achieve that goal. Its really not that hard to do so.

I achieved my goals by making myself move forward and participate in the game. Like they say on "High School Musical."

"You have to think right and break left keep your head on with what we do to day cause help is on the way." That capture helped me to remember that without my team I would not have made it , and won that game. I love your wonderful ideas and hope you think of some more great ones.

sincerely yours,
