Policy two should be informed because students should not be aloud to have their phones at school. Phones are a detraction to the school environment. When students are at school they are suppose to be focused on their school work and learning ,and not on talking or texting their friends.

If students have their phones they are more likely to text their friends on a test or quiz asking for answers and disobey the school rules. Phones should only be allowed to be use at school when an emergency occurs like a fire, but if the student needs to call a parent for a reason that's not an emergency ;the student should just ask permission to call from the office phone. Phones are a big distraction to a learning environment and it will hinder the student if allowed to be used in a school. Policy two should mainly be enforced in elementry,middle,and high schools. When and if students are allowed to have their phones during their free time they will be taking on their phones when they should be studying and focusing on their next test or quiz. If they r talking and using up all their free time it will result in less studying witch causes low test grades and not so good report cards unless the student can apply himself.
