Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should make a mandatory 8 hours of community service for students because it is important for students to help out around their neighborhood it boosts self confidence and it helps student appear to be good caring people instead of horrible children that don't care about anyone but themselves. Also it makes your community more different, it wont look any old community it'll be a community where people care about one another and do things for others. They're many organizations like the red cross that help out other communities for doing good things. People like it when they see that students are helping out around the community it shows that they care about others. Also students enjoy talking so why not let them talk to others about their community and what is going on around them.

Many students like to help out but they don't do it a lot because they don't get rewarded for so give them something in return for their good deeds . Give them a free A for every five that they help out around the community. i STUDENT_NAME
