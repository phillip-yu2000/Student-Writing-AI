Have you ever wanted to trust a car with your life? I for sure have not. In the text, Google cofounder, Sergey Brin was quoted saying,"such cars would fundamentally change the world." I disagree, driverless cars are a terrible idea for many reasons. The economy would fall tremendously. Many of people's lives would be at risk, and it's unhuman.

The economy is my biggest worry when it comes to driverless cars. Many jobs would be lost because of this. Bus drivers, taxi drivers, and factory workers jobs would be at risk. If this were to happen many families would be left homeless and hungry.

Another reason is that this could be very dangerous. I don't know about you ,but I don't want to put my life in the hands of a couple of cameras and sensors. People need to understand that commputers make mistakes and they are not perfect. The author even said," In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless.'' This means that the driver would have to remain focused and pay attention the entire time. I think this would cause some major problems.

The driver would be texting or even sleeping at the wheel. That is definiatly not safe!

My final reason is that the driverless car is unhuman. The human race has become very lazy over the last several hundred years. Yes, we have made life much more safe and efficient ,but driverless cars is going too far. Computers and robots are already taking our people's jobs in the factories, do we really want the to take hold of our cars?

To conclude, I don't agree with this article. I believe that driverless cars would cause many problems around the world. The economy would suffer, our safety would be at risk, and the idea of driverless cars is unhuman.
