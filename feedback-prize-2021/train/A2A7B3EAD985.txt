I am against the development of driverless cars. I am against them because they are not safe, they take away our abilities, and they are expensive. Everyone thinks theses cars are cool and will be better for everyone, but they are not better. They will destroy humainity.

One reason I am against the development of driverless cars is because theyare not safe. The cars can not be reliable at all times and the driver must always be alert. I think the car should be relibale and not need the driver to be alert. The driver could be waiting for a long time before it must take over, or it could all of a suden have a disfunction and need the driver to jump in right away. These cars are very hazardous and not sfae for anyone.

Another reason I am against the development of of driverless cars is because they take away are abilities. If we have driverless cars people will not drive. The cars will take over and we will forget how to drive and lose our abilities. Also, poeple will get more lazier because they do not have to drive, so they will not.

The last reason I am against the development of these cras is bacuse thay are expensive. Thses cars cost a lot to produce and take a lot of time. The cars must have sensors and cameras and many other functions to be known as eligible and those are very expensive items. Why waste money on these pointless cars, when we can just stick to the original amd safer cars with drivers.

Driverless cars are very dangerous and have much more work that needs to be done . I have many reason why I am against the development of driverles cars.

These cars are really expensive and the price will keep increasing, they also need a lot of work to become safer, and they are making people laizier and losing their abilities to drive. I think they should stop trying to make driverless cars into something that will never be safe or cheap enough ,and just make the originla cars we have now better advanced.
