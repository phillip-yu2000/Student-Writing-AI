Do you like traveling? Do you like helping people in need? Well if you said yes to these questions you might want to become a seagoing cowboy. There is a lot of hardwork,but you get to do a lot of fun things to. One of those is sight seeing.

Getting to see some of the places that you would get to see, are some places I was dreaming about seeing, before I became a seagoing cowboy. The seagoing cowboys made it a reality. One place you would get to see is Europe. In Europe you could see countries such as Greece, and I got to even see the Acropolis. I also got to take a gondola ride through the streets of Venice, Italy. Another thing I saw in Europe was a castle in Crete. Another country I got to sight see was China and in China I went passed the Panama canal. Even with all this fun we had the pleasure of helping people.

I knew I would have a good time and have many adventures,but not like what I had when I was a seagoing cowboy. One thing that I did was helped out with cattle. I got to see and take care of many animals during my time in Europe and China. One of my jobs was the night watch job. During my vist it also helped me understand that not everyone had the type of great life that we take for granted. It showed me that a lot of people have basic needs that they can't even fullfill, because of something that had happened to them.

As one can see my experience was fun! I not only got to help people in neeed, buy I created life lasting frienships.
