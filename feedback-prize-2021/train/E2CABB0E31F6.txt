Do you really think that there is alien life? The picture shown is land on Mars. NASA said that it was a shadow giving a "illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth." NASA studied the image to make sure they were correct of what they saw. People who believe in alien life base their statements upon opinions.

NASA even said it was "a natural land form. There was no alien monument." Something that big would have to be a piece of land. This was just a large mound on mars. The people who think it is a alien or a alien artifact think that NASA would hide this from the public while NASA says they wish there was a ancient alien civilation on Mars. What NASA is saying is that they would want people to see this and wish that it was a alien.

This image has nothing to do with alien life and just made a illusion of a face. NASA is not lying and double checked to make sure what they were seeing was certain. This is just land on mars and a picture taken at just the right angel and time to make that look like a alien. So now that I've told you the facts do you believe me?
