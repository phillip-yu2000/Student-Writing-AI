No way can that actually be made by aliens. The pictures don't lie, it is a natural mesa. We haven't even found life yet so how can we assume this is made by aliens.

The face is really just an illusion. It is just a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that, ironically, make it look like a face. We only released it to the public to get an attraction to Mars. The program didn't mean for all these conspiracies. All we wanted was some publicity for mars.

We even took another, better picture to prove it. I know not all people believe us that it isn't an alien monument. If you look at the picture though, it is clearly a natural landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the original. Still you doubt are findings about the landform.

Again, I think whole-heartedly that it is natural. You can believe what you think it is. We don't even know of life on Mars, how can aliens make it if none are even there. You can be a fool and think that it is a alien monument, but the pictures show it. It is nothing but a perfectly natural monument on the possibly populated Mars.

You may never believe me unless you go there and see it yourself. Personally it easily shows to be a natural landform. Many believe to this day that aliens made that structure and that it is impossible to have a natural sturctue of that likeness. Then again many more believe that it is perfectly natural and just an illusion.
