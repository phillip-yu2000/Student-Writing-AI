Yes, I do think it's a good idea for computers to read students emotions. I think it's a good idea because some students might have suicidal thoughts or might be suffering from abuse. It's always good to know what students are going through when they are sad. Alot of students dosen't like to show emotions or tell anyone about it. This Facial Action Coding system can prevent suicide.

Everyone will not think this program is safe, and is envading privacy.

But, this system can save suicidal people from all over the world. Prof. Thomas, Prof. Nicu, and Prof. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Emotions can be solved like math equations with this program.

This program should be put in all computers over the world to help you with school work also. This new technology can also help you with your work like a teacher. If the computer reads that you are stressed then it could explain the question to you better or help you. This new technology program can change the world.

I beleive that this program will spread on others and used by millions if this new technology is approved. This can be big help with teachers also. It could help them releive stress and give them advice or take a day off because of stress levels. It could improve humans and make them stress free.

My incoclusion is that this program can help everyone with their problems and stressful moments. I think it's a good idea to read emotions and can prevent suicide. There is not a doubt in my mind that will make me change my final answer. Your face dosen't lie and this program will be able to tell it like a polygraph.
