I am in favor of chaging to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Your vote would contribute to a president even greater than an Electoral Vote. Also, it provides a "voice" for a citizen.

In an election by popular vote my vote would make a difference because it is considered its own vote. When you in an Electoral College your vote is only a contribution. In Source 2:

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong it says, "each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters." This is one way to make you vote worth less than full vote.

Some believe that their vote won't make a differnece. The reality is that their vote wouldn't potentially assist their candidate towards winning the election as much as your own standing vote. In Source 3:

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President it is said, "Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote ...." And in a popular vote it provides you your "voice".

In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced with election by popular vote. The Electoral College makes your vote less of a vote. In an election by popular vote your vote would mean more. And you will be able to have your "voice" to say that you voted for the candidate you wanted.
