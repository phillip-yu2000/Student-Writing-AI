We both were really upset but then I went and asked my sister how to fix the promblem she suggested I go talk to Generic_Name and make her a note of me applogizing. Then, I went to ask my mom what to do to help get Generic_Name to not be mad at me anymore, and she said I should get Generic_Name a new pack of gum and apologize. My Dad said "you should make it up to her by going outside to play with her." After some thinking I decided to use my Moms advise. So later that evening, my Mom went and picked out her favorite gum and gave it to me to give to Generic_Name. I gave the gum to Generic_Name and appolgized and she forgave me.
