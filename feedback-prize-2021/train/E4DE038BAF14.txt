Hi I am a scientist at NASA discussing the face on Mars with Jacob that thinks that the face was created by ailens. I will explain to Jacob that the face was not created by aliens beacuse us sientist figured that it was just another Martian mesa wich is commen around Cydonia but only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like it had a face. Our caption noted a huge rock formation wich made it look like a human face. Some authors reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars by saying that aliens had created that human face on Mars.

We sent out a Global Surveyor to see and take a picture of the ''face". It arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997 18 years after the Viking mission ended. It would get a photo as soon as It can get it. When Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Mihael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they took the photo thousands of web surfers were waiting to see the image. When they saw the image they saw that it was only a land form. There was no alien monument after all.

As you can see if there where objacts in this picture like a house or something else you would be able to see it on this picture. What the picture actually shows is a Martian butte or mesa that are landforms commen around the American west. It remids me of the Middel butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho.
