Driverless cars are a big question in today's world. Driverless cars have been worked on for many years now, but none have been perfected. Why is this? Because at some point, all the cars need the help of a human being. Driverless cars have not been perfected because a car does not have instints, as humans do. A car can not make a decision, as a human can do. Driverless cars can not be perfected because there has to be a human to do these things.

The advancment of driverless cars has been attempted many times. Companies have tried to make cars totally opperable without humans. An example of this would be by making the roads smarter by putting magnets in them for the cars to follow and be pulled by. Another would be making the cars smarter by putting in senors, vibrations and lights. The downfall to these attempts is that they cost more money than it was worth. A way to produce a reasonably priced driverless car, or road, has not been found.

Cars have advanced in many ways. They have sensors, video cameras, and so many other things, but cars are not humans. If driverless cars became something many people used, many laws have been put in place for driving, some would have to be altered, and others just made new all together. Companies trying to produce driverless cars even realize that the cars can not function without an alert human being in the car to take over. This being said, it destory's the main idea of a driverless car in the first place. Driverless cars would not benifit people with all the factors put together.
