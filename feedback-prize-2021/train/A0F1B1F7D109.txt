Dear principal,

I think that you should let students have there phones at lunch and free time as long as the phone is turned off in the classes. The reason for this is that they could use it only at lunch to talk to friends and to just see what has been happening or even to talk to there mom and dad. It might be a good idea because even if you make the policy no cell phones aloud in school they are going to bring them anyway and use them when the teacher isn't looking. I also think that cell phones could be useful in classes to, one reason for that is that the students could use the phones as a calculator or to look something up on the internet for a certain project where u have to use the internet but there is no more computers to use. The students could also use the cell phones to text the teacher an answer to a problem instead of wasting paper.

All i am saying is that you should give them a chance and if it don't work out you can go back to a no cell phone policy. These are my reasons that you should let the students use there cell phones in school. I hope you consider the policy I chose because it could be useful in so many ways but it could also be bad in many ways to . And if you do choose policy 1 that u wont regret it because the students might do better in school plus you wont have to keep taking phones away every day.

Sincerely,
