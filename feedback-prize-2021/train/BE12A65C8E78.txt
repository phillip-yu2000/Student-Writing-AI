Have you ever felt like your opinion dident matter? There is lots of contriversey over the popular topic of the Electoral College,and wheter its good or bad. The electoral college is not an actual college, in fact its not a place at all. The founding fathers wrote it in the constitution as a comprisie between the election by the people or by congress for president. Some of Americas most iconnic people even agredon abolishing the Electoral College,and i agree.

In the system of the Electoral College the voters are not truley voteing for the pesident,but for there states elctors. The state electors are the ones who then vote for president. The electors can be anyone who does not hold public office. In simple terms the Electoral College is not fair to voters. The reson behind this is the winner take all system that each state has in place. So the canidates dose not waste time in states they know they have no support or chance of winning the popular vote.

A dispute over the Electoral College's final decision is possible,for example it happened in 2000. However it is less likely than an arughment over the popular vote. This is because the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College undoubtably execeeds the share of the popular vote. With the Electoral College in place some people dont even see the point in voteing.

Overall the Electoral College does more harm than it does good. America is supposed to be about the people, and we are a democracey. We should be the ones picking our own President by popular vote. With the Electoral College in place we are takeing more power away from the people and giving it to the goverment. It may be written in the constitution but its a new generstion and its time for change.    Â
