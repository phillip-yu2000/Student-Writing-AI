The story talks about how computer can recognize emotions by on our face. Dr. Huang made a computer that recognize Mona Lisa's face that she is mostly happy. People can recognize emotions but not guarateed while computer is guarateed. In next paragraph I will put few edivence to support the claim.

"The process begins when then computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles." "For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet, Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code." ""A classroom compter could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts."

Therefore, compter can recognize people when they are happy or sad. Even people can hide their emotions from people but not computer. I think it will help us to make others feel better when they are sad and they won't admit that they are sad.
