Dear, senator I hereby to inform you that I'm in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the United Staes, the kind we have now. For many reasons we believe the Electoral College should be abolish due to the process of electing the next president. During the Electoral College voters tend to vote but, not vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn to elect the president. We believe that over 60 percent of voters would prefer an election the kind we have now, as I said before. As you know the Electoral College consist of 538 electors, making it a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the President. Californa, making it the state with the most electoral votes, is a state that could rise a candidates votes, and is considered by the following candidates that California could be an enormous help for the candidate. Many voters have many questions regarless to the Electoral Vote, for example; can voters control whom, their electors vote for? Nor who picks the electors in the 1st place?, These are a few questions that many voters have. I believe we should forment and focous more on the popular vote of those who are qualified citizens. The biggest disaster with the electoral college was when the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, therefore making state legislatures responsible for picking electors. During an electoral college vote, if the electoral vote ends in a tie, the election would be held in the House of Reprsentatives, whereas state delegations would vote on the president. Candidates don't get to spend time in the states they know, having a chance of not winning. As a result of that, in the 2000 campaign, approximately seventeen states didn't have the oppurtunity to see the candidates. On the other hand the electoral college avoids the problem of elections. Therefore i considerate the electoral collge vote unfair to voters.
