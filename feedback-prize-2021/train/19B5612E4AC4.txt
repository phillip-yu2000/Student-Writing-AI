Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think Policy 1 would be a better choice. My feeling this way is because students should have some freedom and be able to use there cell phones at the times stated. This would resolve the issue of them trying to sneak on there phone during class time, when there suppose to be learning. I would recommended that you chose this policy because then students will know that they wont get there phones taken by staff members. Also if there was an emergency then they would need to be able to use there phones during that free time. If students chose to waste the time stated to use there phones, and try to use them during class time then the teacher should take them. Also if you were to chose Policy 2 students would just disobey and act like they didn't know. So I say Policy 1 students should be allowed to use there cell phones at the given times stated.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
