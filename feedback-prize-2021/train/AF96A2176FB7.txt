Do you think students should have online classes at home? Do you think this will benefit the students inÂ their life? In this paper, I will argue that students should not get online classes.

Students should not get online classes at home, because some students have to work and they are too busy to take online classes. Some people do not go to school, but they take online classes. some students work at night and they do not have time to take online classes. Students should not take online classes, because schools are for learning and home is for students to have fun, relax, and do what you want to do. Students should not take online classes, because they need to enjoy their free time while they are not in school. I do not want to take online classes, because I work at night and I do not have time to use online classes. My friend takes online classes when he is at home, but online classes took some of his free time.

Some people say, that students should have online classes because they need to focus in school and that they should start planning what they want to do when they are grown up and out of school. They are wrong, because life is not just to focus on what you want to do when you finish school, is to enjoy it and do whatever they want to do in their life. Some people want the best for their kids, but life is one and they should enjoy it.

I think in the future some students will go to school and do online classes in their free time, so they can focus on what they want. Some students will go to school, but they will not do online classes because they want to have a good career, but they do not want an excellent life like the other students.
