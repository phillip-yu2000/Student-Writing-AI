Dear, whom this may concern

Many students think that it is an out rage that you will not let them play a sport if they do not have at least a B to play. I say that this is a fair thing to do because, if you do not have a B while not playing a sport, then how are you ever going to be able to do it when it is taking up even more of your time. Time and effort are two of the big reasons why kids who have a grade of a C or lower should not be able to play ANY sports.

When kids are not playing sports, they have all day to do their work. Some can not even do it then, let alone having even less time to do their work. If the kids are not putting enough time in their work now, what on earth will make them want to do it when they have their sport on their mind all day.

Another contributing factor is, the effort kids put into their work. Most kids do not want to do their work in school, even if they are or are not playing a specific sport. Let's face it, most children who go to school just want it to be over with. When kids who play sports, who have a bad grade, they will be thinking about the sport they are playing then they actually school work that they are doing.

The idea of NOT letting students play a sport when their grades are suffering, is a terrific idea. The kids will have more of a desire to do better in school so they can play their favorite sport. The time and effort most kids put in is not good enough. If you make this a rule than, you will see a significant change in the way your students do their work in school.

Sincerely,
