Phones and Driving

When we think of cell phones we think of a device that we can't live without. A cell phone is something so essential to our lives that when we use them we tune everything else out. We constantly stay on our cellphones to distract us from the problems that are happening in the real world. We use our phones everywhere we go but we never watch our surroundings. When driving it is important to know your surrounding but when you're distracted by messages and phone calls and social media it puts the passengers and your life at risk

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at four times greater risk of a crash. Despite a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hands-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary for emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Yes, people should enjoy their rights to talk, text, snap, and all the uses of their phones just not while they're in their car. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase.
