Driverless cars seem like a very neat thing to have but unsafe. We never know what could happen having one of these types of cars. Yes they sound like a really great idea. It can do all the work for you as it says in the article "they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves." Which is really awesome but what if something happens and all that ends in something bad.

What if the car starts to have a malfunction and loses control. Who knows who would also be responible for the inccedent, like the author says "who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?" The driver may have to pay for the damge if they were to be responsible for the problem and that wouldnt be any fun or cheap. Also in the article it asks if it would be boring waiting your turn? So true though wouldnt it be boring just sitting there waiting your turn to drive? Aslo what if drivers are to busy on their phones and a deer pops right out and the car doesn't stop on its own. To put the car together manufacturers had to put so many sensors on the driveless cars isnt that a little to much? Last but not least theses cars can't drive through situations like traffic issues or navigate through roadwork. I do not think these cars are worth it.

How I feel about driveless cars is a no go. I don't think they should be sold to anyone. These people just never know what could go wrong with them. Very great idea just probably should stay an idea. They would need so much done to them to ever truly be safe for the people. It would take them many years to get to where they went them to be. Like they say "Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020." That's aways away to be waiting for them to come out, by then they'll have hovercrafts.
