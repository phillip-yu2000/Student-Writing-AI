Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that policy one is a better for our school. Many kids often use there cell phones during class and other times during the day. I believe that this is a problem because it distracts students through out the day. Even though this is a problem students should still be aloud to a cell phones for safety reasons. If there was something to go wrong at school, you should be able to call a parent or guardian . If you consider this, there should be some rules set into play. The major rule would be to keep your cell phone in your book bag at all times in less there is an emergency.

You should also tell all the teachers that if they catch any student messing on a cell phone for no reason that the cell phone will be confiscated until a parent or guardian comes and gets it. I have thought hard over this policy and i hope you will to. I also hoping to will consider my opinion.

Thanks a lot , Your student
