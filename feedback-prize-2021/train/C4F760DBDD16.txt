Dear Principle,

I believe that only allowing students with a grade B average to play sports is wrong and unfair. This is because without sports, students will lose their hobbies and it can get in the way of sporting careers that they may want to follow. Students can also get scholarships for sports which can help a lot if they're not strong in other subjects.

Some students only like one thing. Sports. If they can't do the one thing they enjoy they may give up in school which will only lower their grades. Banning sports from the majority of the school might also lead the school to forfeit their games because they might not have enough players to play the game.

Another reason why this rule is unfair is because maybe a student is aiming to get a scholarship in college from their athleticism. This is because they want to go to college to get a good job but might have a hard time making it because they aren't doing so well in school. Therefore, students start sports to go to a good college.

To achieve a good sporting career, many students start on school sports teams and gradually get better and better at the sport they love. If students aren't allowed to play on the sports team just because they have an average grade in school they can't follow their career of choice and they might end up with a job that they do not enjoy.

As you can see, banning sports from the majority of the school can lead to students lowering their grades and the school forfeiting their games. This also takes away the rights of students. This rule should not be made because it is unfair to most of the students.
