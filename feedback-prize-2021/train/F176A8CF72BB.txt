In my opinion i don't think that is fair. i think C average is fine because a lot of people might want to do sports but what if they weren't very smart in the beginning? just because you don't have a A or B doesn't mean your not smart and that you shouldn't be able to do sports.

I am not a

A+ student and i don't always get As and Bs but i always try my hardest. I also like sports so that shouldn't stop me from playing. i am not saying it isn't important to do well in school, i am just saying that a C average shouldn't stop you from what you want to do. i would just not go below a C average because that just shows you don't try so if you don't try hard at school then why should you get to play sports.

But the thing is that if you cant play for the school because your grades then you can just get on a reck team or a team outside your school. what is the point of not being able to play for your school team if you can just get on a reck team?

The teachers or principle cant stop you from being on a reck team when your grade is low, the only thing they can do is help you get it back up.

i guess i am both ways with this. But i just think a C average is good enough to play sports. the thing is that if you don't have a C average or higher and you cant play sports for your school then you can just get on a reck team. A reck team and the school team is pretty much the same thing. But i just don't like the fact that if you are failing school and say you want to play football really bad but you cant play on the school team then you can just play on the reck. so in my opinion there is just no point to having that rule when you can get on the reck team because when you sign up for the reck team they don't look at you grades.
