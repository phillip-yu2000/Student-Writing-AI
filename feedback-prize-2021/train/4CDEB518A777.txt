Dear Principal,

I would like to inform you about the works and outcomes of community service.

Many kids in schools across the country perform a task to help others out. I believe that this is the right and just thing to do. Everyone is a part of a community and they should do their part to help in any way possible.

There is a familiar saying, "Charity begins at home." Yes, this is true, but you can take that charity to other places in your environment. Community can make a person, but people also make a community. Human beings shape the way of life for all people and creatures. People need to help out in order to keep a society friendly,

civil, and fair.

Everyone needs a base to start off from. Many start from home, but others don't.

This is why school is a place to begin. Besides getting an education and being social, a school is an example of a hard working atmosphere. Kids help teachers,

teachers help kids, parents help the school, and so on. This builds a person's character. TEACHER_NAME, you are the head of SCHOOL_NAME, and you have the job of making this school a great place. I think that the kids of SCHOOL_NAME should help you and your ways by taking part in community service. You have the power to enforce a rule that states every child must help in community service at least weekly. I already tutor and babysit some students of SCHOOL_NAME, and I help clean up my neighborhood. If I can do that, think of how many people could! Then we would have a healthier and cleaner community.

People look up to you. Please help others take part in community service. It will be for the better. SCHOOL_NAME is a caring school that would make its community shine. Let's start helping out! Getting involved is the first step to building a safer and stronger community.

Thank you,

STUDENT_NAME
