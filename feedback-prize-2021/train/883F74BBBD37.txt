I believe that the cars are safe to an extent. These driveless cars would prevent crashes. But they are not complety drivless they still need human help. Whats to say the car is driving itself and when it switches to manul and the drivers not paying attention, or if the sytem is not working right and it does not alert the driver to turn or break. There are a lot of things that can go wrong. But on the other hand there is a lot that can go right. The sensors in the cars could allow the car to break long before the driver can react. These sensors can stop drivers from backing into things. the gps and 3D mapping could allow drivers to avoid crashes and avoid contrustion on roads. This would save drivers a lot of time. In closing I do believe that these cars are safe but to an ectend because they can not fully drive themselves.
