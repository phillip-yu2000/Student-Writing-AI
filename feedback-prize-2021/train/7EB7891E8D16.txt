Dear Principal,

I think that you should allow cell phones during lunch period because it's not class technically. I also think you should let us have cell phones during lunch period because it's a way the students can communicate. They could also talk to their mom or dad to make sure that they have a ride home safely.

I also think that if you take the cell phones away all together the students will be very mad. I think that the kids would try to sneak their cell phones in the school and that could cause a lot of problems, and the students would be in more trouble and you would have troubles dealing with it. I'm sure you wouldn't want to deal with that anyways.

So I hope I helped you make up your mind, and told you what could happen if you take the cell phones away all together.

And I'm sure you would like to see us get home safely. That is why we should have cell phones in the school and be able to use them at lunch.

Your student,
