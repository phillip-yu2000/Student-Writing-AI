Dear Mr. Senator,

Our foundig fathers established the Electoral College in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn to elect the president. The Electoral College regarded as people that seem to belong to the past and not in the present. The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning.

I believe that if anyone should have a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters, they have yet to make it in this world.

The most worrying is the result of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. We as Americans have the right to vote and yet the Electoral College still has its defenders. Voters expect another close election, in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. A larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign that a small state does. Just because most other things are equal they favor larger states. The Electoral College's method of selecting the president turns off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.

60% of Americans agree that the Electoral College should be abolished. The Electoral college is unfair, outdated, cruel, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right when he said "Abolish the Electoral College."

Sincerely,

John Smith
