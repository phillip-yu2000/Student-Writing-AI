When i heard about driverless cars i was shocked that they really were coming up with such a thing , yeah its cool but at the same time it is extremely dangerous.

As you can see the automobiles are still having to alert the drivers ! How can it be a driverless car an still need assistance to get out of certain situations? I feel they shouldn't be realesed on the car lots, they can put many adults and children at risk.

The pasage states ''wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive." The main concern is would the driver actually be alerted by the methods they have,when it's their turn to take control of the automobile. Also in the passage it states the car will look for any road trouble but will the car or driver be prepared for any kids darting across streets or any citizens on bikes .

I believe thats another reason why this car should not be realesed is because in the passage it says ''and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.'',''Presently traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times." There are to many flaws in these Driverless cars for them to get on the main roads just yet.

I feel if the public is concered about the safety of themselfes an their loved ones they would want to really postpone this driverless car situation, because a accident can occur in just a blink of an eye, you would basically be putting your life in danger by trusting technology that still has many problems and flaws .

This is why I believe that these Driverless cars should not be realeased .
