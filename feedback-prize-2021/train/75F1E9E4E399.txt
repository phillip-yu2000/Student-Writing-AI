I do believe that it would be a great idea to have the younger generation help out with the community. To help with building a sense of knowledge about helping out with the world we live in because, most kids these days don't really see how much others do just to make this earth a better place for them. Apparently my opinion will not be the same as most being that I am only one voice but with the addition of more I hope that I can spread the word of a better tomorrow so that we can help each generation become some thing more than just vegetables sitting in front of televisions wasting away.

For example it doesn't have to be the most drastic thing it can be as simple as walking the neighbor hood dogs or spending time with elders helping them with any thing they need or cleaning up around houses or streets. The most simplest things can help our society. There is still good in the world but we just got to get out there and find it and that is why community service should be required.
