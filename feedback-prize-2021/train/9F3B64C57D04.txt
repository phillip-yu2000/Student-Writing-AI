In order to detect human emotions these students are saying thrie computer can do it. I dont believe this and i'll tell you why.

Computers can tell you how u fell on the outside but can't tell you about the inside. Emotions are not based on facial expressions. I can smile through pain but the computer won't tell you that. Many people cause decive you with there emotions. The person who created this only uses six basic emotions that can decive you on the outside.

Explaining human emotions are very difficult because you cant actually tell how they feel on the inside. The emotions the show on the outside could decive how you see things. You should take the time to ask the person how they really feel after you get the results to see how accurate the computer really is. This computer cause not actually help these researchers.

Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional coomunication. With this being said i do not believe any computer in the 21st century is advanced enough to read true human emotion. Maybe one day somebody will invent the greatest computer ever. But as of right now emotion truly can't be read unless the person themselves actually tells you.
