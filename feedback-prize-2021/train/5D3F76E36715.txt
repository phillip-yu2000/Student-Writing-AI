The reason Luke joined the Seagoing Cowboys was so he could help rebuild people's home so they wpouldnt have to move to different countries. The purpose of the Seagoing Cowboys was to bring livestock and food for the livestock so they could live and eat so they wouldn't to stay without shelter.

food so they brought and the reason luke knew how to do all that hard work was because he helped out a bunch on his aunt's farm with cattle and horses and on Lukes second trip he was a watchman at night so no one would steal i would think.

Then later on that night he ended up breaking some ribs because he crashed into the metal strip on the side of the ship so he wouldnt fall in the ocean. Whenever he got free time with the other cowboys the played baseball and volleyball then they'd go back to work . and then he figured out what being a Seagoing Cowboy mean't to secure people's needs and and helps citizens.
