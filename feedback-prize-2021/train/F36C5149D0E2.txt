Dear Principle,

I believe that student can and should have cell phones at school. I agree that they should be turned off during class but at lunch and any other free time they can have their phones out. The reason I believe this is because if the phone doesn't disrupt learning I don't see one reason why students should not be able to have their phones out. Students don't always use their phones to catch up with their friends.

Students sometimes use their phone for school related things like... If a student wants to stay after for a math tutoring session they call their parents and ask if they can. Or if a student isn't sure if they are getting pick up from school or taking the bus home they use their phone. Also if they don't have lunch money in their account to buy lunch they can call their parents to let them know. Another why a student may use their phone is because maybe they forgot homework at home and their parent is home to drop it off at the school.

There are so many more reasons why students may need their phones.

I feel if the phones don't interrupt class time the phones should be allowed. But a student breaks the rules then I think their should be no phones allowed. But if the phone is off during class I think it fine students have their phones out during lunch or free time.
