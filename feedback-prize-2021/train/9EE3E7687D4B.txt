Dear Principal,

i think that you should let them participate in sports if they have at least a B grade average because that's consider passing. Also it not fair to not let them play because a B is still passing and if they don't play then they did all of that hard work for nothing. I also think that if they have a grade point C then some are consider passing like if they have a C+ that's passing.

Also if you don't let them play when they have a B average some students will actually give up on trying to pass because in there mind they think if you don't let them play then what's the point of passing.

Also i would like to point out that if some students that want to participate in sports but they have a grade C average then you should give them a chance to try to pull up they're grade and maybe that will motivate them on trying to pass in they're classes.

And if that doesn't work then maybe there not motivated enough or they just don't want to be in sports. Some students do take some time to get motivated maybe because they have problems or maybe because they are shy or think they to cool. Also you could put some kids in tutoring or programs to motivate them to pass they're classes so they could be in sports like for example football, basketball, track, volleyball, wrestling, or any sport they would like to do..
