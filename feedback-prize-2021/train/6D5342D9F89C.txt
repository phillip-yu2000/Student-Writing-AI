Dear TEACHER_NAME

principle of SCHOOL_NAME

I know that you are thinking about cell phones i think we should be able to use them while it is lunch, after school, or before school. We can use cell phones not just for texting calling, and games we can use them for our education.

Not everyone uses cell phones in class and i think it would be fair if they were able to bring their cell phones to school, and turn them off.

Students in class will like to use their cell phones for many things, but they know that they will be taken away for being used in class or in front of a teacher.

the only downside to me is moms will have to spend more money when it comes to the phone bill.

I f students use them in a bad to often then the privilege should be taken away from them.

On the other hand some people do use their cellular phones for bad things like texting, and internet so that could be the reason you wouldn't allow cell phones.

even though we use cell phones every day at school should not be the place for phones school is for learning. Not for texting on phones.

If cellular phones are used the school could get in trouble for letting students use them.

It would also ruin our reputation as a school so don't allow cellular phones.

in the end cell phones should not be used at school because kids would get distracted by them and not learn the things they need to .

cell phones do three bad things to the body first it rots your eyes. Then you get stuck texting forgetting proper spelling. Last it gets you in trouble for not having good grade in school.

Allowing cell phones at school is like allowing kids to bear arms they both will eventually ruin a kids life.

The kids in our school have more than enough time to use phones, and if you let them use it at school they will become more defiant, and disrespectful so TEACHER_NAME

don't allow Phones on campus.
