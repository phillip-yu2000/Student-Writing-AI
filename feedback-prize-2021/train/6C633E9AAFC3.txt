Have you wondered what could happen when using a cell phone while operating a vehicle? Using a cell phone while driving can lead to various disasters and should not be done at all. Not only are there various disasters but there are also various consequences.

To begin with if you're on your phone while driving it increases your risk of crashing and dying. It also puts the other people in the vehicle at risk and the people outside of the vehicle. It also can bring financial problems to the people involved if a wreck occurs.

There are only a few occasions where phone use while driving should be tolerable. If there is an emergency where you must contact the police, then yes you should use your phone. Or if there is a family emergency then yes you should use your phone. If it isn't one of those occasions, then you should not use your phone in a vehicle at all.

Lastly allot of people listen to music through their phone while driving. Changing your song should not be an excuse. This is because it still takes away your attention from the road to pick the song you want. Before you start driving you should pick a song and just let the rest shuffle and put your phone down. If caught on your phone while driving, you should be fined depending on the setting you are in.

This will conclude this passage on driving and using your phone. Remember that there are allot of consequences to it and re-think about doing it. I encourage you to learn more about this topic and I encourage you to tell your pears about the consequences that could happen so that there will be less people using phones while driving.
