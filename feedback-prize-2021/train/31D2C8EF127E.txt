Why Students With A C Average Shouldn't Be Playing Sports

I strongly agree with the idea that students should not be playing sports with an C average.

I know a C is passing but sports will drop our scores cause we are focusing more on sports than we are on raising our scores and that will only bring our scores down, and we wouldn't want that.

It doesn't matter if we are the best in the sport, we need to be the best in class also.

That's why our coaches and teachers should work harder in getting our students here at SCHOOL_NAME better grades that will and I hope this will let people recognize us a more intelligent school.

Our school has many intelligent students, but they just don't show it.

We have students talking back to the teacher, fighting, disobeying the school policies, and many other bad things to make our school look, and most of them students play sports.

These sport players are having problems with their grades and are doing things that they shouldn't be doing in class that's why most of them have an C average, and that's why you will see a most of our students in ISS (in school suspension), constantly in the main office, and in trouble all the time.

So I think its a good idea to consider students with a C average shouldn't play sports.

It is a good idea and it may help us improve our school in test scores. the policy should make this idea official soon I hope.

I would like to see what our school turns out to be if they do.
