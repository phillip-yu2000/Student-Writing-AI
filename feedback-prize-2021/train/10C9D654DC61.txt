'' The Face on Mars '' is just an natural landform because when we first got the image there were shadows around the face on the image. Which resembles just bumpy and holy its just an natural landform. Then, that's when we made the picture sharper that it was before so the people can really tell what it is.

That's when the next day the NASA posted the picture on their web site page called the JPL ,just to reveal that the face was not an alien artifact that it was an natural landform. Thats when they got some people who were mad that it wasn't an alien artifact. Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Like in paragraph 9, some mission controllers prepared to look again. Thats when I was like ''no'' theres no reason to send out another spacecraft just to say that its just and natural landform.

In conclusion, "It's not easy to target." "In fact its hard work." We just dont see faces very often. Thats when the picture of the landform got many comments like the ''were just not satsified that the image is just an natural landform." Its just that some people just want to make money from making up any thing like saying its an alien artifact. Some people just needs the wait and see if its really real or its just an natural thing that happens.
