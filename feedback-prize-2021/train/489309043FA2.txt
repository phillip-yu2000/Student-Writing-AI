Online School would benifit students in many ways: less bullying, less stress, better food, and teen suicide percentages would decrease.

Many students are bullied because of the way they look, how they dress, or how they act. Online School would eliminate all of those reasons for bullying. Students wouldn't have to worry about how they look or dress, furthermore, how they look, because no one can see them due to they fact that they don't have to leave the house. This would take a lot of stres and weight off of students' shoulders.

The stress of school and the judgment of other students, plays a big role in the cause of teen suicides. A student may take their own life, because of being bullied, or even school puttung to much weight and stress on their shoulders. Although Online School may not take away the strees of school, because we still gotta do a lot of work, it would take away the thought of being bullied: which would decrease stress and the percentage of teen suicides.

Some parents or students may disagree with the thought of Online school, because some would say "Kids need to be social" or "They need to get out more", but being social and going out isn't always a good thing. Some students are anti-social, and fear the thought of social interaction; Making Online School perfect for them; and not leaving the house could benifit in students getting to eat whatever they want, and who doesn't want that? I know I would.

Online School would benifit students in a variety of ways such as, better food, less stress, less bullying, and teen suicide percentages dropping. If I hade the chance to switch to Online School, I would definitly take that oppertunity.Â
