Dear Principal,

I think considering a new cell phone policy is a good idea. But i think policy 1 is much better (allowing students to bring cell phones and use them during free times as long as the phones are turned off during class). Lots of students use their phones in case of an emergency.

What if a student needed to be picked up for an emergency and didn't have enough time to look for a school phone? Not allowing cell phones will mean the students will have to waste their free time looking for a school phone.

Also, what if the student was a new student in a school and was lost but only had one person he/she knew? If cell phones are allowed then that student could ask that friend by text message where his/her next class is located.

I think cell phones should be allowed for various reasons during free time, but having them turned off during class. Thanks for reading this letter and consider to put policy 1 as the new cell phone rule.

Sincerely,
