"Driverless Cars Are Coming" is an article about the positives and negatives of driverless cars. It was a very interesting topic, one of the best i've read on an Istep test. It was about how we could be seeing drverless cars in the near future. It talked about how they've tested out many options from magnets to electrical rods. The article gave facts and didn't shy from what the issues were. Now I'm going to express my opinon on the topic.

My view on driverless cars is not a set voice. I agree with their concepts and the test ran but i don't agree with how fast they're trying to market it. It's only been sixteen years since we've gotten computers and only about eight or nine since we got modern computers. The touchscreen phone is fairly new and they have these "Hoverboards" which are just segways without handles. I guess what I'm trying to say is there's no reason to jump to something so big if we don't understand what we have yet. I don't doubt we will have self driving cars i just doubt it'll be so soon.

I see self drving cars as something we should pursuit. I just don't think it should be a main part of our advances in technology. There's so many things we can be doing other then creating this. We should finish finding ourselves before we start building technology that doesn't need us. with all this "machine doing" stuff we'll just be sitting at home while the bots do everything. Thats no a world i want to live in. A world where everyone looks to machines to do their work.
