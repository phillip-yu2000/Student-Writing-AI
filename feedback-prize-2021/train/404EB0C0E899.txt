There are a few reasons why it's good to not drive your car. One, is that your car emits so many greenhouse gases. And greenhouse gases are baad for the enviroment. Two, is that it promotes the use of bicycles and/or public transportation. Three, you really don't need your car anyways. Those are the reasons why I say that it would be good to limit car usage.

My first reason why I say we should limit car use is because of the greenhouse gases we are releasing into the air. In article, "In German Suburd, Life Goes On Without Cars", paragraph 5, it says, "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United Sates.", which means that 50 percent of the greenhousse gases that we release comes from cars.

My second reason why we should limit car us is because if we use cars, we would use something else to get around like a bicycle. And if we use a bicycle we wouldn't be releasing any greenhouse gases."It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bycicle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor." stated in article, "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota". This is prety much encouraging us to use bicycles instead of cars.

My third and final reason why we should limit our car usage is because we really don't need cars. We only use our cars to get us from place to place, stated article, "The End of Car Culture", paragraph 40 which says "A car just a means of getting from A to B when BART deosn't work." And why use a car, when you can use public transportation instead.

Now that yo know my reasons for limiting car usage, maybe you can try doing it. Limiting our car usage will give us less air pollution and give us a reason to ride our bikes instead of driving our car.
