The United States of America has been running on the Electoral college for a large amount of time. According to the article the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprimse between election and President. Unfortunately, some American citizens think they vote directly for the president which is a false statement. The electoral college system is innacurate, unfair, and is horribly balanced and desgined.

Although the electoral college system is used in  every presidental election the system is unfair to voters. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer in the article "Because of the winner-take-all system in each state candiates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the "Swing States". American citizens in states such as Rhode island, and South carolina are not getting the 'good side of the stick. 'Voters in small states sometimes don't get to see a single campaign ad' says Bradford. The electoral college is treating American citizens in small areas  horribly.

Alot of times, citizens cannot control who there electors vote for. Not to mention the electors are also anonymous. According to source 2 voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Their would be alot more better results if the citizens could trust electors with there votes. This system is badly desgined.
