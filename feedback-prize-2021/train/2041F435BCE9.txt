The idea of Driverless cars in the future can be a very controversial topic. Many may say that it is too dangerous, but others argue that there are ways to ensure safety and that these cars are the future of technology. In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" the author presents both sides of the argument. After reading the article, I have come to conclusion that Driverless cars are a positive change in technology and can be used for the better.

Google has already invented the driverless car and has been making improvements for years. The car contains sensors on the wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted on the rear view mirror, a GPS reciever, and an intertial motion sensor. All of these things are used in the car to ensure you are provided with a safe ride. Because of Google and their invention of the Driverless car, in the future this could be the public transportation system. These care would use half the fuel that taxis use today and a driverless car offers far more flexibility than a bus. Paragraph 5 states, "Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own" This quote is showing that all the sensors and cameras that they have inserted into the car make it safe to ride in and make it so that the car is mimicking how it would drive with a person behind the wheel.

In conclusion, The google driverless car is an invention that could change the future and they way that we get places. There are both positives and negatives found while testing these cars and making improvements. Overall, with all of the sensors put in the car to ensure safety, google can make it possible to have a safe ride in the car. Once all improvements have been made to the driverless car, it will change the future of transportation.
