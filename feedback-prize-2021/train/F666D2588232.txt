In my opinion, online school wouldn't be good for a kid. Kids in public or private school interact with kids all day everyday of the week so its normal for them to be social around other kids. Also, kids who do online classes at home, they have more of a chance to be awkard when around people since they don't see people besides the video conferencing.

Parents might think home schooled is better but for the most part, its only hurting the kids socail skills and they may not be fully understanding the stuff being taught. It's been proven that kids learn better around other kids and it espicually helps when they are actually seeing what they are being taught. Kids learn alot more together then alone, kids who go to public or private school, develop the knowledge to learn and start friendships, field trips, recess, and best of all, field day.

Another reason i think online classes aren't beneficial for students is because online classes require to much time staring at a computer screen and not enough interacting with real humans. All of this is more devestating to the brain then beneficial in my opinion. Kids just need other kids around to function sometimes, another person who can match their own energy 24/7. Students in home school just wont get the most exciting childhood in a sense.

In conclusion, kids who are in a public school or private school tend to be more social and more outgoing then kids in home school,they also tend to learn more as a group and just have a better time learning
