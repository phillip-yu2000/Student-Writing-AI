Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you're right on this the idea of this decision because if more kids spent they're time doing school work and planning ahead they're futures would probably be brighter and more obtainable. Not only would this motivate people to get their grades higher but it would also serve the experimental propose of seeing weather or not kids have to have a "prize" in order to increase their grades in school. I personally don't play much sports so this wouldn't effect me but I know of others who would be devastated by this new rule.

If this rule were to be in effect than I think many students would revolt at the idea especially in SCHOOL_NAME where most of the sport stars don't have the best marks. I think that this rule wouldn't really help anyone I mean people should want to get their grades up for themselves not because they want to play sports. I would have to disagree with this rule because it really favors no one and some people who get to play sports or do whatever they like in school enjoy school more and are motivated to excel.

If you really wanted to change things you should allow people to choose weather or not they want to take any physical activities. That would really allow students to dedicate their specific scholastic passions and generate better grades for themselves, their parents, and the school. In conclusion I think (and probably so do most of the other students) that not allowing students with a C average to try out or participate in sports is unfair and truly helps out no one and if enforced it would provide a negative unnecessary outcome for our school.
