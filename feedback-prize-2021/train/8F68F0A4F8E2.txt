The Face on Mars is a very talked about landform on Mars and it brings many conspiract theories with it. NASA stresses that it is a natural landform called a mesa while other beleive it was made by aliens.

NASA says it is a natural landform becuase it is in the Cydonia region of Mars which has many landform like the Face. They have also done extensive research on the Face and took many photos over the years. Their latest photo was in 2001. This photo was evidence that it had to be natural because each pixel shoed only 1.56 meters which meant that if there was any strage markings or buildings they would easily be seen. NASA also states the the Face on Mars is very similar to mesas on earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, says " It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...".

With the research NASA has done and with all the photo evidence it is easy to say that the Face on Mars is indeed a natural landform. Everything NASA has done to prove this eliminates any speculation or doubt brought up by the public. The Face on Mars is just another reason to appreciate the beauty of the universe and the hard work of NASA.
