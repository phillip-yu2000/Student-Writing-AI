The "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. Information from Nasa has led us to conclude that it was created by natural causes.

When the "Face on Mars" was first discovered, the picture seen was captioned, "huge rock formation." The discription then goes into detail about how shadows gave an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The public made up their own minds on how this Face had formed. The "Face on Mars" became a pop icon and was present in many films, books, and even radio stations.

The lack of evidence of life on Mars led people to also believe that NASA was withholding information regarding aliens or other life forms. These theories can not hold true because NASA would benifit greatly on finding life on Mars. NASA's profits would begin to increase.

Pictures were later taken to confirm that there is no alien monument on Mars. The picture actually showed a Martian equivalent of a butte or mess, landforms which are common on Earth.

Based on thorough evidence and research, NASA has come to conclude that the "Face on Mars" is nothing but a natural landform.
