Helping. I'm Luke,a Seagoing Cowboy. I hope to convince you to join helping people along the seas. Remember, this is an opportunity of a lifetime.

First off, let me tell some of the benefits. You get to meet new people,and if you don't like that, you can go sightseeing while your going to your destination. One of the best things are the fun. You can fence, play ping-pong, box, read, write, and even play baseball or volleyball! Somehow, this can all be done on a ship. This really helped pass time.

Next, let me tell you about work. This is not that bad concidering all the fun you can have. What you can do is check on the animals, clean the stalls, and feed/water them.

Most of all, the world can be opened up to you. It makes you more aware of people's needs. This can lead to a whole world of opportunity.

Helping people and animals can make people feel complete. This job was probably one of the best I've had. The experience taught me a valuable lesson. It makes me a better person and you could too!
