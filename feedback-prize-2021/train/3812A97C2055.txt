Dear state senator,

I believe that the Electoral College is quite sneaky. Some people have no idea that it even exists, let alone what it is, so why have it in the first place? People vote on the president because they like what they say that they are going to do for our country. For example (in line ten, the author says), under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." Basically, the people are not voting for the person they want, but for others to make the decison on who they think would be the better president

.

Sometimes the candidate for president is a favorited in the north, south, south west and so on, so that gives the candidate no incentive to campaign there. If there was not an Electoral College, then the candidate would have more of a chance to actually win people over instead of taking advantage of what reigon that they come from. For example, some people think that some candidates are anachronisms because their ideas are very outdated. With the Electoral College gone, the people who are "zoned," for lack of a better term, for that specific candidate, can freely choose who they think would be a better choice for president.

So, basically, I believe that the Electoral College is a terrible system because people do not even know what it is or that it exists and that favortism plays an emense part in a system that is "ruled by the people".

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
