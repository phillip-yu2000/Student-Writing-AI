Dear Principal,

I'm writing you this letter because

I think that the policy that you should use is the first policy because students should be able to use there cell phones during lunch periods and during free times. This allows students to contact their parents if they need anything or if they have an emergency. Some students think it seems easier if they're allowed to use there cell phones during lunch periods and during free times because maybe out of nowhere they need lunch money or they don't feel good they can just use there cell phones to call or text their parents because they already have there cell phones with them so they don't have to go to the office and use there phone when they can just use there's with them. I think that the first policy is the best policy, so you consider which policy seems right to you. Thank you for your time. (:

Sincerely,

-STUDENT_NAME. (:
