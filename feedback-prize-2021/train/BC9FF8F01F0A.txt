Senator, my name is PROPER_NAME. In my opinion i strongly think that we should not keep the Electroral College process. A process that elect the president by a vote in congress is  unfair to the people. I have my reason for thinking that way.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The people of the United States want to be able to vote for whomever they think is right to lead this country. If the people is going to have a leader, i think that they shoud be able to choose that leader themselves.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's condidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. The people do not even know who the electors really are. Ask yourself this, who picks the electors?.  We all know its not the people, its sometimes state conventions, sometimes the sate party's central, and sometimes the presidential condidates themselves. What we all asking is, can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.

Sometimes the voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Imagine how the people feel about this, The electoral college is just unfair, outdated, and irrational.

sincerly
