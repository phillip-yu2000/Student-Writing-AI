Dear principle.

I believe that we should go with policy 1 because. Students already use there cell phones anyway its a waste of time to try and stop them. There just going to do it anyway. The world is evolving daily everything is changing almost all of the students have a phone let them use it during lunch and free time.

And there is also a good use of the cell phones. Teachers can use it to send work to the students through text messages and the students can send there answers back. Also the students can help other students with there work by talking to them through texts. It will also be easier to remind students of up coming tests and remind them to study.

But there are some disadvantages to having cell phones in school. One is that students could lose our get there cell phones stolen and then the office would be blown up by angry parents .Two students would not watch wear they are going and could fall our run into someone and then the school could be sued. Three the students wouldn't get all of there nutrients from lunch because they would be texting all of there lunch period and then they would think about food instead of listening to the teacher.

And as i said earlier there are advantages and disadvantages to having cell phones in school. But we need to use them at the right time and not abuse the privilege of using them.
