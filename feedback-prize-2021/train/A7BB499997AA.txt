I say that the "Face" on Mars is just a natural landform because first of all aliens do not live, and second of all why would an alien create a human face.

I think that is an alien created this human "face," the alienwould have created a face of an alien because probably aliens have never seen a human before.

I do believe that at first you would probably think that an alien created this but after many scientists researching and exploring the "face" they clearly stated "this face reminds us most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plan of Idaho."

Just like Earth is a plant Mars is also a planet,, and just like Earth has natural landformation many other plants have natural landformation not just Earth.

In the articule it states "the rock formation even has eyes, nose, and a mouth," I personaly do not think that an alien could create something with such details.

Not just in Mars, scientists and explorers have found many natural landformation.

After all that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter studied they finally found out that the "face" was just a natural landformation.

All the scientists and people who believed it was an alien still wanted to research more beacuse they didn't believe that it was a landformation, this is based on what I have heard.

Again what this image acutually shows is the Martian of a butte or mesa landforms common around the Ameriacan West.

In the article it also states that the "Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as thye Face on Mars."
