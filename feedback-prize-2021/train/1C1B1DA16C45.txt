To the principal ,

i believe that you should allow students to bring there cell phones to school as long as they have it turn off during class because they do work all day and its like when they have free time that's our time to relax from all the work we do all day. I definitely agree with the fact that the phones should be turn off during class because they cause big distractions and even possibly be used as a cheating utensil ,so before any class begins the teacher should ask everybody to take out there phone and turn it off in front of them to make sure and by lunch time or any free time they have when the lessons are over what does it hurt for you to let them take out there phones its not doing any harm because its not during instructions .

So basically what I'm trying to say is that you should let the students take out there phones but you also never know if there's an emergency and they need to hurry and get help they would automatically have there phones with them but if you ban them from bringing there phones that's going to be a real big problem. What if there parents has something to tell them and its to that point were they can't call they school to tell them ,they can call there child, but that's my opinion on why i believe you should use policy 1 and you can also see how it goes if that strategy doesn't function very well then that's when you can move on to your second policy but you will never find out what will happen unless you try to see if the students can handle it .They need to know this a privilege that there getting to take out there phones but once again try it and see what the conclusion comes out to be, you might even be surprised.
