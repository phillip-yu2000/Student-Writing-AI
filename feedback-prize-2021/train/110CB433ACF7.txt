I agree wiith the principal when he say's all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and this is why I agree because it keeps the kids active I also awont' gree because it can be fun for the students exspcally if they have a friend or family member they like to see thats there and so they won't be lonely and it can also give you somethng to do after school it can aslo provide exercise for the students and keep the studethints healthy and if they get use to it they might carry on doing it and still try to do it in the future and this is another reason why I agree with the principal because the students won't be bored because it's boring if you have nothing to do after school or doing school hours and I also think it's a good idea because you can have stuff to talk about with your friends,family,peers,teachers,and others and other reasons why I agree is because some parents might won't there child or children staying active or being in a school activity beacuse they might wan't them to stay healthy and because might have to pick there child up at a certian time because of there job and there child will hityave have something to do after school while thier parent or parent's are at work so it keeps them occupied and so the parents won't be worried and I think another reason why it's a good idea is if they are playing sports like football,soccer,basketball,and others it will be good for them to play other schools and travel more reasons are when the the students grow up and ask them what was they childhood like they could say that they was active and healthy and always had something to do during school and after school with my friends because my principal said that we must do at least on extracurricular activityÂ
