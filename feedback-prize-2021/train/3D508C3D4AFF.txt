You use driving in everyday life such as the school bus, cars, trucks, etc... Today manufactors are smarter than ever and today the have driveless car! That is crazy isn´t it, now you still have to have your hand on the wheel but for the most part the drives for you.

I dont´t mind the idea of moving cars, I just wouldn´t buy one because I like to be able to control the car and not a computer. I just don´t think i would trust it. The price on these car are probaly going to be very high and if you wreck who are you going to blame it on, the car or yourself. Plus we would have to make new laws about the marst cars as well.

If there are these cars I beleive there will be more wrecks because of machanical failure in ther car, Those wrecks will lead to lawsuits of the people who had the car and is trying to the maufactors and the people have a good lawyer they will probaly which might put the car business in a strugle if the give up all this money from lawsuits.

If we have driverless car there will be more wrecks and mor lawsuit out and I don´t think it is worth all of that. So I think we should just stick to regular car and make them more safe.
