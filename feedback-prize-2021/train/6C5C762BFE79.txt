Driverless Cars would be great. But in all reality how safe are they? Are they going to be expensive? Should we trust these cars with our lives? There are a lot of questions that could be asked about these cars. But can they all be proven? Well people will soon come to find out.

How safe are these cars? They are safe until they have a technology mishap or faailure. You can not always trust technology. Any question of these cars could be asked. But what if they can't be proven? For instance if your car doesn't warn you of danger, road construction, or any detours and you're asleep. But your car didn't warn you. How's that your fault? That's the thing they will tell you that you were "driving" so it was your fault.

These cars may not be safe. They may not even be cheap. Do i think driverless cars are a good idea? No i think they are a terrible idea. I'm sure many people would agree. There are enough accidents as there is. But if a car is going to fail there's another. And it may not be your fault. But you were the one driving.
