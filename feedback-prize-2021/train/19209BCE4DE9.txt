Join the

Sea Going Cowboys Program!

I am Luke Bomberger, a seagoing cowboy. I am part of a big program known as the UNRRA who has hired seagoing cowboys. The UNRRA

allows us to help the countires who have been destroyed by war. I take care of the animals over sea and it is amazing to care for them and be known as a seagoing cowboy. Join me to help the others. Here are some reasons why you should become a seagoing cowboy.

First reason, this program is not for fun. It is for the people who are devastated right now in life. They just had to deal with with World War II. This war left many countries to pieces. The animals needed to be taken care of so that is where the seagoing cowboys come in. The seagoing cowboys care for the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Another reason, the seagoing cowboys are pleasured with free time to see beautiful sights and views. I got to see Europe,China,Italy and Greece. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece and take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. This is just a really nice way to enjoy myself while helping out the world in a good way as well. Lastly, we have fun on board with fellow seagoing cowboys. we will play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. This helps us pass time on board the sea.

Being a seagoingcowboy is dedication. It is hard work. It is fun and beautiful. Being a seagoing cowboy means you are helping the animals and the world in a wonderful way. You get to care for animals, see beautiful sights, play fun games, and help the people who just had to suffer from world War II.
