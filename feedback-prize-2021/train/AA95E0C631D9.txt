Dear Principal,

In my opinion i think that policy is unfair. Many students have a C average because they have practice and don't have time to study. If you were to put in the policy then you would probably lose half of the team or kids we try to study every hour there not at practice and get overwhelmed. Even some kids who don't play sports have a C so what makes you think kids on a team with less time to study can keep a B average.

I understand why you want to make that policy. You want your school to be recognized for having good grades but kids like to have fun. If you were to ask any kid about the policy even ones who don't play sports they would say wrong. Kids need exercise and to have fun if you put that policy then it would make a lot of kids mad and they would spend more time complaining then studying.

What I am trying to say is your only a kid once, so why spend your time stressing over playing sports and studying. so it would make the kids a lot happier if the school policy stays the same. If the kids drop below a C then they should not be able to play. So would you rather keep every thing the same or having kids complain for the next five months, its you choice.
