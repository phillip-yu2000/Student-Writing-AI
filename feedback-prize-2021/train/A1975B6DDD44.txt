My argument about Lukes point of view is that in paragraph four it show that Luke had made nine trips, so Luke tavels to a lot of different places. Luke had traveled to the eastern coast to get to China. Luke would want others to participate in Seagoing Cowboys program to teach what Luke does when he is a seagoing cowboy.

The article shows that Luke adventures lot sof things when he is a seagoing cowboy he ahd to take care of animals when he was a seagoing cowboy, such as a horse and a cow. Luke and his friend Don signed up to probably or most likely show that Luke was a good seagoing cowboy. Luke had crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times that had affected by World War two.

Details from the article that supports Lukes claims is Luke always helped other animals that had was showed in the passage. I think others would join Lukes program because he is a grateful person that shows that Luke is grateful in the passage. Luke had showed that Luke was a grateful person is, in the passage it says ''Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy''.

I think that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy because in the passage it shows that Luke loves being a seagoing cowboy. Luke showed that he wanted to help others and animals as he would want to start a program. Luke had toured an excavated castle in crete and maeveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. I think he liked China as the best tour that he probably been on before, because he talked a lot about China in the passage about where different parts in China that he had been to that had been stated in the passage. The conclusion is that Luke is a good seagoing cowboy that was showed in the passage. And he loves that he is doing in the passage i think, he likes caring for other animals that were in the passage that it was stated in the passage.
