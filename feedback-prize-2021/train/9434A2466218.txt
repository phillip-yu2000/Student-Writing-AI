Dear Principal:

I am really against the rule, you can't participate in any sports or other activities without a B average as your grade. I think that the reason all of the students have C' s is because they are not in any sports or other activities. It is a proven fact that if you put a student in a sport or other activities, they will do better in school. So i think you should lower the bar to a 75% grade average and when they start doing better in school, raise it back up to having a B average. Also if that doesn't work then maybe you can talk to the student and the parents to see what going on. But I am sure that if listen to what i am saying, my idea will work .

Many students struggle with school, so if you lower the average down so the students can do sports and other activities it can help them learn the stuff in school a different way for them to understand. But as soon as there grades go up and prove that they can keep them up then you can raise the grade average to a B. Also if you start out with a B average then many students might think that your saying there to dumb to do a sport or other activities. Next thing you know, there grades are dropping even lower. That is what I have to say about you trying to raise the grade average to early as B .

Sincerely,
