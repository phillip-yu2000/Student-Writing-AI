It is not a face. As you can tell in the picture, it clearly resembles a face, but there are a lot of facts to show that it is not. First, they have updated images showing it is a rock formation, just like here on Earth. Second, if it could prove aliens once lived, or currently live on Mars, then NASA would not hesitate to publish it. The Mars face is only a natural rock formation.

There are newer images proving it is a rock. With our growing technology we sent spacecrafts close to Cydonia, and they show rock formations. This rock formation is much like what we have on Earth. The shadows cast upon the rock, giving it facial features. On a different day, those shadows are not there.

Why would NASA keep this a secret? NASA would thrive from finding alien lifeforms. Why would they keep that private. As the story states, " Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." They want that, because their budget would increase and they could do better projects if they had published it.

Nerws articles claimed it was a rock formation long before any conspiracy theories were out. Soon, after the second shot of it, scientists proved it was just another rock formation that resembles many we have here on Earth today.

Even though the photos look like they have facial features, and could be the remains of an ancient alien civilization, it is not. Some facts to back it up are that NASA would not hide something this benefitual to them from the public, scientists have proven it was made naturally by rock, and better resolution photos prove that it is just a rock formation with shadows showing facial features. In Mars' revolution the sun does not always cast a shadow on it, and that is why the features do not always show up, proving that the Mars face is just another face in conspiracy history.
