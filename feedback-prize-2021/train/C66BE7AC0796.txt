Dear Principle, if students have to have at least a B average to play sports then all the people that are good at sports with a C will not be able to help out the school team. Some student may not even stay in school if they cant play sports it could be the only thing keeping them motivated to make good grades and stay in school. A lot of student make C' s and a C is still passing, if C is the best they can do and their trying then they should be able to stay on the school sports team. If you only allow students to play a sport with a B or higher then you might not even get enough students for a whole team and if you do they may not be to good at the sport. One student may be outstanding at a sport but if you don't let them play because they don't have a B they could possibly get angry and start fights and disrespect teachers and eventually get expelled. For some students that may love sports might not be able to make a B to save there life, eventually the school rates will go down and we could become the worst school in the state. Parents might start pulling there children out and transferring them, or home schooling just so they could play a sport with a D or a C not A or B. Sports to some students are the most important thing to them and then you just take it away from them because they don't have a B or higher, how do you think that makes them feel.
