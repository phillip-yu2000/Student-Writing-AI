Some students don't think that doing extracurricular things like sports, yearbook, or be on student council are fun or even interesting. Students shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. It should be their choice to do something that they like, instead of the principal's choice.

Students have so much homework now, that they do not have time to do extracurricular things. To some kids school is more important than sports and other things. They want to focus on their future as an adult, so they want to prioritize school and not the other things. Doing good in school gets you a good job. A good job, gets you good money.

Some parents can't afford to buy the thing that the kids need to do the extracurricular activity. What if a student wants to do a sport, but they can't because their parent can't afford to buy the gear that they need. Gear is very important, so when you play a sport that you want to play, you can play safely. What if the kid is doing an art class and they need paint brushes and crayons, but they can't afford to buy it. Plus they don't even want to take that class, they are only taking the class because their principal is forcing them too.

Student might not be interested in the extracurricular activities that the school offers. Why should kids be forced to do something that they don't want to do? It's wrong for someone to do that to a child. Kids are tired enough from waking up really early and then having to do something else in the day. Maybe they aren't committed to doing something because they aren't interested in it. What you do in school is depending on your career, why would you do something are you aren't interested or committed too?

These students shouldn't be forced to do something that they don't want too do. Either they are too busy, they can't afford to buy what is required to have in that class, or if they aren't interested in it. Students should be able to choose what they want too do, not the principle.Â
