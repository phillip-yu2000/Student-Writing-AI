Teens that go to school from home always say it is a lot easier. They say you can go at your own pace and resume your lesson at any time you'd like! so, I agree with this argument. I believe students can definitely learn better with online classes. Think about it; students would have less distractions, they would be in their own comfortable environment, a lot more time would be given on assignments; `and it would decrease the stress levels in a high school and/or college student. Allow me to provide more reasons on why taking online classes is a lot easier.

Students who take online classes have a significantly lower chance of developing depression due to public school bullying or online bullying. Students also tend to hold a higher GPA score due to self pace that online classes provide. While some parents believe online classes is a great idea for their teen, other parents think differently. Parents also believe that taking online classes could greatly jeopardize their teen's mental growth. They fear their teen could be 'socially awkward' or wouldn't develop the proper structure a kid develops in public school, which is: learning how to sign a check, learning that things must be done by a certain time, learning the law, etc... all of these thoughts are fears that parents think of when they think of putting their teen on online classes when in reality, online classes teach the exact same thing!

So, in conclusion, I believe students should have some online classes. It would make things a lot easier in high school and/or college student's schedules and lives. It would also help them mentally. Schools should take these online classes into consideration because it could also help with school grade scales, overall class grades, and test scores.
