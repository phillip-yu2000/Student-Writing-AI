Whenever I seek advice I would rather go to multiple opinions then one.

I need help in a xbox game or if i'm talking to a girl, I talk to Generic_Name. If I need help in school or i'm in trouble anywhere else I talk to my mom. Or if I need spiritual advice I used to talk to Generic_Name. I do that because my mom is not a boy and she wouldn't know what to say and Generic_Name isn't spiritual so he couldn't help me.

My mom once went to school once, and she admits she gotten in a lot of trouble also. So whenever I get in trouble, she tells me what I did wrong and right and how to fix it. Generic_Name is in my school with me so I really cant ask him because we go through the same thing. I dont talk to my Generic_Name anymore so he couldnt really give me his opinion on my behavior. Thats why mom is perfect to go for school advice.

Generic_Name is my best friend so we play a lot of games together. We also play a lot of games by our selves so we know a lot of things that the other doesnt know. So when I dont know something he can tell me how and why to do it. Also with girls because we both talk to girls and he knows so I dont know and I know some he doesnt know. Even though I know more we still talk about it.

I met Generic_Name on xbox over the summer. He was different then anybody I ever met. He was really into spirituality and he always told me to follow it. He always told he was truth about things that nobody ever wanted to speak on but he told me to me never believe him. He told me spirituality will teach me all the things he knows. So whenever I needed help meditating or anything he would teach me. He really changed my life with his opinion and advice.

In conclusion, they all helped me a lot. They all have different opinions and advice that make me who I am. Without different advice I would basiclly be a spitting imagine of them. Following all their advice and just believing it all. Thats why I thing people need to talk to more than one person for advice.
