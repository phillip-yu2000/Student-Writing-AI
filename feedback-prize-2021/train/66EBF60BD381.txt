Phones & Driving

One major impact on our society today is the usage of cell phones. So many people in the world today uses their cellular device on daily basis. Rather its usage is for an alarm clock, social media, or texting. People don't even like to have phone conversations anymore they just text that particular person they want to speak to their entire thoughts. Another major impact in today's society with these phones is driving and using them.

Typically teens from the age of 16 to the adult age of approximately 25 are affected by texting and driving. These people affected by texting and driving are mainly because people feel like once they phone rings they must immediately See who their being texted by, called by, or any notified from on social media. Most of the time that's can cause you to have an accident, which also may lead up to a death. Many little distractions are putting other drivers, pedestrians, and yourself at risk of being in serious dangerous accident.

In conclusion I say all this to say that be a safe driver, always pay attention to the road and stay off your phone.
