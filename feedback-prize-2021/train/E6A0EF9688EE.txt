I agree, students should participate in after school activities because it's a way to express yourself and to get know other people, there is a big chance that you could make many friends as well. First, I believe that if you participate in an after school activity it will make your mental health and physical health better. For example, football is a very active sport, you can get a lot of exercise out of playing the game, doing drills or even just going over the plays, It tests you in a physical and mental way. What if thats just not your thing, you could go for robotics, it will challenge how well you are with your hands by putting intricate things together or even coding the robots or the project your working on. Maybe you just want a relaxingÂ activity, there is a program called base, it helps students study by providing a nice, quit, and relaxing environment, you are allowed to talk to other people around you but the volume must stay low. Secondly, instead of all the activities, you are also allowed to stay after school with your teachers, make up some work, retake a quiz/test, or do some community service for them, there is a place for everyone at after school. Lastly, after school is open to anyone who wants to come, we will gladly welcome you with open arms, if you have any questions about where to go or even what teachers stay after school, you can ask the front desk, or your teachers for more information. The news will have announcements about after school if it will be an all academic day or if after school is canceled it will probably be announced on the news. I feel like everyone should go to after school so everyone can have the same oportonitys to ask teachers if they need help or what they need to do in class to catch up, or even show the gym teachers how good you are at sports, but always remember that after school should always be a safe and fun environment, and make it as enjoyable for other people as it is for you.
