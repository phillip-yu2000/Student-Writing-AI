Dear TEACHER_NAME

Our school activities are a important part of the school. Having a B average is sometimes hard to maintain. Often kids make mistakes on homework or tests and get a bad grade. Although they worked hard to bring there grade back up, it might be stuck at the C average level. Once a bad grade is in the grade book it hard to bring it back up. Especially if its is at the beginning or end of the term. Sometimes teachers give quizzes on our note and we may not have taken good notes. That one bad grade may take a grade from a B average to a C and it was just one grade. Students are far from perfect but we try to do the best that we can. We may work our butts off the entire semester and come out with a C because that all we can do, and that's alright but our privileges shouldn't be taken away because of that. A C is what an average person can do and that's what most of us are. Just average students trying to do the best that we can.

Boys are the most average when it comes to grades. They sometimes play in class and goof off, but the truth is they work so hard. When they are focused they don't even talk to the teacher. They maintain a C average, sometimes better, but that what they can do and because they try and do there very best they should get to play sports.

Girls also have faults here and there and they slip up also. But we work our fingers to the bone doing all we can to get a better grade. sometimes a C is the best we can do and that is alright also.

The main idea of school is to learn, on and off the court, the field, or whatever the student might play. The whole reason we come to school is to learn. That means also learning from our mistakes and doing everything we can to do better. The grade average for students shouldn't matter so much as did we learn.
