I do not think that policy should be ok. For some kids who are not doing so well or have a C average , sports is their only way to get stress out. They could be stressed out about school and they don't need anything more about school to be stressed out about.

When some kids are trying to do well in their sport they aren't going to do well in school if the average has to be a B. It should still be a C so they don't have to be even more stressed out.

Some parents might not be happy with this change either. Because their child might be just one point away from being a B average. And when their child try's to do good in school they might not be doing so well in their sport. That would mean that their coach would bench them , and that's really boring. Parents want their child to be the star of the team and that could contribute to the stress level. At home there's the parents who give thies kids chores that cuts about a half hour from homework time and then they have to go to practise. Normally practices don't get done till around 6 or 7 the kids still have to eat dinner and finish their homework and get to bed at a decent time. that's not possible for a 15 year-old.

And some kids just love sports and school. They love making their moms and dads happy with them. So they try to do both at the same time school and sports. They find a happy medium and stick with it. I bet there's only 4 kids at this school not even who could keep their grades at a good B+ , and their coach very happy with them. I just don't think that's possible.

All of my reasons are good reasons to keep the average at a C.
