Dear Principal,

It has come to my attention that you are deciding allowing cell phones in school or not accepting cell phones at all. The teenagers at your school will be more than happy if you do allow these phones. Cell phones should be accepted into your school during free times because no issues should occur, teens will like school more and in case of emergency.

Offering the young educators their cell phones in school should not be an issue. As long as the kids in the school do not use the phones in class there will be no harm done. If a young adult does exercise their phone during a class hour then the phone should be taken away for a week. this will cause kids to not want to use their phones in class. One of my friends has used their cell phones in class before. He was caught and was told not to use it again. After this he never applied his phone again. Kids should be allowed to have their cell phones in school.

Another reason to allow cell phones is teens would like your school and you as a principle. I have always wanted to go to a school where you had the decision to interact with your phone during pass times or during lunch periods. Many kids would want to go to this middle school. These cell phones should be allowed in school.

One last reason to allow phones is in case of an emergency. If someone is hurt but is alone in a class they should be allowed to call for help. 911 is an important number to dial in the case of any type of emergency. Schools will need to allow phones for many reasons one of them is to avoid harm.

Your school should allow cell phones because of no issues, kid will like your school and in case of an emergency. Thank you for taking the time to read my l
