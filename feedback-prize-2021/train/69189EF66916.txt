If you were in Europe on a cattle boat what would you do? First of all here's some things you would do or what you want to do.

Ok 1945, world war was over in Europe, and many countries were left in reins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA [ the United Nations relief and rehabilitation administractor].

UNRRA hired seagoing Cowboys to take care of the animals that were shied overseas. Those were the things you would've had to do.

The thing that you want to do is help people out you would have the opportunity to go to Europe and China. It would take about 2 weeks to cross Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. So caring for the animals is a nice and helpful thing that would keep you busy. Stalls had to be cleaned out every single day and you have to feed them. Helping out at a farm would prepare you for hard work. You would be very happy in Europe on a cattle boat exspeacally if you are a man. You would get little hurt but not for long. You would play a lot of games like boxing, playing volleyball, basketball and more. It would be a adventure if you are a seagoing cowboy.

Those are somethings you would have to do and what you would want to do.
