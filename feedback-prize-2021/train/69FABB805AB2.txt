i am all against driverless cars because there are many problems with this and there always will be, but for example cars will be more like trains. Yeah the cars will use half as much fuel as todays taxis, but I mean how would you drive to a secrect camping spot or something and there wouldnt be any more movies where a car crashes into a wearhouse because the car brakes as soon as it senses the wearhouse, and how would you out run the cops or some maniac in a car chase? you wouldnt. Our knowlegde on how to drive will change and there will be a generation that doesnt know how to drive manually for example it the article it says that and it would be pretty sad. The best way i can put it is it would be sad that it would be like we are losing or free will or our right to drive how we want.
