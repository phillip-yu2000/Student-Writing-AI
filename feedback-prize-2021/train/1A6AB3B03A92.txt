yes i think the use of the new technology called the (Facial action coding system) would be a good use because of they way they use it because that way you can tell and know the way a person really feels about you. Like for example like if your in class and you wanted to see like if you were the student you wanted to see how the teacher really felt about you, Just like if you were the teacher and you wanted to see how all your different students felt too and it would let yk the exact way how that perticular person felt at that time. You would also know if that student had something really wrong with them like if something was going on outside of school or like at home or like if they just had something really heavy they needed to get off their chest and they probably just needed someone to talk to and you could be that person that could really help them out and be the one to lift their sperit up.
