Dear, principal

I understand that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. I believe that students like i are responsible to be allowed to use our cell phones during lunch periods and other free times. There may be someone important we have to speak to like our parents. I no that sometimes while im in school i either forget my lunch money or gym cloths for school. It would be a big help if we were aloud to use our phones.

Also as the principal you wouldn't want children in your schools to fail gym or class because they forgot there homework or cloths at home. A lot of people today always forget things in my school. Children shouldn't fail because they forgot to take something to school because everyone makes mistakes. Instead of sitting during free time since you got nothing to do you could always use your phones to entertain yourself. In my cousins school they have permission to use there phones during free time and lunch and i think we should be able to too.

Probably no one would do something inapropriat on their phone cause he or she wouldn't want to be the reason to not be able to have use of their phones. Some teachers wouldn't want their students to use their cell phones because they might do something foolish and iresponsible, but if children have the privlege to do more things and be trusted they could most likely act more mature. You should really think about this policy it could be a great help for a lot of students to do well in school. Also if you do better in school the school acedements would be higher and the teachers would get a higher amount of payment each week. All of this could posible happen if just you allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. Since using phones during school could be a great idea, you should really consider the schools policy.
