Have you ever wondered why seeking more than one person for advise is better than asking from one person. More than one person is always good especially when you are looking for advise. Also you can get more answers than from one person. Seeking advise from more than one person is better than just one person because one you have more answers to listen to, also different people to get advise from.

First there are more answers to your problems when you have more people . First they can give you better advise than one person. One person can give you advise but with multiple people they have different perspectives than one person. Secondly it is more help full than one person like I just said more than one person can help you more because of how different they are and how they think. Also more people that you can ask the better advise you can take back from and you will probably make better choices

.

There are a lot of people you can get advise from like your friends for example. Your friends are like family and they probably know you a lot maybe not better than you parents but they know how to help you when you need it. The second person you can ask for advise can be your mom she probably knows yo the best out of every one and she knows what is best for you and what is not best for you. Lastly the last person you should get advise from is your school counselor. Your counselor can give you advise maybe not as good as your parents but they can give you some great advise so you can make better choices. All of those different people can help you with your problems and will give you great advise.
