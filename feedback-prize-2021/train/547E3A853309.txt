Phones and driving

Phones are something that almost everyone has now. They are good to use for many reasons but one thing that there not good for is when you're driving there are a lot of distractions already over 100 cars, blind spots people in the car music but the biggest is phones, with phones your taking your eyes off the road and anything could happen when your eyes is hooked in the screen for a split second. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds

It is safer to just stop with phone and driving because they don't mix right in the end and they will be less mistakes on the road because of it the best way to see it is that there other people lives on the road and it wouldn't be cool if someone die because if one text or call
