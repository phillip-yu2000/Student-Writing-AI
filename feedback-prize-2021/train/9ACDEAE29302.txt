Diverless cars would be a very bad idea. This could not only cause many accidents, but it could also be a reason for anyone to not drive. Also driverless cars would never be driverless because in the passage, paragraph 2,

they talk about how the cars still need drivers for the cars to go in and out of driveways.

What will happen to drivers ed? Will the next generation ever learn to drive a normal car? The next generation needs to know how to drive a normal car just in case something happens. Such as, they are not financially stable to buy a driverless car or they simply just want a normal car.

When driving you need a seat belt to make sure you dont go flying out of the car in an accident. In paragraph 8 they mention safety. How do you know your children, friends, or family will be safe riding in a driverless car? Many accidents could happen. You could be risking yourself to the car breaking down or taking control on its own. Maybe even catching on fire. They mention putting cameras in the car to make sure are paying attention to the road instead of being on your phone texting or being distracted. If you are buying a driverless car wouldn't your intention of buying that car would be of not driving at all and enjoying the ride?

Also in paragraph 9, the question is mentioned of who will be responsible, in case of an accident, of the injuries of a person, the driver or the manfucaturer? In case of an accident this would be the real question. Who is responsible? The driver for buying the car? or the manufacturer for making it?
