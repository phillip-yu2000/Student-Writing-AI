Dear Principle,

I know that you are thinking about requiring all students to perform community service her at our school. I think that you shouldn't make this a requirement. Kids in our school, including myself, have a lot of other responsibilities that we have to do. I know that my schedule is filled with all ready. I have to play sports three times a week, go to church, and have school activities that I have to attend to. On top of all that I still have to finish all my school work and projects. With all the things that I have to do there is no way possible to fit community service into my schedule.

If you were to make this a requirement then you would find a lot of grades slipping in school because of all the time doing community service and not doing school work. With community service as a requirement I would have to cut out some of my other activities after school, which I would not like to do. I would also have to work extra hard on finishing all my school work.

I am not saying that community service is bad. I actually think community service is a good thing to have. Some students clean up litter around are community and some students tutor elementary school children. All of these things are good and really make a difference in our community. Community service is a good way to help out in our community. It helps how are community functions.

I don't think that what you do in your personal time should have a conflict with school. If you have time or just really want to help out your community you should do some community service.

Overall I don't think that community service should be a requirement in school. You should do community service on your own time.

I hope that when you make a choice, you consider my letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
