Asking for advice is something people do when they don't know what to do or want someones opinion. When people ask for advice, they often find themselves asking multiple people. People often ask for advice on things like equipment, vehicles, homes, products. People also ask for advice for things like what to do in a situation. When making a choice, it is better to get advice from many people than getting advice from one person. Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice because they hear more options and hear someones past experience.

People make better choices when they ask multiple people for advice because they hear more options. For Instance, if someone is shopping for a computer asking multiple people for advice will give them more choices. By learning about more options they will make a better decision on what computer to buy. By asking for advice from many people, they were able to learn about more options, which helped them make a better decision. That is one way asking for advise from multiple people can help someone make a better choice.

Someone can make a better choice if they ask multiple people for advice because they will hear their past experiences. An instance is, someone is buying a car, they ask advice from their parents, a mechanic, and a friend who knows about cars. By learning other people's past experience and more options from asking for advice, They were able to make a good choice. By asking for advice from multiple people they were able to make a good decision. This another way asking for advice from multiple people can help someone make a better choice.

And that is why seeking multiple people's advice can help people make a better choice because they hear more options and hear someones past experience. The examples above are two examples of how asking for advice from multiple people helps people make better decisions and why you should to.
