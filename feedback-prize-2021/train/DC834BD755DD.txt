Studying Venus is a very interesting thing . He very-well wrote the article " The challenge of exploring Venus ". He includes almost everything a person should and needs to know about the planet . You can tell just by what he has written that he is good at his job , and knows what he is doing. In my own personal opinion , i think he needs to add a little more detail and answers.

I happen to have a few questions myself . For example , how long has it existed ? Is it one of the oldest or newest planets ? Are any non-like humans able to even live there or would they explode from how much pressure/heat is on them? Why is it so hot there?

If it's not because of the sun , then what causes it ? I could go on but i think you get where i'm coming from. Because he didnt answer every question that could have been answered , im left with curiosity . Other than that , he did a very good job at explaining what happens on Venus . I also dont think it's very smart how he said " Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation " .

It seems to me as if he's trying to make it as a fantasy or a game . What happens to him and others that decide to visit Venus is a very serious and real-life thing. Some people dont want to die . The way he said it made it sound like he doesn't care , just as long as he dies having fun and believing it's an " imagination ". It's definitely nothing to play around about , it's very serious and dangerous.

Peoples lives are at risk and i don't think they want to die on purpose. People have families and would like to live long enough to return back to earth to see them. They put their lives at risk everyday just to discover things from outter-space or things on another planet. This article is written nicely , i just think it needs to add more answers and be more live-like.
