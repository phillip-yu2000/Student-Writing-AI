I think that driverless cars could be a great thing to have in the future, if they're safe enough to carry out the same actions that a driver can. In the future though, if kids grow up around driverless cars and aren't actually taught the rules of the road, then if there is an emergency that requires the drivers immediate attention as stated in the article, then the driver probably wouldn't know what to do. This can cause injury or even death to the people driving around him/her.

I also think that driverless cars could be a great thing for the future of technology, but the question that is asked in paragraph 9 of the article is very important to keep in the minds of the car manufacturers. If people rely on their car to do the driving for them, then if there is a wreck who is a fault, the driver or the manufacturer? If you do get blamed instead of the manufacturer, then I don't think that it is really fair because you weren't doing the driving and you trusted the driverless car to get you to your destination safely, and it didn't do that.

Considering these things though, if they were to teach the kids or even adult that didn't grow up around these cars the rules of the road and how the car works to prevent accidents like this from happening then i'd be all for driverless cars. They would be super cool in my opinion and if they worked correctly without many reported accidents, then i'd definitely try to get one. While taking drivers ed I was taught to be mindful of people around you and how your actions could effect other people and I just don't think that the driverless cars could really do that like a driver would be able to.
