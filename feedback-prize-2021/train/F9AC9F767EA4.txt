Luke bomberger had an interesting story to tell about his adventures on board the SS Charles W. Wooster. He saw many beautiful places and met many interesting people, as such he would recommend the program to somebody. In the following paraghraphs I will present luke's arguement and hopefully convince you to join "The Sea Going Cowboys.

Luke starts his story as a young boy [fresh out of high school] working at a grocery store and a bank, when his friend Don Reist invited him to work on a cattle boat with him. He accepted and went off on the cattle boat bound for europe. Luke seems to have had fun working with the 335 horses on their first trip to europe and before arriving in Greece, luke turned 18. As such he was drafted.

Luke was told just to continue working on the boat for his servince so he spent another two years working on the boat. He says that he helped alot of people in China and Europe but he also got the benifit of seeing wonderful sights and places; like the Panama Canal and Acropolis or Venice. He says that aside from his adventures he learned of how lucky he is to have things like food and a job when people in the countries he visited were much less fortunate.

Enough about all this seriousness, let's talk about the fun activities on the ship. Luke said that the men on-board played all kinds of games like Base-ball and volleyball in empty holds when the animals were gone. The men also enjoy games like boxing fencing and best of all, reading; the men also had tournaments for table tennis.

So, in short you get paid for working a third of the time, exploring foreign countries the second third of the time and playing games the last third of the time. There's no other way to describe it other than "Best job ever."
