If I were apart of this I would agree with you and go against you. I have some possible reasons why the school policy should change, and why not the school policy should change. The reasons the school policy should change is because some students don't do their work and some do, but in high school you do need a B average to get into sports. But other activities you don't. You can join any club you want to join in. But there are a few activities you need a B or an A average. Like the national Honors society club, computer science, etc. Reasons on why the school policy should not change is because there are so many different activities across the universe. some activities give you extra credit for a class if your failing it. Now sports is different sports, you have pass a semester or you will never play a sport that happens everywhere in high school and college the school policy should not change for sports, because the students who fail and don't pass the semester have to keep trying and trying until they get a B average.
