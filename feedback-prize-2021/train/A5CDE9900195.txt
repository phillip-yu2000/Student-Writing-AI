The photograph was not proof of an alian civilization it was just a land formation that hapens near where the photo was taken. Also conspiricy therist have no solid evidence that the formation is of any alian origen.

So,if the formation was of alian origen nasa would probly not have put the photo out for every one to see, they would want to do more reacerch and get more data on it.

If it was of some alian origen nasa would send a rover to check it out and get more information about it and then make it there top priority to send a maned mishion to mars to colect data and bring back as much as they could of the artifact. Finnaly,thats why it was no alian artifact just a land formation on the face of mars.

Next,conspiricy therist have no proof of the artifact being of alian origen they just asume that the landformation thats sticking out of the ground is alian because it has basic facial featers besides that they have no real evidence.

In conclushion that is why the land formation is nothing other than a land formation and nasa has all the evedence to prove so. And concpericy therist dont have a shred of evedence to prove other wise.
