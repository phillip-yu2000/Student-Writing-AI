I believe that driverless cars would be benefitial. 90% of the time you don't have to drive. There is an in-car entertainment system so that you can relax and watch movies or whatever you want to do while the car is driving you to your destination.

But when the sensors in the car know you're in the driver seat, the entertainment will shut down so that you can focus on your driving. No other cars are like this one; sure there are the cars that can steer themselves or brake themselves, but they still need you to drive the car. The driverless car won't need you to drive it because it can drive itself. It's really an awesome car.

There are still certain states that have laws that state that the car would only be safe IF there is a human driver in control of the wheel. But, with the more advanced technology, they can show the states that the driverless car is perfectly safe. They would also help with decreasing the amount of accidents the United States has dramatically.

In conclusion, I believe driverless cars are very safe, very reliable, and very cool.
