Venus is worth searching and studying because it might have been the most earth like planet in the solar system. Long ago, venus was probable covered with large oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that venus can sometimes be our nearest optioon for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission safe and scientiffically productive.

I think that venus should be explored because then there could possibly be new life there and we can have a new planet that possibly people could go to but it wouldnt be possible for many more years. It would be dangerous exploring venus because it is really hot there. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray usuing a blimp like vehicle that is about 30 miles above venus. The tempature would still be like 170 degrees but air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed earths levels. Not easy conditions but it would be survivable for humans.
