The author suggests that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus has her terrible conditions. He gives several examples. One of the examples is that, on Venus there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets it. To even make it harder. The clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acidbin the atmosphere.

The second example is that scientists are still talking abot making a vist there when they know the surface is to dangerous. There are astronomers that are real amazed at Venus because they belive the Venus was once almost like Earth a really long time ago. Venus long ago was probably covered with oceans and could have had various life forms like Earth. Venus till this day has a rocky surface, valleys, mountains and craters like Earth. The value of retuning to Venus seems indisputable.

The last example is that NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Imagain a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the surface of Venus. It would sit 30 miles above the surface For it being that hogh it would avoid the conditions of Venus but it would still be hot. It would be about 170 degress Farhrenheit, but the air pressure would colse to sea level. It would not be easy conditions but it is survivable for humans. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but we should expand the very edges of imagination and innocations.
