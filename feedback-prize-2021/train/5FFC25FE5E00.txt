I am against driveless cars for many reasons. The first reason being that there is a high posiblity of getting into a wreck. Your car might not see an animal or a person walking the streets and you might not have enough time to turn it back to manual so that you can swerve away from it. Driveless cars can also be very scary in my opinion, I mean, we are so use to driving, we might accidently forget it is driving itself and get freaked out of scared.

Another reason is the technology could mess up at any moment. What if your car ran into a puddle? Would that affect your car at all? It might not but I wouldn't want to that that chance. I also would feel as though whoever else is in the car with me, or on the streets, would be in danger if I let the car drive.

I just don't think driveless cars are very safe. What if the car glitches and won't let you take control? You could not only putting yourself in danger, but others as well. I also think it would be creepy having a car watch me while I'm driving. What if i parked to the side and had to change real quick? Would it see anything? I sure hope not!

On an ending note, I think that driveless cars sound like an amazing idea but they probably would take 10 years to make perfect. Or else people would most likely waste their money on a car that glitches a lot, super dangours, no control over them, and could cause a wreck very easily.
