I agree with having extracurricular activities, they can also help you so much as life grows. Extracurricular activities can help you get more knowledge about what you are doing, it will help you in the long run with collage, and it can help people get something off their mind.

First of all, if you play sports you can learn any knowledge from hearing or even watching he T.V. screen. There was this one time when I was getting ready to get on a horse and my horse trainer said "make sure you always tighten up your girth before you get on the horse." Then she showed me the reason why she would always tighten her girth before she got on.

Second, extracurricular activities always help you in the long run if you want to go into collage. The people who except you in are the people who have checked your grades, sols, and even check your sport status to see if you got any scholarships. They want to make sure that you did not get in trouble a lot. Because if you did you will not go into collage.

Lastly, you can always help people who try extracurricular activities if they want to get their mind off something if they have a hard life or just want to do something fun. Sometimes when I am sad I like to see my friends and they always cheer me up.

I think doing extracurricular activities is a 100% recomended if anyone wants to try it. Extracurricular activities can help you get more knowledge about what you are doing, it will help you in the long run with collage, and it can help people get something off their mind.
