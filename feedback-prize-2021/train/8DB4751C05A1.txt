"Phones and driving"

Today's generation, phones are becoming an issue on the roads and putting people's lives at risk.

Phones should not be allowed to be touched or played on as you are on the roads so that you are fully aware of what's going on in your surroundings and also not taking your eyes off the roads. Texting while driving may ruin yours or another person's life.

There are a lot of risks that could happen and put your life or someone else's lives in danger. Most people pick up the phone because they say it's important, but even then the phone would be a distraction. Take a moment to sit and think about how many accidents occur because of a text, now think about in old times when texting while driving was not a problem at all.

Authorities put down strict detailed laws about having your phone in your hand while driving. Each offence doubles every time you get caught but this law was hardly effective because no one is taking the safer advice to insure the safety of yourself and others on the roads. The fines would turn into something more serious and if you got into a wreck, injuring another person you could more than likely spent some jail time.

I know phones shouldn't be allowed to be messed with while you are driving because imagine if it were you in the situation and getting into a wreck all because someone was paying attention to their phone and not the road. You could lose it all in a blink of an eye or you could make someone else lose everything, don't be that person because either one there are causes and effects to your actions even if you didn't get hurt , you probably hurt someone else that has family that loves them like crazy.
