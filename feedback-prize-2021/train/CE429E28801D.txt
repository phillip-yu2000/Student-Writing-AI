Driverless cars are more safe because they alert you when you are about to hit something by vibrating the drivers seat .They also brake on there own when you are to close to a car or an object. They have sensors that sense when a stop light has changed colors. They also can steer themselves and hold accelerateion. Also the self driverless cars are good because alot of people are texting, eating, and putting make-up on while driving and this would decrease accidents having to do with distraction.

Driverless car are more advanced. The driverless cars has been around since the 1950's just not as advanced as they are today. They are more advanced in technology because they have updated sensors, cameras and GPS receiver.
