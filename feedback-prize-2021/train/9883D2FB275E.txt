You should join the seagoing Cowboys program because you help a lot of people. You take care of different animals. The work is hard, but you'll get use to it and have fun. You should come join us and have some fun.

You helped people that fought for the country. These people almost lost their life in World War Two. It feels great to help out. It's giving back to the people who almost died for us.

It's hard work, but you'll get used to it and start having fun. Once I broke my ribs but I didn't quit. I worked harder and longer. I had to sit out until my ribs were better. When they heeled I was back to work in no time.

Last you get to work with farm animals. I feed the horses and give them water. After a while you make a strong bond with these animals and take care of them like they're yours. It's hard work because you have to fed them three times or twice a day.

Come join the seagoing Cowboys. We will enjoy your comings. We need more people to help out, so if you have a freind tell them to join as well. That's why you should join the seagoing cowboys.
