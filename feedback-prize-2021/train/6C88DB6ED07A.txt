Would you feel safe knowing that you were putting your life into a computer's "hands"? There are many positive and negative examples on driverless cars. I have looked at the negative effects and I have chosen to be agaisnt the idea of driverless cars. I have chosen this mainly for safety reasons.

One reason that I am against the development of driverless cars is the safety concern. In paragraph nine it explains how these driverless cars are currently unsafe to drive in certain road conditions. These conditions may include pulling in and out of locations, dealing with complicated trafic issues, and navigating through roadwork and accidents. As a result, in almost all states it is illegal to even test driverless cars. There are currently only three states in the country that have "limited" use of semi-autonomous cars, California, Nevada, and Florida. The car manufacterers say in the soon future more states will add to this list as soon as the cars are proved reliable and safe. With that said even if they become legal in more states, new laws will need to be added in order to cover liabilty if there would so happen to be an accident. Another concern of mine is, what if this driverless car were to malfunction? Let us say I was in the passenger seat of my driverless car. What if I were to fall asleep?

You've heard the story, now it is your turn to decide. Should you feel safe without the car under your control and in the "hands" of a computer?
