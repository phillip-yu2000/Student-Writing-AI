Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think the policy number one is better. Maybe not all students will listen but I'm sure that they wont listen to police number two. Most all of our students have cell phones and they do bring them to school. Also many students bring their cell phones because their parents tell them too.

Cell phones can actually help sometimes. For example, if a student saw something that is not suppose to be happening, they can just make an emergency call and do a lot of help. I can see reasons why students are not allowed to bring their cell phones, but if they do teachers can just get them into trouble and they wont do that anymore. If they will then that's when you don't let them bring it to school at all.

Some students need a cell phone because they need to make a call right after school, and I did see people be in that kind of situation. They could be home alone and they need some to pick them up. There are many more reasons of how the cell phone is help full foe the students in SCHOOL_NAME.

There are also many reasons of why you should make it be in the policy number two. Some students are scared to get caught with their cell phones because they know that they are going to be in trouble at home. Some don't care and they do some students get caught with using a cell phone, and when the teacher tells them to give it to me they just don't listen and then they get in a lot of trouble.

I see how there could be arguments but I still think it would be better if we would go with the policy number one. Yes i see how it could be a problem but still many students will have their cell phones of during class time. But i know that a lot of our students wont listen to policy number two and that will get them mad and for sure they wont follow that rule. Also students that wont listen to policy number one still will get in trouble. So i thin that policy number one is better.
