Dear Madam,

In my opinions you should not change the school policy of having a B average to join sports.

We should keep it how it is.

Most kids in are school have those grades to get in sports and if you take it away, you may make the child not want to try anymore.

They will just say or think if I can't get a B or A what is the point of doing a sports.

But in a different case that would be a smart idea.

Not only you will make them try harder, you will make them think a little differently.

If they are a C student and you push them to get better grades they might think if I can get a B I can do better.

And you can turn them into a whole new person. They can walk away with a little self pride in them and a smile on there face.

So if I was you I would bump up the grade into a C+ and then later in time you can change it into a B then so on.

That will make the child say I am can't be a C student i can be something more in life.

And so with that little of a challenge can lead to something else. But I cant tell you how to do your job, that is just my opinion.

But I want you to think I'm not just doing this for me i am doing this for every kid that thinks they can only have a C in their grades.

It can go earthier way, it can go the bad way. Where the child thinks, he/she can't get passed a C or where the child says yes I can take that challenge and go for the sport.

But in this case the child might not want to. Because they are getting older and might think they can get somewhere in their life.

And may not need the sport or the B. But i am still against this policy I think it should stay at the C range.

The students don't need to worry about getting a B average.

Sincerely,
