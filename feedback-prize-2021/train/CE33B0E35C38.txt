The technology of " Facial Action Coding System" should not be used to read students emotions to read in a class room and the use of this technology is not valueable. Why? because no student would want to let a machine tell what their emotions are and what they are feeling. In the text it says that this technology can calculate when your face is sad, happy, angry, scared, bored.

This technology won't be able to detect all the movements of the face and detect what our feelings show threw a smile we put on our face .

Not all technology work well and if this technology were to detect a humans feelings trew their face it wouldn't work because not all tecnology work well and everyones face is different. How would you be able to detect a older humans face and a younger humans face?, not all technology would be able to calculate that and this technology will possibly pick up the wrong feeling the person makes. The person might feel sad but their face might show a bit of anger or a person might be feeling calm and relaxed but the technology might pick up that the humans face might be angry . You might be able to tell a persons feelings their the face they make, because maybe this person might be your friend and you know what faces they make when they are worried or mad or sad. Not this technology especially if it has never detected a new before and every single persons face is different. My opinion to this is this technology would not be a very good idea especially if a technology knows more about your feelings then you do. Some people might put on a happy face to show others that they are okay and nothing is bothering them but inside they might be in trouble or worried.

Many people hide their feelings/emotions so no one can make such a big deal out of them.
