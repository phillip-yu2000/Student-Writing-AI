Luke's Point Of Veiw

"Come on! Please join with me!" I begged. "It will be so much fun!"

"No. I don't want to. It seems boring." Sam said.

"Don and I are doing it. Wouldn't you want to help someone in need?" I said.

"How about this, I will talk it over wiht my parents and see what they think, then I will make the final decision. Ok?" he explained.

"Ok. Meet me at the Big Tree tomorrow at 3." The we bothed walked off.

I really hoped that Sam would agree.

We would be like the three muskateers! I thought.

Don, Sam, and I have been best friends since I could remember. DOn had already been my neighbor, so when Sam moved in a couple houses down we decided to start being friend swith him. I'm glad we did.

Don and I have been apart of the UNRRA for a while now, and we were home for a brake. Our only mission while being home is to try and get people to join. We already got a couple, but we needed more. There is always work to be done on the ship.

"Hi Mom." I said walking into the kitchen. "Dinner smells good."

"Good. How was your day?" she asked. "Anybody new recruited?"

"Still working on Sam. He said he would tell me his final answer tomorrow." I told her.

We ate dinner and then cleaned the dishes off.

"Mom, is it ok if i go back out to town?" I asked.

"Sure. Just be back before dark."

I went to the common area because there is normally still a lot of people ther at this time eating, playing with animals, or little kids running around. I walked into the common and sure enough, people were there.

As I was walking, I felt a tap on my back.

"Looks like we had the same idea, Luke!" It was Don.

"Yeah! So glad you're here. Have you gotten anyone?" I asked.

"Yeah actually. Those men sitting over there talking." He pointed to 3 men chatting on a bench.

"Good job!" I congradulated him. "Sam and I are meeting at the Big Tree tomorrow for his final decision. He said he was going to talk it over with his parents tonight."

"Oh good. Let's go get some more people." he replied.

"Hello." I said to a man around my age petting his dog. "I'm with the UNRRA group, the "Seagoing Cowboys" and I was wondering if you are interested in it."

"Hello, and sure. Tell me about it." he said, with a kind smile.

"What UNRRA stands for is the United Nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration and what we do is carry animals on ships to different places. FOr example, we went to Greece and unloaded there. We carry horses, young cows, and mules. We also have spare time on the ship. We do table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, readong, whittling, and we can play volleyball and baseball." I explained.

"That sounds very exiting!" Where do I sign up?" he askeed.

I handed him a paper. "Put your adress, first and last name, and age on here. We leave in a week to head bak c out, so in a couple of days someone will show up and say if you are drafted or not."

"Thanks!" He said after signing the paper.

It was getting dark, so Don and I decided to head home together. We talked about small things like where we might go nest, how long we will continue doing this, and we also talked about other jobs we might want.

I got home and went to my room. It was a long day, so I went to bed shortly after.

I woke up to the sun peering into my room through the window. The house already smelled like blueberry muffins.

"Good moring, sweetie." my mom greeted.

" Good morning, Mom. Muffins smell good." I said.

"Eat up." She put a plate in front of me with 2 muffins. I devoured them pretty quickly.

At 3 I am meeting Sam for his decison. I hope he decides to do it." I said.

"Me too. It would be fun for the three of you."

A little later I took the papers of all the people I have gotten to my boss. He lived right in town. It took me about 10 minutes to get there.

I knocked on his door.

"Hello Luke!" he said.

"Hey Mr. Kyle. I brought you some more papers of people." I told him.

"Great!" I will look through them right now actually." he exclaimed.

"I might have one more later today also." I said, getting exited.

"Wonderful. COme back and let me know, alright? he smiled.

"Will do." I walked back to the sidewalk.

I went to the library, the market, and the barn just to kill time. It eventually became 3, so I walked to the Big Tree. Sam was already there.

"Hey Sam!" I Greeted him.

"I'll do it!" he exclaimed.

"Really?" I asked.

"Yeah." he replied.

"Great!" Let's go to Mr. Kyle." I said.
