Dear Principal,

I think you should go with Policy 1 because some kids text in school no matter what and most never get caught. I think kids will do better in school if they can text and use their phones at lunch and free time.

Kids want to talk to their friends during the day, friends that they don't see until lunch or even the end of the day. If teachers would remind them to turn their cell phones off during class so they would pay more attention to what they are teaching, they might do better in class. If students had a test the teacher could take all the cell phones and put them in a bucket or a box, and the students could have them after everyone was done with the test so they wouldn't cheat.

Students wouldn't get into so much trouble if they could just use their cell phones, because most of the time that is why they get in trouble is for having them out. So that is why I think you should go with Policy 1.

From,
