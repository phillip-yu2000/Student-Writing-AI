Dear principal, I STUDENT_NAME a student in SCHOOL_NAME do not like your opinion in the new policy

. The grade doesn't mater in sports or in talent . The grades shouldn't matter because they don't belong in sports. What if you wanted to play a sport in your school but you have low grades and cant play , how would you feel ? Well i would feel not important and not valuable. I really like that sport but cant play it because of my grades . Its not fair that only people with good grades or a b average can play sports . What if I was one of the best soccer players and I have a c average , would you let me play or would you let the soccer team loose in all of the games , and be named the worst soccer team in Texas. Or would you leave the policy as it is. Not change anything and let me play ,and make the soccer team win, and be named the champions because we always win in all of the games .
