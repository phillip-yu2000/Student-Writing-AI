Dear Principle:

Many athletic students are not very smart. requiring a "B" average to play sports is not fair to us students. It is not fair because many of us have "C" averages and sports are supposed to be for people that are passing.

You have to consider the passing athletic students eligible. You would basically be taking away their lives. You have to take factors like this into consideration before making rules like that. With this said you need to be more considerate of the people. America is a country for the people. We were created to get away from such rules not to rebuild the rules on another continent. Also ,No offense to the smart kids, but they would really mess up our sports program. If you like this school, You'll not make that rule

Please hear me out in this letter. I do hope this has changed your mind about the "B" average to play sports rule. If not then you will most likely be ruining hundreds of sporty kids lives. You will make their parents mad at either them or you. So once again I say hear me out. If you don't, it could be the worst decision you've ever made in your career as a principle.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
