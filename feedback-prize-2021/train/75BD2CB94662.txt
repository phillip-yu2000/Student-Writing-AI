Dear principal,

I have been told to write a paper on whether or not it is fair to allow students that have a B Average just be allowed to play sports. I think that isn't a good decision. Not all people have good grades but are really good at sports. They may be missing out on a good opportunity.

Although the grades do matter in ways.

It can be both good and bad. For example if you avoid all the people below a B Average then there's not going to be much people on one team. Also some people may be very smart and be very good at sports. So that means that you may be missing out on a great opportunity, some people are better then others. You shouldn't always judge a person on their grades.

There is also some good. Most people that are really good at a sport plan on taking it to college. When you go to college you have to have really good grades or else your not going to make the team. Basically all NFL players or any other player had to go to college and make good grades. Also if your a good player and make good grades then that would be 2 times better. So you would probably get more of a better chance to take it big into the real world.

So they should keep in mind that when they feel like fooling around in school and don't feel like doing any work that if they like the sport they play then kiss it goodbye because their not going to go anywhere with those grades. Grades matter so make sure they do their best.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
