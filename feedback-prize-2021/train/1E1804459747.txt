I believe that we should not need to have a B average to play sports. For all the students who have a C average don't get to play because of one grade lower than the one your supposed to have.

One reason is that some of the good kids that play sports well should at least have a chance if they have a C. If we left it to the students who had B' s and not even good at sports we lose every time.

Some of the kids that have C' s might not be the smartest but we wont be called the loser school with a horrible team. Also my history teacher / basketball coach wouldn't appreciate a horrible team.

Another reason is we need good kids on our sports teams. We have won some amazing games with the people we had for this entire time. We would lose a couple of games here and there but imagine losing all the time.

So I'm begging you TEACHER_NAME not to put b average as a policy think about our rep as a good school and a good team. I don't want to represent such a bad team i want and need a good team we can count on. So just understand my position and what i mean by keeping it at c average and not b average.
