From the article "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" it describes many reasons about how venus is not safe, but once along time ago could've looked like earth. Venus also know as Earth's "twin" is very close to earth. Venus has very many reasons about why humans havent been on it in three decades. "no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours" which tells me exactly how dangerous it actually is.

"on the planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit" which is extremely difficult to survive on. Imagine people from Earth going up to a place with 800 degrees Farenheit, no-one would make it out alive. Venus which "97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere" which to me as very deadly as well.

Having all this horrible enviroment, it "would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals." which in my opinion would kill anyone their. Despite how deadly Venus seems, scientist want to go visit it anyway because they believe humans and animals lived on it before. "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"

Since astrounauts can't take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance is nearly impossible because of its conditions. Hovering in a ship above Venus is limited to ground level because you cannot seethat far. Also sense light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.

From all about what i've learned i can tell that Venus is extremely difficult for any living thing. Since astrounauts haven't landed on Venus in three decades proves that its way far from safe. Being able to not get samples such as gas, rocks, or anything they will never be able to tell if humans lived on it long ago making me believe that Venus is beyond dangerous and should be avoided.
