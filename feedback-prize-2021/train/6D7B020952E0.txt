Dear Principal,

I believe that policy #1 is the better choice for our school. I think that allowing students to actually use their phones during lunch or their free time would actually prevent many cases of students' phones to be taken up and interrupting class.

It would be more wise if we were allowed to have phones in school. For instance, if there is an emergency or any scheduling problems of some sort at school, then obviously the students would have to call their parents or friends to resolve any of those conflicts. Let's face it, if the students in our school weren't allowed to bring their phones, they would probably still bring them anyway. What if one of your students forgot a permission slip or homework that they really needed to bring to their next class, but had no way to contact or call their parents to bring it to school for them? What if they forgot their lunch money at home and had no way to eat? I think that allowing students to use their phones during different times of the school day is the right choice. Everyday, teachers take up at least a few phones during important class time that needs to be used teaching the class and not having to write out office referrals, using up the class time. I do agree with the second part of the policy that says that phones should be turned of during class. I am not one of those students who have the constant need to always run their thumbs texting and socializing in class. That's what we're in school for-- to learn, not to socialize with friends during class. So that's why students should be able to socialize on their own time, which is during passing periods throughout the school day or during the lunch period.
