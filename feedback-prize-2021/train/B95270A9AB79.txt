Principal,

Our school activities is a privilege to have. I agree that all students must contain a B average. What's the point of keeping the students after school if the cant keep their grades up?

I strongly believe that if they are struggling in their class work, then they need to be at home working on their homework. Once they show their coaches that they have improved on their class work, then they should get to be in their school activities. Athletes must have good grades to even be apart of the team, if they cant work hard enough on their school work , then they don't need to be on the team or apart of a group.

I can understand that they have C' s but they get help on their work so they can participate in the activities they want to be in. Education always come before anything else. I say that because when these students want to go to college but they cant maintain the grades for it, then they cant go. You may have all the talent in the world, but if your not passing your classes then what's the point of playing the sport? I believe you need to stress the fact that education is more important then other school activities.

I know when i want to play my sports, I always maintain a good grade average so i can participate. Plus, im not allowed to practice until my homework and studying is done. Im certain that most people believe in what I am telling you. Please take it in to consideration that students may not do other activities if they cant maintain a good grade average. I am happy that I get to share this information with you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
