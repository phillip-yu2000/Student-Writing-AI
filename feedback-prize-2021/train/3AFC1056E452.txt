Dear Principal,

I personally think that you should encourage community service but, not force it upon oneself. Many people have extra time to do helpful activities such as community service. For example, some have jobs or school that run late and are not able to do activities during the day. With the economy today in its depression many people work as many as three jobs just to support a family although they would like to help out to do their part. Some people have better jobs therefore earn more money and have time to do extracurricular things such as community service. I feel that if people do have the time they should, in fact, try to do something useful for the environment community or so forth.

When you make something law people are not going to want to do it, but if you stress the fact that it is such an important matter most people will want to help out.

Instead, however, i propose this; come up with a group activity that is fun and can help out the community while encouraging people to do good. You could get a class to take a field trip to the beach and help clean up the shores, but at the same time turn it into a picnic and a fun day at the beach.

This is my outlook on the current matter of community service, i hope you will look into it and consider my thoughts. I think that if we find a successful way to do this we can truly change the world one school at a time and get people involved of the matters of today.

There are a lot of issues pending at the moment such as global warming, pollution, waste, world hunger, and poverty. I consider community service important but i feel that to really make a difference people have to want to make a difference we cant for them to. This is why we must stress the issue and its importance and make people understand it better.

Sincerely ,
