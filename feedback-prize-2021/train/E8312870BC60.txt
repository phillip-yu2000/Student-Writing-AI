CELL PHONES AT SCHOOL?

Phones should be allowed to be at school because kids need to be able to talk to there friends, emergency, and to call home for needs.

First reason is kids need to talk to there friends. They can talk to there friends in the hall but they cant see them all the time. They need to be able to have a social life to. When your at lunch you sit next to all your friends, and talk to them so you can use your phone, and talk to them or text them. That is my first reason why should be allowed to have phones in school.

Second reason is we should be able to call in case of an emergency. What if you get really bad hurt and you need to tell your mom or dad to come pick you up. you can go to the nurse but then some people will pick on you and call you a wimp. Sometimes you need to call home if you not feeling so good because that can end up getting other kids sick to. That is my second reason why we should be able to have cell phones in school.

Last reason is to call home for needs. You sometimes need to call home and ask for some things you left at home. Some people play soccer or football and might have forgot there shoes (cleats) at home. Also the thing in school now for lunch is that you have to bring lunch money to school. You might have left it at home and now you cant eat. That's my last reason why we should be aloud to have cell phones at school.

We should be able to have phones at school because kids need at social life, emergency, and call home for needs. Many kids are forgetting things at home so it would be wise to consider cell phones at school.
