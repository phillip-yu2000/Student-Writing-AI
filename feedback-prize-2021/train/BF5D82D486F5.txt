Luke thought it was fun to participate in a Seagoing Cowboys program. It was an adventure for Luke also. Luke got to play games and meet new people. When Luke and other people had some free time they would play baseball,volleyball,and table tennis. Luke's job was scary sometimes one night Luke was the watchman. What a watchman does is check the animals every hour after making the report to the captain Luke slipped on a slippery ladder on his back. Luke's heart was pounding when he was going feet first into an opening side of the ship ,but a small thing of metal along the edge stopped him sliding. Luke was very happy that he was alive, but he could not work for a little bit because of cracked ribs. Luke's job is scary sometimes but most of the time it was an adventure for him. Luke said that this program "made me more aware of people of other countries in needs."

The awareness stayed with Luke leading his family members to host a lot of international students for many years.
