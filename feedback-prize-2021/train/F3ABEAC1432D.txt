Dear Principle,

I completely support you new policy. I believe that education is more important than extra circular activities. The only way a person can be successful is through education. Sports my make a successful person but the chances of that are very low. Education should be the most important priority in life, and for those who are not serious about their education, this could be a good incentive.

In every school you will find a group of kids who do not care for their education and are only interested in sports. Well, if these students cannot play sports because of their grades, they will be more driven to raise them. With these students raising their grades, other fortunate things may happen. These people could become more self controlled, and easily escape bad citations, like drugs or peer pressure. If this happens then our school would be full of determined, hard working students that play sports and also stay focused on their school and homework.

In all I believe that this would be a change that will effect the school in a positive way. This will make grades the #1 priority in our school, it will influence careless students to raise their grades, and it will fill our school a school with well rounded students.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
