The face on Mars is a natural landform. We have proven it here at NASA. We have taken pictures on different years and it has shown to change. Our new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from our Mars GLobal Survey spacecraft reveal the face on mars for what it really is. It is just a mesa. This is common on earth on the west side of the United States. Another reason it wasn't made from any alien or creature out there is because the moniters never found any monuments like that one and aliens moving around.

For people who think aliens did this, say that our camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds which we couldn't see much, think the aliens were probably hiding. people who believe in aliens strongly are going to find the slightest detail and use that for their evidence. Since this was a popluar icon more and more people are going to lie and make up stuff to make sure people believe it is true. They already made up a lie that we would rather hide from the aliens. These people are called conspiracy theorists.

The biggest proof we have that it wasn't made my aliens is our digital image. This was 3 times bigger than the pixel size. It would be able to see if there were objects in this picture like monuments or aliens. It could even see small shacks if there were any. Our spacecraft got to look at it a second time in 2001 and could see more better than the 1976 one. There was still nothing to be found but a natural landform.

Even if we did catch aliens in our picture we showed the same picture to the public for all to see. Nobody said they found an alien structure. If we didn't detect neither would anybody else.

This is why conspiracy theorists will always remain conspiraces. Because they have no soild evidence against us. We have acutul research to back us up. We kept looking at and studying it until we finaly came up with an answer to tell the world what it is.
