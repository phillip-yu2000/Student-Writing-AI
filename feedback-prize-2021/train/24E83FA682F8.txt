Sports Grade Requirements

If the principle made it so you could not do sports use less you had at least a B average most of the students would hate it. also a lot of the sports team would not be able to play in a lot of the games if they majority of the players did not have the grades to be able to play. I personally wouldn't like because if i had a bad week at school and i had a C+ then i wouldn't be able to play any sports for a while till my grade gets back up. also kids might just stop playing the sport because they might think that they don't have the capability of getting and keeping a Band do the sport at the same time. I think that if you have a C in a class you should be able to sports.

It might be a good idea because then kids would get there grade up higher so that they can play sports. so it might work while they are playing a sport, then when the sports season has ended and they don't play another sport there grades will go back down so it may work for a period of time. but it also might be able to get them to the point of a B and show them that they can do it and maintain the B average for a while.

So it would probably be a good thing for a while till the spots season ends then they will probably go back to being a C student again. I think that if you have a C in a class you should be able to sports.
