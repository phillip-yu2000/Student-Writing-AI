In the article "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" Luke was a young seventeen-year-old boy who couldn't turn down the opportunity of a lifetime to go to Europe and help with the horses.

Some of the reasons to join the seagoing cowboys is that they get to see tons of awesome landmarks. If you love horses and cattle then is most likely the job for you. You get to enteract with them and feed them care for them like they were your own. Even if you just want to help out your world out then this could be the job for you.

It's amazing how much stuff you can do there to when the jobs done you might be able to look at the pretty things there. Sometimes if your lucky you have to go right through town so you get to see the pretty things on the way there. When it's time to go back home you play games where the horses were cared for. If seagoing cowboys were still around I would love to be one so badly. It would be so cool if I could be one too.

In conclusion, all i'm saying is that the seagoing cowboys would be something worth doing and worth while. You can go so many places and you rarely go to the same place ever. It sounds so cool and you never know where you'll go, hey you might just go to Egypt and see the pyrimids you just never know.
