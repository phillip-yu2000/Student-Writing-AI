Transportation will only advance throughout time. Today's so ciety has advanced from horse and buggy, to steam powered engines, to trains powered by a magnetic field. Cars have advanced from a gasoline powered engine, to an engine that can be charged up from an outlet. The next thing to do is to make transportation easier for the public by making it unnecessairy for them to do much work. The way to achieve this is to mass produce driverless cars.

Driverless cars are very efficent. They don't cause the driver to have to waste time doing the work. Now, the drivers can make phone calls or eat lunch safer than ever. Driverless cars will still require the driver to be aware of its surroundings and be alert for a problem to occur. This causes maximim amounts of safety for the driver, and others on the road. The car is designed to notify the driver if there are any difficulties. Today's society is already halfway to driverless cars, so why not take that extra step? It couldn't do harm, besides many lawsuits, but those could be prevented by making laws for these cars before they're made for the public.

Driverless cars could be very beneficial to society. It could cause so many improvements for other things to technologically advance, too. The work and studies are continuously being made for driverless cars. All transportation could be just as high-tech as driverless cars only if they are released to the public.
