Dear Principal,

I think that it is a great idea for allowing students to participate in sports, only if they have a B average. The students will try harder in their classes and most will actually pay attention to the teachers. They would not be focusing only on the sports their play and they would take their time to study. This could help the students to learn a lot more.

The students who play sports would listen to their teachers a lot more if you use this policy. In a poll it showed that 9 out of 10 students who plays sports do not focus on their academics only on the sports they play. If you let student who have a at least a B average to play sports then the student will surely pay attention to their academics. They will feel the need of getting a better grade.

The student will study on tests and quizzes to get a better grade. They would not leave it till the last minute. The students will take the time to learn the stuff the teacher teaches. In a research scientists found that students often do not have good grades because they focus too much on sports.
