Hey Generic_Name, can I ask you something? Sure, whatÂ´s up? said Generic_Name. Well I was wondering,do these shoes match my outfit or should I wear my Vans? Generic_Name told me that, Those shoes are super cute but they donÂ´t match. Sometimes I dont know what to wear or does the outfit match. So, I ask my friends and family their opinions. I believe you should ask people their opinion about certain things because people can guide you in the right direction and the personÂ´s advice might be helpful.

First of all, I feel like people opinions can guide you the in the right direction because most of the time, certain people want whatÂ´s best for you. For example,at school you come to learn. The teachers do as much as they can to guide you to success. In order for them to do that they have to share their opinion with you. Anyways, opinions can also save you. Save you from getting in trouble and looking crazy. I know because with the right personÂ´s opinion, you can be guided in the right path.

Next, opinions are sometimes helpful advice. Reports have shown that 78% of people in the world ask others for advice and they succeed right after they get it. Opinions can make you feel good while other opinions donÂ´t. I know because when I ask people opinions about certain things, I want their opinion to make me feel good but it donÂ´t always. I had to learn that itÂ´s not about what you want to hear itÂ´s about what you need to hear because thatÂ´s the whole point of an opinion.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that you should ask people their opinions because it could be useful in your future. The opinion could lead you in the right pathway. It can also be very helpful advice in which you will use forever. Maybe you will even give the advice to your friends and family. I hope you agree with my opinion. Thank you.
