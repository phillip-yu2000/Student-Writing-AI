Dear principal,

Well the idea of having a B average is bad and good at the same time. the bad thing about it is that mostly all the good player of a sport usually get a C average which is mostly common. sometimes coaches get mad because they know with out that person the team will loose or the don't stand a chance toward anybody. most kids dedicate their life into sports and that's what you all need to understand that we hardly are into school stuff well that's what i have notice from the other kids because their more engage in the sport there are in. for example when i have a game coming up that all i can think about and also brag about to people that's constantly in my head, but i know regardless what the other kids think i know that school comes first because with out the grades i cant make it anywhere in the sports industry.

The good thing about having a B average shows that we are committed to both thing and can accomplish it. also you get to see how we want to pass to be in the sport so we have to push ourself into doing our best if we want it really bad. by that it might even make our school more recognizable in the district and shows our ownership toward our goal so it could also be a good idea if you think of it this way because i know yall want a brighter future for all the kids in school some of us my look at is a caring way because we see that the teachers want us to go some where in life. i guess one day we would look back as a good thing to maintain our grades in a certain way and maybe kids might start doing homework instead of doing bad thing after school and start listening in class. this might also make us try harder in what we want and the goals we are reaching for.
