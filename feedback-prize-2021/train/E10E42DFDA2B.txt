Dear principal TEACHER_NAME,

I have heard that you want to make so only students with a B average to play sports. I have been on the football team for my whole time here at the school and I think that this is not fair what so ever. I have had a C average for the longest time and no one has given any problems about it. I understand the reasons that you would want to do this. You just want to help raise the students grades up. The only problem is that some people will have trouble trying to learn and will have to play their sports. We all have been on our teams since the first year we have gotten here. If you drop students from these sports, they will all be angry, tell their parents and the whole school body will be fighting against you. You will be seen has the man who ruined the school's sports, do you want this to happen? If so, then do it, cancel our sports, our way of interacting with others, meeting new people and learning new things about one another. You will also have a lot of people angry at you who will want you out of as principal. If not, then I hope that no one is kicked from the team. I hope to see that everyone that is suppose to be there will be there. This is a good idea, but you do not realize the bad results that will happen to you and the school. Now that you have heard all of this, please, let everyone be able to play school sports. If you do, I promise that we will try to bring our grades up without having to worry of losing our spots on the team. You wont regret keeping the old school policy!
