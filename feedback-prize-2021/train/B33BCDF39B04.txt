In 1976, a spacecraft from NASA, called Viking 1, was sent out to Mars to take pictures of where Viking 2 could land. Then the most unsual thing happened, the spacecraft spotted a "shadowy likeness of a human face." NASA is trying to prove that the Face is nothing but a natural landform. Since not everyone was satisfied, NASA continued to explain that the Face has nothing to do with Alien Monument.

NASA's discovery is leading to an argument over whether it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform. The text states, "The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien amrkings were hidden by haze." This evidence shows how people continue to believe that the Face could've have alien marking all around it, but they couldn't have been spotted because it was winter on the Red Planet so it was very cloudy to spot anything like that. Then on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. The text states "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size." This proves that if there were any Egyptian like pyramids or any alien type monument, you would be able to see it.
