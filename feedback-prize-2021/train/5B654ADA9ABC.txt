For Luke this expierence was heart warming and grabbing. He loved the part where he got to travel. The thing he loved most is when he stated "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China." I was amused when he said that he he was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. This is why Luke wants to pass on the expierence.

Luke thinks people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it is a once an a life time opportunity. Luke also likes the places he gets to go to such as China, and many other places like Greece. Like when it stated in the text "The cattle boat trips were an unbeliveable opportunity for a small-town boy." This is almost a life time of happy memories.

In conclusion this job is a life time of opportunity! If you get to help people who need your help. The best part is that your saving human kind. Luke thinks this will be a great way to travel and explore. Luke would love to encourage other people as he was incouraged. The End.
