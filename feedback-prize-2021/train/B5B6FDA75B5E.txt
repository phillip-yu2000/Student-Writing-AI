Cars with automatic driving, can you believe it? I personally believe driverless cars will be unsafe and unnecessary. There is no reason that we can't drive ourselves.

While the car drives itself, people still need to be aware of the things sorrounding them in case of an accident. Roadblocks are detected making the human take over on controls. If the person were to not pay attention, what could be the outcome? Wrecks, fatalities, and problems. Say that the person who is in the car pays no attention to the road. Instead he/she is playing on their phone. That causes danger to everyone else around. There is no way to monitor these people without invading privacy. Also, laws would need to change in order for these new drivers. Making things harder to adapt to. Not driving most of the time would take away the natural ability to drive.

There are some upsides to this invention. These new cars take half less gas than a normal taxi, saving money. As stated in the text "the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis." "It would also offer more flexibility than a bus" states the text. Get this, you would not have to pay for a car. There could be a public-transport taxi system that is cheap and affective.

In all, these cars could cause a major problem. At the moment there is more evidence against the cars than for them. It's cold hard facts. These should not be used, we should continue to navigate manually.
