I think driverless cars are a really good idea to be hounist I'm going to tell you why I think it's a good idea. The first reason why I think it's a good idea is, because if the cars are able to dive themselfs we the people will see less crashes on the rodes. Lets take I-65 for an example we the people see the news and we see and hear about all the crashes that happen on there. We also can look at I-70 as well its not as bad as I-65 though.

Here is another reson I think everyone should have a driverless car. I am a driver of my own. I get scared sometimes when i am on I-65 going to indy or anywhere like that. The reason being I dont want to get hit just going to the mall with some of my friends thats not what I want. This is what i want though. I want to be able to go place to place without hlaf to think or WORRY about any of the stupid people on the rodes.

I mean take a moment to think about how much better the rodes will be if stupid people can not drive places where they want to go. If people wanted to go some where the car will drive them there all we the peopel have to do is sit there and talk and have some fun. wouldn't that be so much fun though. There will be a lot less crashes and people dieing because of it.

The last thing that I would want to say is, lets thinks about all the little kids that are in the car and all the little kids getting hurt form being in a car where some stupid person hit the car and the kids get ether really hurt or even die. Just think about that for a litte bit. and Thinks about it when you drive today or when you start driveing. Dont be a stupid kid and race peopel and do bren outs and stuypid stuff like that. All you have to do is drive to one place to another.

That is really all I have too, want too, and need too say. About all of this. So if you ask me how I feel just remebre this essay. So yes i think we all need too get one of the driverless cars.

Thank you,
