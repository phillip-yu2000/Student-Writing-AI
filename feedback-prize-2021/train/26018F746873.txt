Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it is a good idea that students have required community service hours.

Because it would give us a chance to give back to our community, help people in need,

and it would give us a chance to see how easy we have it.

First off our community is good but it could be better. We have so many activities and sports events which are not cheap. But we students do enjoy them very much. I propose that we have community service hours so that we can raise money to help pay for these sporting events and buy things like equipment or uniforms, or help us go to far away tournaments. After all it is a privilege to play these sports not a nesety. By having these hours it would help our community be able to afford these things that makes our community so great. My next reason is there are people out there who don't have the things we have they don't have the greatest education, they don't have a nice warm bed to sleep in, or maybe they don't have a home at all. So by going to a soup kitchen or donating your old stuff to a group home. What ever it may be just show these people out there who are less fortune then us that we care and we want to make a change in there lives.

Do you get where I am coming from TEACHER_NAME we are one of the best schools in the state so lets be the school that cares about its community as well and the well being of its students to make them into better and more caring people.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
