I think the athor of this story did a good job explaining himself on why we should try to pursuit Venus. In the sencond paragragh he explained that Venus is the closest plant to earth in terms of density, size, and sometimes the clostest in distance. Then he explain some issue of landing on Venus because each previous mission was unmanned and the spacecraft could only survive for 2 hours. Then he started to talk about Venus thick atmosphere, clouds along with the temperatures and the atmospheric pressure. The reason saying all of this about Venus is a good idea becasue it gives the reader more information about why Venus would be hard to explore.

He also explains that Venus has the highest surface temperture of any the plants in our solar system. He also said that Venus geology and weather present additional dangers like erupting volcanoes, earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on the surface. Then he starts tlaking about how Venus at a point could have looked like earth. Venus long ago could of had oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. The plant has a surface of rocky terrian and includes familiar features like valleys, mountains, and craters.

All of this is why I think the author of this story did a good job of explaining why it would be a challage exploring it. He gave good facts about the plant and talking about what nasa is doing to try to explore the plant.
