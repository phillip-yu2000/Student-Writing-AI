The solar system has many interesting planets and those planets have many interesting landmarks. The Face on Mars just happens to be one of them. The face was found in a region of Mars called Cydonia. I feel as though it is a coincedence that a natural landmark on our neighborring planet looks like a human face. Many people say that The Face on Mars is just a legend, but we have scientifical proof of a face on Mars. The Face on Mars isn't an alien creation, but it is a natural landmark.

The Face on Mars is a natural landmark. It's a natural landmark because not only has it been there for a long time, but over the years we have found that it is a natural landform not an alien monument(JPL website). Many Hollywood movies have used the term "that face on Mars," but many people think that the face is evidence of life on Mars. Some scientists have compared the face to landmarks in the USA called buttes or a mesa. Many people also say that the face resembles an Egyptian Pharoah.

On the other hand, some people specifically NASA has used The Face on Mars as a way to show that some things are important for taxpayers to see. Like I mentioned before Hollywood has made many big selling movies about The Face on Mars. Also, many books and magazines have used The Face as a headliner. Some NASA defenders has said that they wish there was some sort of an ancient civilization on Mars to use as a motive.

The Face on Mars is a cool natural landmark. It was located in Cydonia an area of Mars. The Face isn't a legend at all. There is real scientific proof of a face. The Face on Mars isn't a hoax either. Many people think that it is a legend and a hoax, but it is a real natural landmark. The Face on Mars is not an alien creation, but it is a natural landmark. It deserves some attention.
