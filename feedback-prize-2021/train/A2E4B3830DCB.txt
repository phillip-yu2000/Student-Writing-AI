When fixingÂ a problem or making a hard decision, asking for advice on how to face it can almost always help with finding the best solution. However, when you need advice on something, one person's opinion won't do. You should always ask multiple people for their opinion.

More opinions will give you a bigger variety of options to choose from which increase the chance of finding the solution that will benefit you the most. Having different opinions might show you the pros and cons of each option and can help you make a smarter decision. Listening to more advice from different people will also tell you which tactic helped other people the most and is then very likely to help you. When you only ask for one opinion you don't know if what they suggest is going to help you the most or even help you at all. It is also important that you seek opinions from people who have different beliefs and think in different ways as asking people who think the same will probably tell you similar answers and won't give you an opposing view that will help you find a decision that you like. Lastly, it's okay to ask people who are biased toward one choice, but make sure that you always get other view points so that you aren't persuaded to make a decision you will regret.

When looking for advice, you should ask multiple people for their opinion. With more opinions you have a larger chance of finding the most effective solution. You can also use the pros and cons to help you decide on the best solution. Using the best advice you can now make the smartest choice on your issue and if you ever face it again.
