Dear, Mr. Principal

I think that we should have community service. Some of the reasons i think we should have community service are because then we could learn to help the community and not only our self.

Some other reasons are because we could learn new stuff and people would be very happy with our work. Also because if we do it and we might like it then we might do it when we are older. We should also do community service because we would be helping our school for it can be clean and it wont be messy. Another reason is for people could now not to make a mess and to clean up after them self. We should also do this for we can have respect for our school and for when we are outside of school and for we can know to pick up after our self every where we go.

sincerely,

your student STUDENT_NAME
