Caution Driverless Car

Imagine driving in your car and you come to a four way stop, you have the right of way so you preceed cautiously through the intersection and bang someone hits you. After taking a few seconds to gather yourself you get out the car to exchange information and you find out they were not driving the car, it was a driverless car, who's fault is it if they werent driving the car ?

A driverless car is an accident waiting to happen. We have the ability to prevent these accidents by simply driving ourselves. So many things can go wrong with the car, the sensors can malfunction and cause someone to crash. New things have the possiblity to create new problems. Driverless cars could be easily sabotaged, the parts on the car can be stolen, and many more.

So what would happen if the driverless car were to crash ? The person in the car wouldnt know if they are liable for the damages. We simply do not have enough rules or regulations to create a financially stable and safe enviorment for these driverless cars and the others around it.

Driverless cars have the poetential to be our future but still pose a hazard to the people around them. The cars are still dangerous and still have many problems to fix.
