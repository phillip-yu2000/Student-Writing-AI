Being close-minded to others opinion isn't always the best choice, when having more than one opinion you can learn and experience new things. My first reason why having more than one opinion on something gives you a better point of view on the decision you're about to make or the advice you're seeking. For example if you can't decide on what ice creamÂ flavor is better vanilla or chocolate, you can ask a friend which seems tastier than others. They're obviously gonna say chocolate. However, if its a life changing decision make sure that you get more than one opinion, it'll most likely help you make a better choice.

My next reason is when making an important decision by yourself is difficult and nerve-racking when you don't have someone to help you. Only having one point of view might not be the right mindset or choice. It can put a lot of stress on a person if they don't have a second opinion or someone supporting them. Some people need that extra support or need someone to tell them that they're wrong, not saying that they're always wrong, but thinking negatively can lead to bad decision making.

My last reason on why seeking multiple opinions is good is sometimes you're not sure if its the wrong thing to do, and getting the right advice from someone you can trust. Receiving different opinions might help you change your opinion on something and help you view stuff differently. A big part in decision making is getting your advice from someone you trust and also someone that is honest with you. Sometimes with the wrong advice from the wrong person might not help you make the right choice.

In conclusion receiving more than one opinion is good so you can keep and open mind to new stuff and have different views. Having your own opinions is important but just be open to others opinions.
