Grades in schools

Grades and sports are big things in many of the schools today. Sports are Great, usually people will play a sport that their friends play or a sport that they are good at and have fun doing. Grades are also big in schools, they show how well and how much the students are learning. Both of these things represent the school and can help get important grants or money that helps the school .

I play sports at my school and I think they are Great! I also try and usually keep an A average in my classes. So in my situation, I think that students should have a B average or higher. If I can do it that, other students can do it. If the students are willing to work hard enough to make a good grade in class than they should be a ready, focused player or participant in the sport.

Most people deal with this through their schooling. Some kids don't have the privilege because of health problems, disabilities, or if they or their parents don't want them to. If they don't play sports, the same should be true for clubs and after/before school activities. There really isn't any reason that you shouldn't make B average or higher of you just try. some students just don't care enough about school but, that's their choice and their future.
