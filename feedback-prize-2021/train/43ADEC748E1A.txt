Google is trying to make things easy by creating a driveless car. Im for these new cars I think it would make things alot easier for some driver's that get nervous and are not paying attenion to the road. It would be useful when your driver by an accident or proventing a accident driving by an construction site. It would kind be like taking a taxi or bus but not have worry about having to call and get a taxi or missing the bus and or finding a seat on the bus.

In article it states thier cars have driven half a mile without a crash but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless ; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents. The cars have been proven that they are caoable of driving witout crashing but there not fully capable of drivering by thereself. In the article it states Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position -estimating sensors on rear wheel. rotating sensor on the roof a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver , and an inertial motion sensor. That can help alot with people not checking the driveway as there sometimes late for work of just in a rush to get somewhere.

In conclusion i feel like the car would be a great help to people everwhere. It could stop alot of accident's and it help in traffic.
