The Face on Mars is not an alien monument or creation. A lot of people do think that it was made by some alien life form but they are mistaken. Scientists have done multiple studies to conclude that it is a natural landformation.

First of all, the formation is known as a mesa. There are shadows from the formation that give the illusion of eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Also in the picture from 2001 each pixel in the photo graph is 1.56 meters on the planet so you would be able to see any artifacts or structures if there were any.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not an alien formation. Scientists have proven this by the effect of the shadows on the rock, the fact that it is a mesa, and by there not being any artifacts on or around the formation. Therefore, this is not evidence of there being ancient civilizations on Mars.
