I think that attending classes from home can benefit students by giving them the freedom to take classes on their own time. Students who live in a different state or country can attend classes if they can't move. Being in the class can be a handful for many students,so schools offering distance learning is a great alternative for students. Imagine that you are somebody that wants to go to a certain school but you cant because you don't have money to move, you can attend your classes online. Students who work and can't attend classes can attend them online so they won't miss out on work or school.

Whether you're at home or in the classroom you are still getting the same learning, but it would be different at home than in the classroom. Being at home gives you the same benefits of being in the classroom and then some and it gives students opportunity to spend time with their family, but compared to being in school it doesn't give you the opportunity to socialize with your classmates. In school the teacher might give out an activity that requires you to come together as a group to finish the work, but if you are attending from home you can't do the same things they do at school. If you attend from home it gives you the opportunity to focus on your classes on your own time and also focus on your ambitions or hobbies that interest you.

In conclusion, distance learning as pros and cons that can benefit students or not it all depends on the situation and what the student wants to do.
