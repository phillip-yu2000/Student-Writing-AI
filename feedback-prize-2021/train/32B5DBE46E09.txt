Dear Principle,

I very well understand the conflict in this situation, but I would like for you to consider the following. Lately the population has become very overwhelmed with problems. Global Warming, violence, starved people/homeless people, and even litter/trash like this situation. However, having the kids be required to pick up trash can make a difference. We can make it fun to change the kids minds, so then they will want to help. Have the kids choose a litter group from 4-6 people and choose a team name, and all through out the year each day will have a different litter group on duty. Only one hour a day! I also very well understand that the kids have other priorities on there schedule, that's okay! Having the litter plan for a different group to go every day can fix that. We have an extensive amount of students at this school, therefore lots of trash too. It will take many to make a difference, and i know we can do it. Doing the right thing in this situation may not change the world, but it *will* make a big difference. Maybe when outsiders see the whole school participating they'll want to dig in too! This earth needs our help, and by doing the work we can! Thank you for taking me into consideration.

Sincerely,

your green helper
