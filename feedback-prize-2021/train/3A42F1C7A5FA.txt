The Mona Lisa Smile is a intresting article about this new upcoming production of technology. It says that in the future they could have students computers have a facial reconzation deviece in it to tell what mood there in to adjust the to whatever there feeling. I feel as if it is not needed for it to be in a learning enviroment. I think its inpratical and would be very expensive for the school to have. That could cause multiple problems just with that problem alone. What if the student wasn't even paying attention to the lesson and it causes it to register there mood but there mood isnt based off the lesson because there not paying attention so it would be invaild infomation. He states in the article it can only find out a couple emotions and boredom isnt one of them. It also poses a security threat to the students or surrounding family because if it can see faces what else would it see or even not mean to capture but does. Over all I just don't see this fit for a students use and would be to expensive anyways. It could work in a perfect world though but we don't have one of those.
