dear, principle performing community service is a good idea but you also need time to study. Does this mean that we will get out of class or will we do community service after school is out? The problem with getting out of class is that we need as much time as we possibly can have to learn. For instance if we end up skipping class to help with community service then we will end up falling behind and going to school latter into our summer break. We could also end up failing because of not learning enough or studying too little. If we help with community service out of school then we would be able to help more, the only thing is that if we have homework then we would have to choose between homework and community service. Most would probably choose not doing their homework . Then when we would go to turn in our homework the students grade would go down and they could fail.

Therefore I think we should not participate in community service unless its on our own time.

sincerely student of this school
