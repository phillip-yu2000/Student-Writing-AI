Dear Principal,

I would possibly prefer Policy 2 because if you would let students use their cellular devices or just cell phones they would think that if you would let them use them during their free time they would use it during the class time too. The students really don't care what class or free time the get to do it depends on how they want to do it. Students would rather want to get in trouble than following the rules at school.

Students also think its okay to text during class as long as the teacher doesn't see it or if another student sees it but does not tell on the person who is doing the wrong in the situation. I fairly think that it is fair to set down the law and start taking students cell phones away instead of giving them more and more warnings. If you do that they are not going to learn and they wont get the punishments that they are supposed to get right away. This is why you should enforce Policy number 2 so the students will learn what they are doing is wrong.

Sincerely,
