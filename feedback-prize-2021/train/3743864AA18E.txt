Mars..... the red planet. We call it many things, some of us people beleive that there is and once was life on the planet mars. But now NASA has discovered something far from anything we've seen before.

The face of on the stone may possibly be weather created by its own planet. In the artical it states, " What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa." Which this means the face looked like landforms juist like on earth, that are found in the American west.

In paragraph 11 a man states about the "rule of the thumb" which tells us about how you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. this explains to us that if the face was real there shouldve been other things to see around it.

Lastly in paragraph 7 the artical says in April 1998, they sent Cydonia over to mars too take pictures and there was no cloudy weather it was perfectly fine, and it took photos of the face. People at home were waiting for the picture to be released, just to find that it was a natural landform.

People can beleive that this is a real face however, they are wrong becauase that the pictue that was taken by cydonia looks just like a normal, natural landform and also the image they had, if they would've zoomed in on it 3 times they should've seen oher things. They also say that the face just looks like a mesa just like in the west of America.

You should beleive that this is nothing but just a nrmal landform caused by the red planets natural enviorment.
