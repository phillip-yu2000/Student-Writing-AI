Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I extremely disagree with those schools that are offering distance learning for students because students wouldn't be benefit from attended classes from home the students just will be worth probably, they would like to take online classes but then they wouldn't attend they might be sleep, and they wouldn't care about the online classes.

The several schools that are offering online or video conferencing classes to students, those schools are doing that in the worse way, because those schools that are offering online classes just would make the students more lazy to attend to school and to receive classes with the teachers at schools, but I believe that students better attend to school than to receive online classes because attending to school the students get an opportunity to know others students and make new friends, and being at home receiving the online classes students don't get the opportunity to know, and meet new people from the same age as them so that's why I believe that those schools that are offering the distance learning to students to receive online classes are doing in a bad path.

Although some say that students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is much better, because students don't has to attend to school and receive the classes with teachers, actually students shouldn't attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldn't learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesn't have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes.

Some say that students should attend to online classes or video conferencing. One reason, school offer that option because they don't want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesn't work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldn't have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school.

I extremely believe the opposite, students shouldn't attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesn't have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesn't have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so those students has to attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, that's one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit.

In conclusion,

however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldn't attend to the distance learning, because that wouldn't be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they wouldn't learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach.

I disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldn't be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them. Many students will prefer to take the distance learning just because they don't want to wake up early and go to school.
