Dear Principal,

My take on whether students should do community service is that they should do it but when they have time. I know helping the community is very important and that it should be supported ,but people are have things to do on their own time. They should decide to do it on their won time because we have to think about them not only on community service. Like helping out in a shelter, people have their own opinion on what they should do, and my take on this is that people can decide on themselves. Helping out on the community is also important because we don't know if there are things to do when they need it most. Some people wouldn't mind helping charities, helping out at a local library, or even helping out the neighborhood and help pick trash. On the other hand, there are some people that are not even interested in community service that don't care if the trash doesn't be picked up or even at least help the community in another way. We are people that think best for ourselves and for others. I know a principal like you would love to help the community out and I cherish that , but people are people and they will think what's best for them and best for their surroundings. I think that all of this is important and we should all take part in this.

Sincerely,
