The author suggest that studying Venus is worthy because it use to be just like earth and thers alot of things we still need to discover because it could be habbitable for humans to lie on it later in life and if with the right tecnology we could explore and learn about the planet more.

In paragraph 4 the text states "if our sister planet is so inhositable why are scientists even discusiing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some Earth like features that are analogeous to those on Earth. Also in paragraph 5 the text states " Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but surviable for humans.

thisa rpoves that venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
