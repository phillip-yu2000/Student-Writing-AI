Dear Principal,

Hello,

my name is STUDENT_NAME. I feel that students should have the right to play school sports with a B average because many students play around and you think they might not understand school work just because everyday you see them playing in the halls, skipping class and everything else that's not recommend in school. Now all of a sudden when its time for sports you see them and say you don't belong here but, when you check their grades your wondering like wow this student never in my class but they always find some way to get their work into me somehow. See what I'm trying to say is from my point of view that everybody deserves a chance to play sports but, I get what your saying, if the student doesn't get at least a B in a class they should not be able to participate in some school activities. I'm trying to state that students should not be able to participate in school activities with a C average because that shows that the child try's to do their best but they need to work a little harder when your trying to participate in school activities. So if the students doesn't have at least a B average they need to try harder and do better next year. That for some students to learn a lesson that you always don't get your way. Also, some students might not understand that that's the way the school rules are hopefully their try to be better at their goals. My point of view I'm trying to explain it the best way I can, I totally agree with you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
