I believe that policy one is the best policy for our school, because what if you have an emergency during lunch or your free time and someone is trying to get a hold of you? What would you do? Or what can you do? It would be kind of hard to keep in touch with someone that can't have cell phone during lunch or any other free time. Think of it this way: If you wanted to ride your friends bus home, but the school doesn't have your mom ,that is at work, cell phone number, and all your other family members live in a different state, and Dad lives somewhere in New York. You have the number in your phone and you ask them if you can pull your phone out to look for the number, but they won't let you pull out your cell phone because of school policy. then you have to wait until after school and you still have to ride your own bus, when you other plans. I don't know about you but that would make me really mad.

What if you were at lunch and you were looking for your friends to sit with, but you can't pull out your phone to ask where in the world they are. You would get detention for texting on school grounds and you would probably have to sit in either silent lunch, with somebody that doesn't like you and always talks about you, and worse of all, sitting with a nerd. I would hate eat at silent lunch for a whole week, and probably boycott school lunches.

Do you see now? live without cell phones would be terrible. There would be no facebook slang, so then you'd have to write everything out. This is what the no cell phone policy would do to you.
