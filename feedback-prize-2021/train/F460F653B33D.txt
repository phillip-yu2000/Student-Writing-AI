As a Seagoing Cowboy I got to travel and see many different places. I got to see Europe and China. I even got to see the Acropolis in Greece! I also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. I even got to tour an excavated castle in Crete, and I had the oppurtunity to marvel the Panama Canal on my way to China. The sights were amazing!

I loved caring for the animals. It kept me busy during the crossings. They all had to be fed and watered three times a day. My job also required me to drag the bales of hay and the bags of oats up from the lower holds. I also had to clean the stalls, which isn't as bad as it sounds. I loved taking care of the animals.

You must beware though of what the dangers are of being a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I was making my hourly report to the captain when I slid down a slippery ladder. My heart began to race as I looked down and saw the dark blue sea. I was only saved by a small strip of metal. I would have flown overboard! I mean what would you expect when you are out at see.

You shoud become a Seagoing Cowboy. There may be dangers, but there is also great fun. You could go to places you have always wanted to go and see things you have always wanted to see. You would probably also love forming a bond and taking care of the animals. It is an amazing way to help people to recover after this terrible tragedy that destroyed everything they owned.
