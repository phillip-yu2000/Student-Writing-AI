My fellow citizens we want people to limiting car usage or get raid of problems with cars for couple of reason. First reason is people rather walk instead of dealing with cars because of getting your excrise. Second reason is pollution. Last reason is making greenhouse gas. All this is solution to our problems in life. We will like to take care the people and the Earth to keep it in shape and clean.

Some people think it more relaxing to not deal with cars they instead they walk like the people in Vauban, Germany residents from there have given up their cars. In the streets of Vauban are completely ''car-free'' and street parking, driveways and home garages are forbidden in Freiburg. 70% of Vauban's families do not ow cars and 57% sold a car to move over there. at this new approach sores are paced a walk away on a main street rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Pollution is one of the most problem that we have and want people to limiting car usage. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Mororists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave cars at home or suffer a 2 22-euro fine $31 same applyed to odd-numbered plates in diffent day of the week. Almost 4000 were fined. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed from France. Diesel make up 67% of vehicles in France, 53.3 % average of diesel engines in the rest of Westen Europe. We are trying to put greenhouse gas out in the world to make it less polluted in the world.

We are trying to make the wrold a better cleaner places for our future.
