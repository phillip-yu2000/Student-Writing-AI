Letter to the principal about change the school policy and my thoughts about changing the policy and some ideas that will happen if they change the policy

The principal should not change the policy. Of the school because the students. could not play there favorite sport. in less they have b average and it would be fear to the students that do ever good in school.

So i think that the principal should not change the policy and that the students that do good in school. They can have a chance to play all the sports that they what to do in school. And also have a lot of fun with there friends. And in joy there friends at school and sport actives after school. And that is why the principal should not change the policy about grades to play the sports at school.

That is my thoughts that they should not change the policy at school and kept it the same way that it was before. And the students can play sports with the grade that they have.
