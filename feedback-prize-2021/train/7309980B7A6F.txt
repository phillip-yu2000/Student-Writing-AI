Dear Principle

I do not agree that it is fair that students are not allow to participate in any sports or school activities unless the student have a B average. One reason is because lots of students love sports. Some people want to go to college to play sports and be able to go to the pros. If you don't give us the chance to learn and play and have fun in high school , then some of us are not going to play any sports.

Another reason why you shouldn't take our fun away because of our C average is because students love to join clubs and go on field trips and help out offices and ad for other teachers and lots of other stuff.

Now if you take all that away just because of our C average than this school will be so boring and students will start switching schools and the school will be known as the worst school in the U.S all because our principal decided to take our sports and activities away.

My final reason on why you shouldn't take our sports away or our activities is because a C average is not failing . A C average is passing . Now I see if students that really wanted to join in activities and play sports had a D or an F average then ill be like "yeah, we don't need our sports or our activities because our grade is low and we re not passing , so we need to focus on our grade" but students have a C average and a C average is passing and I believe students will work hard to get that C average up and still have a chance to play sports or/and join activities.
