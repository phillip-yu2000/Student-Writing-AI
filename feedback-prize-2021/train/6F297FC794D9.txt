Dear Principal,

Community service is important for children to take part in I believe it should be a requirement for school. Helping out the community does take time away from what they need or want but in the real world you have to give time up for others. Community service is great way for kids at this school to grow. This task of helping will make them more giving and willing to help out , which is a great characteristic for a child to have. Simple tasks of service will help them be more responsible. They will have less time to finish what they need to, but it will have the children buckle down and be more efficient and responsible when it comes to time management. Community service also gets kids involved with their own community and have opportunities to help out and make the community a better place. By getting involved they are helping out the community and their self .Also it'll change the out look that many kids have about the community and they will have a better understanding of how a community functions and its problems. Community service does no harm it only helps the person participating in it . Simple services like cleaning up litter can make the community a much cleaner nice place to be in. That simple task will also teach the volunteer recycling methods and teach them how to treat things with respect. I believe community service should be a requirement it helps teach kids to be more responsible , giving, and caring. Children should have those qualities in their character and community service is a way they can explore the community and be a better person.

Sincerely ,
