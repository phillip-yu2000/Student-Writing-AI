i think you shouldn't let students that only have a B as an average just incase you haven't notice 78% of the students who play sports have a C

average those are the people who are really good at sports for example all the boys in the volleyball team have a C average and they have never lost a game. know i am not saying the C has to be a lowC going to a D because that is not acceptable they should have a C going to a B that is if you want to keep SCHOOL_NAME sports reputation or another idea is to make the 78% that have C go to tutoring so they can improve there school average the students may also have a better positive attitude in school because if understand what the teacher is teaching they will be focus on the teacher paying much attention to their teacher instead of talking to there friends and what does that mean that they can improve there average and if they don't go up to a high C or a B that means its time to take them of the team until there grades go up
