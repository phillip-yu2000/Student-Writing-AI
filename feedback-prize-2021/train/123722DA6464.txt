Community Service

I think that it is a good thing to do community service because it gives our planet a cleaner look when tourist come and visit are city and or state. So i think yes everyone should do at the least a little community service and then you will still have time to hang out with your friends or do homework or read a book. If you do community service it might make you feel better and make you want to clean up more. So that our city/state looks clean and feels like the people who live in it really care about where they live. Doing community service may not seem fun but if you get all your friends together then you could make it fun and want to do it more so i think that you shouldn't be required to do it but you should help out our city/state every once in a while because you do live here so why not help out a little. like say if your not doing anything like your just sitting on the couch then you should go out and do community service because your not doing anything anyway. That's what i think about community service.
