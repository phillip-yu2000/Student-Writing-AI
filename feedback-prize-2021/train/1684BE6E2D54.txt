Many people can be in different situations. They can use trusted adults for opinions so they can make the best decision. Getting advice from different people can help a lot. For example, they can talk to their parents, guardians, friends, trusted adults, or even people you don't know!

First of all, if a student wasn't at school for a couple of days and his or her friend was. The student can ask his or her friend for advice on what they missed or how to do the homework so they can make it up. The student may ask multiple people so he or she can get the best result. The student may be able to help other students that were also not at school on that day.

Second, people on the streets could help too. If a person went on a trip to Hawaii and got lost, he or she can ask different people about the directions to their destination. He or she can ask, "How do I get there?" or "What is the fastest route?" They can put those answers together and get to their final destination easy and fast.

Third, if someone is playing video games with their friend and doesn't know how to complete a challenge. They can ask their friend and the friend can help complete the challenge. He can give different way to do it or the easiest way to do it. After all the help he got from his friend, he could share with his other friends, and it would just keep on going until everyone knows.

Last but not least, if someone went to the store to get groceries and wants the best price, he or she can ask the people who work there or other people at the store. They can also go to different stores and compare prices. They would not have everyone'sÂ opinions and can get the item they want at the best prices.

This is how asking multiple people for advice can help you. The advice that has been learned can be passed on to other people so they can learn too. This is also a great way of communication!
