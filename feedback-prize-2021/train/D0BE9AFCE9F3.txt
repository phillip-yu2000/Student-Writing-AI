Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Many people believe it is appropriate to take care of our community.

Whether it is helping someone in need, or picking up a couple of cans off the side of the road.

Although some people think that this is a great opportunity to make our community a better place, some people find it as being a waste of time.

They don't see the importance of community service.

I find it very important to help out in my community.

Every little gesture of kindness is great!

In my opinion, the people who don't want to help out, are selfish.

They would rather spend time benefiting themselves than to benefit others.

It is also a sign of laziness.

What people don't understand, is that helping out in our community is fun, and if its the right kind of job, it will earn you credits if you are in Honors Society!

If you are not in honors society, it just might be on a college application!

Having community service on there might get recognized when it comes to finding a job these days.

So TEACHER_NAME, I think you should require all students to perform community service.

It could be a great way to help our children in school(if they are tutoring), making our community look nicer(by planting flowers, trees, etc.), and to teach them respect for their community.

This could be beneficial to everyone here in Brunswick County.

But why stop there?

Spread the word!

We could tell our friends in South Carolina to make their community a better place!

If we keep this going, our world will be a better place for everyone to live in!

Thank you,

Student at SCHOOL_NAME
