Dear senator, the way we elect this countries president is flawed and un-effective. We technically don't directly vote for the president, we vote for some person who then chooses the president. Since this contry is democratic it think that the popular vote is definitly the way to elect the future presidents.

To start off,the electoral college isnt fair to voters because candidates only go to states where they know they will get the vote. In the article "The indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the systemare wrong" it says "The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance at winning". People vote for the person who they want to be in office not for someone who might vote for the person who you want. I guess you could say voters in swing states are going to know more about the election. But you never know that does not always happen.

Secondly the eclectors could be anyone and could be chosen by anybody,there are no kind of qualifications. On the other hand the regular voters actuaully have to meet some sort of standards like you aren't allowed to vote if you have commited some sort of crime a certain amount times. And most of the time the American people dont see adds or commercials about the electorates. Howdo we know we can trust these random people with our vote? In my eyes and probably most peoples eyes, see this system as a non-democratic way to vote for our president.

To conclude our country should switch to the popular vote system strictly because the elctoral college is an unfair, un-democratic way of choosing our nations future leader.
