Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think policy # one is the best because cell phones are not a bad thing as long as they are not used during class. If they are on during class then teachers can take them away. There are a lot of good reasons cell phones. I have three reasons for my choice

1. One of the most important are if someone gets hurt and there are no phones around you then you can pull out your cell phone and call 911 and safety is on its way.

2. If there is a family emergency and one of your family members are trying to get a hold of you then the can.

3. You can also talk to people that way if one student is on one side of the building and your on the far end of the school then you can call them instead of running down the hall trying to talk to that person trying to not be late for class if we did not have cell phones we would be doing that.

TEACHER_NAME i hope you are convinced that policy 1 is the best choice. If you choose policy 2 would not be able to have any of these advantages.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
