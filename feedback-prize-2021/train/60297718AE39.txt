I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars because one day you may be driving and your car is driverless but it is an on coming car coming toward you and you don't have control of the car and the car might not sense when another car is coming toward it and it may and can cause a wreck. Others may agree to have driverless cars but I don't think it is a good idea to have driverless cars it may be safe to other but it is not safe to me because I wouldn't want to have a wreck driving in a driverless car. It is good to have motion sensored cameras on the back and front of some vehicles but it is not good to have a car that parks itself because you could maybe put the car in to driverless mode it may cause a wreck or crash while the car is parking or driving on it's own. it is not good to have antilock brakes either bc you could be on your way to work and your coming to a yellow light that is turning red you may not be paying attention and not have your seatbelt on and the car just brakes on it's own it could cause serious and major injuries to you or anyone else who may be in the car with you.
