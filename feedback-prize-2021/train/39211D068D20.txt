Dear Principal,

I do believe that community service is good, especially for young people. It gives them a sense of responsibility, helps them feel better about themselves, and serves the community at the same time. However, I do not believe that it should be required. Some kids already have too much on their plates, with things such as violin, dance, taking care of younger siblings, chores, and more.

Besides, once you start forcing kids to do community service, it loses some of its meaning. If people are doing it for selfish reasons, then it's just not as sincere. Senior citizens would much rather be helped by nice kids than reluctant teenagers.

Of course, kids who do community service often have better chances of getting into better schools. So I believe that community service should stay an optional activity, because if a kid wants to look good on their resume, then they'll have to work extra hard for it. If every teen has community service on their record, then it's just not the same. People who work harder than others deserve to get rewarded.

Let's be honest, community service isn't every kids' thing. Sometimes, teenagers are really bad at community service. It's better to let them do their own thing than force them to terrorize elementary school kids. Some teens are better at participating at other things, such as drama club, science fairs, or more. We shouldn't force kids at this age to be more helpful, or charitable, because let me tell you, it most likely won't work.

So while I'm in the opinion that community service is a great thing, it should not be abused. Some kids have many reasons not to be able to do community service. It doesn't mean they're heartless monsters, it just means they're busy. Trust me, the kids who actually want to do community service will find a way to do it. My friends are a shining example of that. You don't need to force us to do it, a lot of us will do it on our own. Please have more faith in us.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
