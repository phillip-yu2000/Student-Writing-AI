No, some people eill grt caught with doing other stuff like like playing the game system , being the the phome stuff like that . another reason why some students shouldn't attend classes from home is cause some have a hard time learning or will get confused and will just give up. Also, people wouldn't take arrending school from home serious becuase they will want to hang out with they friends and go smoke and just forget about they work.

I don't agree with this prompt because it will be a bad idea for students to attend school from home cause they can get side tracked or lose foucus from what they doing. students also can not know what they doing and will give up and just stop it. I think some students will need someone at they house like a canceller for to help them out for they wouldn't have a break down.

I also feel like some students would need help with what they doing and not all students shouldn't asttend home school.

home schhol isn't for everyone people also have work andc when they get off they people tired and will not do the work..

They shouldn't let students attend school from home becuase we not learning anything.Â
