Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school. I think it's best for students to bring cell phones to school, because anything could happen while their at school. Some one might break into the school, a fire could break out, or a student may have forgotten something at home and need to call their parents to get it for them and take it to school. You never know if a teacher has his/her phone or not. What if that teacher didn't. It is better off for a student to have their own phone. Students should use their phone only for safety reasons though.

I agree that cell phones should not be used during class, because it can cause distraction for their classmates, and disturb other people from doing their work and the teachers from teaching. It can also cause a distraction to you and can make your grades go down. I think it is not a good thing to have cell phones in class. But that doesn't mean I don't think students should have cell phones at school at all, but only on their free times.
