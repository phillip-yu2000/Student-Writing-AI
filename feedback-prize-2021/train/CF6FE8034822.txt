To the Principal:

I am for policy 1, because of many reasons. Policy 1 does state that cell phones can be used during free-time and lunch periods, cell phones are a handy when you need to communicate with someone, and cell phones are really handy incase of an emergency.

This policy does state that cell phones are only to be used during lunch times and free periods.

Our lunch time is not during class time, meaning this policy does not interrupt teachers or distract us from our education. After all, cell phones are supposed to be turned off in class; so we can't use them to cheat, or be distracted by them.

Cell phones are really handy when you need them to contact someone.

Like if you leave something at home(like a project or a homework assignment), you can call a parent during free-time and tell them to bring it.

You can also like call someone if you need tutoring, or if you just need something from a friend, like notes or the homework from a certain class.

Cell phones are also handy during an emergency.

Like if something were to go down at the school(like a fire, a lockdown, or an earthquake), you'd be able to tell your parents that you're okay and nothing happened to you.

Also, like if you're feeling sick, you can call your parents during free time and tell your parents that you need them to pick you up.

Again, I am for policy 1, because of many reasons. Policy 1 does state that cell phones can be used during free-time and lunch periods, cell phones are a handy when you need to communicate with someone, and cell phones are really handy incase of an emergency.
