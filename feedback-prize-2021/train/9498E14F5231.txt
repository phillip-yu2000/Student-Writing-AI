Dear principal

First able i would like to know how you're doing, i hope you're doing well. I have been informed about a new policy in our school. This new policy will require for all student to have at least a grade B average to be able to participate in any sports or other school activities.

I consider this idea to be reasonable. I am pleased that you would actually consider this. I am in total favor of this new policy.

This may be the start of a perfect end to bad grades and behavior.

Students will start taking school more seriously knowing that there is a reward for them if they do so.

Although I support your decision, there is something that is bothering me a little. I think that for those students with a C average is not fair to not be able to enroll in any school activity. In my opinion a C average is not bad.

My suggestion is the following: Students with an A or B average will definitely be allowed to participate in any kind of school activity.

Students with a C average will be allowed to perform certain activities but not all. If they show improvement then they will be free to enjoy any activity they like.

I would like to thank you for your time. I hope that you consider my suggestion and realise the advantages and disadvantages. The fact that you want to pass this new school regulation proves that you are a caring principal that wants the best for her students. Please take care and thank you again.

Sincerely....
