I belive that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that it is valuable because you can tell what a student is going through and how they really feel even if they are trying to hide it.

In the article it states that "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" this could help teachers out a lot. If the computer can show that many students are bored or confused the teacher can see the results and help the students undersatnd more or just change the lesson plan and spend more time actually trying to help the studens instead of just making them understand something that they dont know how to do.

It could also tell you if the students is going through a hard time in their life at the time. The author states in the article "the software can even identify mixed emotions" so if a student gets scanned on the computer and it shows they are sad you can ask them if they want to talk about anything, or you can just be there for them to make sure that they are ok, and they they get through whatever is going on safely and not by themselves. In conclusion thi is why i belive that this technology to read emotional expressions of student in a classroom is valuable.
