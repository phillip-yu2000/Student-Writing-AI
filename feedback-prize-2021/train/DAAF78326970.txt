Twenty-five years ago the JPL took the first photograph of the Face on Mars. The face on Mars is actually a naturally occuring land formation. Several photographs of the face have been taken over the last 27 years. The photographs were all taken by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Labratory (JPL).

The face on Mars was not created by aliens. Although it may look that way, the face is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The same landforms are common around the American West. In Cydonia, the area where the photographs were taken, butte's and mesa's are common. The Martian mesa has wierd shadowing on the top which, caused it to look like a face. If the Face on Mars was created by aliens it would be easy to tell, because "Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters."The refore making the image incredibly clear and making it easier for analyst to identify what the face actually is.

Even if it was created by aien lifeforms hundreds of years ago, Nasa would not keep this a secret from the world. Because it would benefit them. And also if it was created by alien lifeforms and Nasa wanted to keep it a secret, why would they release the image in the first place. Therefore the Face on Mars is a naturally occuring land formation
