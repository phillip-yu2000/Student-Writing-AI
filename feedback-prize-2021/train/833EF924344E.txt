I think that students should not participate in sports only if they do not have a B average in their classes they take. Only because that's not fair to the people that have B average grades and they work hard in school so they can play the sport that they want or love to do. And to the people who want to play in soccer or volleyball that have a C average grade should not do any activities to show them that they need to work hard in school to get what they deserve.

So lets say if you wanted to play soccer and so did I but you were a student that had a C average grade then me as a friend would tell you to get your act together and get not a B average grade but an A+ grade. So I think this is a lesson to most student if you want something that you can't have then get your act together and fight for what you want which is good grades to play whatever you want to play or do.

So in other words I would have agree with the principal. Only because I believe you have to fight for what you want especially in high school. There really strict about having good grades to do any other activities including sports. But if you wanted to do extra work to get to the B or A average grade then do it, it's worth the A or B to do what you want to do. To show you that you actually can do it.
