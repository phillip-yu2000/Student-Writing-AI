Dear Participants Thinking About Joining TheSeagoing Cowboys,

Well, hello. My name is Luke Bomberger, a participant onboard the SS Charles W. Wooeter. If you're reading this letter, then that means that you're thinking about joining the Cowboys. This can be a great oppertunity to go explore the big bright beautiful world,

but know this. You're not just going to go sighteeing. Your going to help people in europe and China happier. Now let us begin with the best parts of the trip.

The first thing that you need to know about our little band of participants is that we all have eachother's backs. We help eachother with our jobs and have fun together. All that we do is help our cargo (horses) get to our destination saftly. These horses are supposed to be feed and watered three times a day. We have all the oats and water we need tokeep th horses alive. Don't thionk that all that we do is deliver and feed horses. After the horses are loaded up onto the destination then we all get to ave fun. We have table tennis tournaments, paly volleyball, and much more.

That's all tht I have for you right now. If you want to learn more about this bnd of participants, come and find us and jion us. We aren't just looking for men, we are looking for wemen too. Just find us, sign up, and have fun. I hope to see you there.

Your friend,

Luke Bomberger
