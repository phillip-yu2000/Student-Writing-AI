Technology to read emotional expression of students in the classroom is valuable? Is technology in classrom good for students for teacher can read there emotions. I think it would be good to hvae them in classrooms. Teachers should have them so they can read studets emotions. Here are my three reasons why teachers hsould have technology to read emotional expressions.

If the students like the teacher or any other students. If the teacher uses the technology on the students she can tell rather or not if the students likes her. If the students dont like the teacher can at least try to make that student like her. The teacher can tell if the student is going to give the teacher a bdad time by the teacher emotions.

I mean thats good to know because the teacher can know what student going to give her a bad time.

The students are in a bad mood or something or they getting bullied by a classmate. The teacher can know by using that technology on the student. If the student is in a bad mood the teacher can sit down with that students and talk to what student bully him. I think the teacher would find out more which students would catch the bullys. I think that technology would be grate for a school.

I think it could help the teachers know if the students would get that material. Like if they dont get it the teacher can use that technology and know if that student dont get. The teachers would ask that student if the students lie the teacher can use the technology. I think that would be great the teacher can help the student more.

Those are my reasons why technology of emotional expression should be in the classroom. Those are my three reasons why.
