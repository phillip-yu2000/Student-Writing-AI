driverless cars are dangerous and pointless. the car is suppose to be ment for the driver not to use the instruments in the car right? so why do the driver have to be alerted to still grab the weel every once in a while to drive. there is no point in making an computerized vehical when humans have been drinving cars themselfs for decades now, why try to change it up now.

another reason why we should not have computerized cars is computers take up our whole world now already for instance: our credit cars, our taxes, most jobs are using technogly,our cell phones, when we go to colledge, libraries, jobs mostly obtain computers too. so it shows that we cannot have nothing to ourselfs everything is based on technogly, nothing is on hand made or hand worked anymore. so why should we let the govnerment take over our cars as well ? so the computers are going to be rulers of our world forever for everything.? i dont think so.

i think it is very pointless and stupid to spend so much time and so much money on unneeded materials. they should be spending money on more important tasks. such as like medical insurances. housing agencys,(ect) i dont think they should put so much time and so much money into something that is not even secure enough.

my last reason concludes why there should not be driverless cars because, what if the driver gets shot or passes out and is not aware of the car alert to assist the driving? then the car will crash and it will be a total wreck. so ther's no point in creating a car that is not even all the way reliable. the car is not one hundred percent secure and can fall out of sorts.

in conclusion i feel ther should not be any driverless cars created any time soon or ever .
