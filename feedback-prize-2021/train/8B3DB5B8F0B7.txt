I think seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because not all people have the same ideas and they can give them different advise because we all think different. Me personally I think this is really good because their were time where i just asked one person for advise and it did not go well and when i asked multiple people it went good and i have a lot of examples that have gone well and bad.

One time I needed help with something personal and I asked 4 of my good friend for advise and they all told me different things but I try to put everything they told me into one idea and try to do it and I did and it went really well and I think if I did not ask more than one person it would have gone well because of the other persons feelings.

Other time I needed help with my math homework and instead of asking multiple people for help i\I only asked for one persons help and I think that was not a great idea because not all people will get what your trying to figure out. I only asked one person for help so it did not go well because i should've asked other person to because everyone works differently and they can get different answers.

So I just think its good if you ask multiple people for help or advise people,who knows if there right or wrong or if its good or bad advise because from my experience its better for you to ask multiple people.
