To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to tell you some reasons not to change the grade requirements for after school sports and activities. The students want to be able to participate in sports and activities because it lets them be free and cope with problems they might have at the time. They might have problems running or jumping so they join the soccer team to help with running. The students could also be trying very hard to get a C but barely make it. If you change the requirements for after school activities then they wont be able to participate because they can barely make a C. Many students would not be able to participate with the activities because of their grades so the people directing the activities might loose their job because of the lack of participating students. If you change the requirements for participating in after school activities then you wont only be hurting the students but the people that run the activities too.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME

8th grade
