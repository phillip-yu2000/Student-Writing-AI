CR Driving & Texting!

I strongly agree that phones should be banned while driving because of all the accidents they are causing. These are causing insurance to rise and causing scare to people's health. Studies have proven that drivers who use phones while driving are more responsible for the cause of an accident. Driving is dangerous technique and to safely execute driving you should be 100% focused, but if you are drunk or on your phone, you are potentially in danger to yourself and others on the road. As a society, we have become very less mindful of everything going on around us and do not take much precaution of things happening right in front of us.

Many people think distractions while driving is only texting and driving but in fact, while driving, sometimes it is easy to lose focus on the road because you are on the phone or because so much could be happening around you, but this means you forget you are on the road with others, instead of by yourself. Research has it, " The available studies so far suggest that talking on the phone while driving, even hands-free, is as bad or worse than driving drunk. ... A test of 41 adults found that driving while intoxicated was actually less dangerous than driving while talking on a hand-held phone or a hands-free phone."
