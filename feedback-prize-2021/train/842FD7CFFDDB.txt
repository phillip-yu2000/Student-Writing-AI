I think that if a student has a B average that they shouldn't be able to participate in sports because to some students, sports and school are just too much for them.

When students are trying to have good grades in school and be in sports at the same time, it gets too hard for them and their grades drop lower. If a student that want to play sports but has bad grades, they should work hard to get into the sports that they want to be in. They shouldn't just barely pass and be able to be in sports. Some kids work hard to get into sports, and when someone that just barely passed gets into sports, it makes the other kids mad because they worked so hard to get where they were.

Some kids think it's unfair that they couldn't get into sports because of their grades. They have to improve their grades to get what they want. And if they don't want to, then they shouldn't be allowed in sports.

So I think that students should work hard for what they want. I think it's only fair that students with an A average should have a choice to be in sports or not.
