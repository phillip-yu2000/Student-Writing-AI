The summer projects should be student-designed based to make sure the student has a higher chance of doing it then not. In the summer students wouldnt care about summer assignments and would just not do them just because they dont want to or just completely forget about it. If the student choose their own idea for the projects it's likely they'll do it and not just leave it somewhere to be forgotten.

The projects that the students can choose their own idea is more fitting to them as if having a teacher make a topic that is confusing ,to part of the class but the rest of them understands. At this time too this is a chance to see if what they learned during the school year stayed with them over the summer and shown in their project. When the student does their own idea for the project it pushes him/her to complete it, to use the information he/she learned and put it with their own idea. An example is being given an assignment that you hardly understand and the topic is difficult to write about the student will ask for help and once they go home it will be forgotten. Sometimes when its the students own idea to the projects it gives them a littleÂ encouragement to see it finished and there will be no excuse on not understanding the topic because it was the students own.

The position of projects being students-designed is the better option it lets us know where their going for in a curtain area where they get off topic in their own topic and shows what they can write or do in the teachers terms. This way we can see where the troubles are even though we could do the same on teacher-designed projects on the student based ones the students will get use to writing their own paper instead of someone else's.
