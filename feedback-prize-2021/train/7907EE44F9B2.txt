Letting students use there cell phones during lunch period,

or other free times is a noble idea. Because some students would much whether use there cell phones then sit at lunch and have nothing to do, talking to the same people over and over again does get a little over baring it happens all the time to myself!.

Social life today is very important to a lot of teenager's, so the thought of you letting us use our phones broad-minded. The only problem i would think there is to be, someone who forgets to cut off the cell-

phone and the sound will go off while the teacher is giving a lesson to the students, which is going to make the teacher highly upset making the teacher come to you and complain about the new rule.

If you do let us use our cell-phones there should be a time during the lunch period that we have to shut off all ringers to make sure nothing can or will go off .

Hopefully you will pass the rule of letting us use or phone, and everything goes well!.
