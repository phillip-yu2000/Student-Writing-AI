I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students can focus more without having alot of people around them. Students can learn more online than they can on papper, students would beable to be confortable learing online at home without getting up early.

Students learing online at home can make things alot easy because students can focus more without alot of kids being around. Focusing is a big thing when your doing school work. When doing school work you have to make sure you have good grades. Since you are at home doing work online you dont have to worry about much except checking your grades online.

some students are really shy and nerves about there handwritting. People may not want others to see there handwrittting because people can make front of them. A good way to to fix that is doing school work online.

Learing online at home can be helpful for the ones that have trouple sleeping at night . when you have you wake up all you would have to do is eat and get conftorble to learn students should be able to attend classes online because it is alot easyer for some people. Some people have trouple sleeping at night and alot of students are really shy and dont like going out in plublic and learing. Students can learn alot more online at home because they feel more confortble.
