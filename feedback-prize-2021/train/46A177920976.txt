Dear Principal,

I know it seems like a good idea for students to have at least a B average to participate in school activities, but it may be hard for some students to maintain a B average. As you know every students learning abilities are different and it may be easier for some than others. I'm in band and I know that sometimes its a little hard to maintain a B during football season as it would be for most any other activity. I would have to say I am against this possible policy change for the following reasons: Some people have harder times in different classes than others, B average is sometimes hard maintain even if you don't play sports or participate in any other activity, Many students have a C average and would be cross that all of a sudden they could not run track or play football or anything else because they have a C and not a B. A lot of people would have stop doing there favorite things because they could only maintain at least a C average. There would also be a lot of people that would take that as a sign and start working harder. This is the reason I think you should keep the expected average for playing sports at C.

Thank you for your time,
