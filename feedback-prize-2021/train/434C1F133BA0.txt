Dear TEACHER_NAME

I love the idea of having community service. Its a great way to get kids up and active. It's also a great way to get the planet cleaned up. I think that everyone should have to do community service not as a punishment but as something they need to do to keep the planet Earth the way it is, without pollution and bad stuff like that.

If we pick up every bit of trash we see, it would cut down on pollution so much and wild life loss. I know people from hooks hunt What happened if the pollution got so bad that it wiped out the race of deer, hogs, anything that we hunt? There are some animals that are already almost all gone because of our trash!

Our trash gets into the ocean killing hundreds of thousands of animals a day. Fish, birds, its even killing us. What ever we put in that ocean comes right back to us and bites us in the tall! If we keep going in the way we are there is no way that animals are going to live with us around.

Some ways that we could cut down on this is recycling. Paper, bottles, plastics. Find somewhere we can put the school trash, take the left over food to a homeless shelter. That would be kind and save the land.

I have only talked about one thing you can do for community service. There is so much more we can do. If we work together we can do anything. I believe that our school can do something about this! No act of kinds, no mater how small, is never wasted!
