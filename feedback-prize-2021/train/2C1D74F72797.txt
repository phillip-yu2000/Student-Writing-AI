Dear Principal,

I think all children should have to do community service because it will help others and I know that once someone does community service it will make them feel good about themselves. The people that they help will also, feel good and thankful. This can make a better community because everyone will want to help out everyone else. There will be more respect for one another. There must be respect, people now are just trying to tolerate others and not respecting them because of how they are by seeing them and not seeing what they are like on the inside. We need to help one another and our environment to make it a better place to live. The respect and community service will help it all change.

Community service also, will help our school by giving it a good reputation, being known for helping our community. It can also, help our school by making it look better because someone may do community service hear and make our school cleaner. Someone can also, do community service hear by painting murals or even touching up some of the paint around the school. This is an excellent idea and do not try and doubt yourself because it can help what happens here.

Everyday can help our community just by doing the little things it takes, no one should not have to miss out on the opportunity on helping out. It helps out our school. It helps out the environment. Finally, it helps out the community. Maybe one day we will have a safe place to live and go to school. Everyday will be a better day, so jump at the opportunity to help everyone and everything. Your in

Sincerely,
