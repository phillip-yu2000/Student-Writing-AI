Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because as dangerous venus might be, Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the plante itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, it has 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets, venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfrud acid in it's atmosphere, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest temparature of any planet in the solar system, it may have been one of the most earth like planets.

Venus has a surface of rocky sediments, valleys, mountains, and crates. To get a better look at venus, NASA's solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. However, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance, for this reason, NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a champer simulation the chaos of Venus's surface.

In the text it says "our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." Therefore we should take a risk for Venus because we never know what we might come across.
