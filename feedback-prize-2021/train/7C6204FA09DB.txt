Driverless cars to me seem like the way to go, in a future sense. Driverless cars may in fact reduce collisions with other cars due to human error, but computer errors can just as likely occur. Driverless cars may take over the market, leaving new drivers a sense of safety and invicibility. Drivers that use driverless cars would not have enough experiance behind the wheel to fix, or take over the car if needed. This would lead inexperianced drivers at the wheel when a difficult situation arises, and may lead to a larger accident.

Google may have a very advanced car, equip with gear that they modified the Toyota Prius but that may not be enough. All of the gear inside may not be able to predict or mimic human operations. When to go, when not to go and when to stop, driverless cars would be almost perfect assuming everyone had one. Purely human operated cars may pose as an obsticle for the driverlesss ones.

I feel as though driverless cars may be the futuristic sci-fi many have desired to see since childhood, but the use for them I cannot find. Cars with drivers should not be replaced, the only use for driverless cars might be handicap individuals who might need to rely on the car to drive for them. Driverless cars are trying to replace something that is not broken, and I am getting a feeling that driverless car manufacturers are trying to reinvent the wheel.
