Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME

and i attend your high school. i believe cell phones should be aloud at school as long as there is no texting during class. students need their cell phones. they help to maintain contact with their families if there emergencies and as an added incentive they get to text their friends. i believe this is ok so long as they do not text during class.

as a student at your school i have been hearing the remarks about the possibility of students not being aloud to have there cell phones at school. these remarks are not good and if you do this it could result in large amounts of rebellion. i think we both know that if that happens the school grounds would be chaotic.

i am a concerned student who also believes cell phones should be aloud at our school. so i ask for the sake of our school please don prohibit cell phone use on school grounds.

sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
