Letter to Principal:

Some of my friends perform community service, but my other friends think it just waste of time. I am supporting that the principal should require students to perform community service. This is a great way to show to the community that you care. Students should know that community service is very important. Community service helps you and your community.

There are many reasons why students should perform community service. Performing community service helps your community and other communities. Your community will be cleaner and fresh. Not just students but everyone in this country should have community service. When your community is full with trash. No one will care, but you can make a change. You will need a helping hand to help you with community service.

In streets, public places, and school campus,

there are people littering. If you care about your community, you should gather people to help you clean it. Even if the trash is not yours, pick it up. It is not just picking up trash. There are planting trees, etc. So, when you are done picking up the trash, you could continue planting trees and flowers. To make it stand out.

In conclusion, everyone should have the pride to carry out community service. Community service is like a helping hand. So every stu
