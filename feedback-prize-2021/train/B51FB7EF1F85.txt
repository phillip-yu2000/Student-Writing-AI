Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a followed student I think of you new Policies. The must dislike policy is the sports policy. That if you get a B or higher that you can participate sports. I a Fellow SCHOOL_NAME Student I think this is policy is a Cutting Chances for the Future sports legends. Also its a cutting chance to get fit and heath. Another one is that if a Relax Time for the students at SCHOOL_NAME. These are some reason that cutting P.E. if not getting good grades.

First off cutting P.E for "Bad" Grades. Is a Bad thing it is cutting those Future legends. Maybe SCHOOL_NAME, is going to have the Aaron Rodgers or Next Babe Ruth. But, if you cut sports to those people who are getting bad grades. Those who ar getting bad grades. Maybe the next Legends or Superstars. The legends are dying if you make that a Perment Policy.

There Students on campus that are over weight or need to stay maintain healthy. This is all Depending on you. Do you want to see you Students become fat or Obesity. It All depends on you. Students take sports to stay fit or become fit.

The Last reason that comes to mind is that the Students that take a sport s it is for Completive and for relax and have fun once in a wiled. Face it there not becoming any younger or Smaller. They want a fun, Before they have to go to work go into more schooling they don't have much time when they are working and Studying or homework. They need this time Exerice and time for Fun.

As a Followed Student at SCHOOL_NAME in Mesa, AZ. That the New Sports Policy is a bad to start think of. The Students of this great School will be very Anger with you as a Principle of this Great Wonderful School. If I was You I would throw that policy in the Trash can and never take it out ever.

From your Followed Student,

STUDENT_NAME
