"I'm tired i dont want to drive home!" what if you didnt need to drive home? You might not need to drive your car anymore. Car companies are making cars smarter and cars would be able to drive themselves. Driverless cars are effiecent because the driver doesnt need to drive all the time, there would be less accidents.

Drives won't need to drive all the time now. There are some people who just dont know how to drive and are better off not driving. In the article it said " The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over." This shows that drivers would still need to drive the car but not all the time. Sometimes drivers need to get somewhere but dont go because they dont want to drive. They won't have to becuase they might drive for a little bit or maybe nothing at all.

There would be less accients if cars can be driven themselves. In the article it said " their cars have been driven more than half a million miles without a crash."

This shows that their cars so far have not gotten into an accient for a while. People who have cars tnd to crash many times because some drivers are just not careful. The roads would be more calm and safe. It is just better for everyone.

Car companies should make driverless are becuase people wont need to drive all the time espicially when thehy go somewhere far, and there would be less car accidents which also include less deaths. No one wants to be involved in an accident. I believe driverless cars would be neccessary and they should have them. Many people would like to have a car they dont need to drive.
