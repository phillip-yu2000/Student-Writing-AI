Distracted Driving

People say that using cell phones while driving is a hazard and that is affects everything you do. I believe that using a cell phone to text or do anything that requires you to look away from the road is hazardous. However, I believe that using your phone to call is not hazardous because you are not focused on the screen, therefore it does not obstruct your view of the road. This is not a bad rule to be able to speak on your phone.

They rate of fatalities in driving incidents have skyrocketed over the years because of cell phones but I believe only looking at your phone causes the accidents. If you were on the phone, on a call, and not looking at your phone then you wouldn't be in as much danger. Stats show that at least nine people are killed every day because of distracted drivers, but it doesn't tell what they were doing on their phones. The distracted driver was most likely looking at their phone, due to texting or social media. If you're talking on your phone and not looking at it then I believe there would be fewer accidents.

In 2015, most teens admitted to texting while driving. When people started to see the dangers of it, using phones while driving slowed down. However, there are still a lot of things that people do that help the cause accidents. The crashes that happen now are made out of ignorance and not caring for what they are doing, but its harming people.

In conclusion the texting while driving scene is bad and we should stop doping it and we should allow phone calls because they are less dangerous and it still allows conversations and work to be done.
