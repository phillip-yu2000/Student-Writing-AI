I think that the author should further his study because of the things that they already predicted used to be on Venus and the things that are now there. They've said that Venus is a sister planet to Earth, so I think that it strongly is possible that there was life and lots of other thing on Venus. If there wasn't life there then they could've had the chance of having life there if Earth were to end.

In the passage it says "The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters". Venus having things like that are the exact reason that Venus should be explored. Getting to Venus might be a tough thing though. This passage also states that "no spacecraft the landing for more than a few hours." So getting to Venus will be one dangeroud yet good trips to take.

While traveling to Venus could be very risky and dangerous imagine the experience you'll get. Traveling to Venus wouldn't be like going to Italy, it's a better chance to see something new. Scientist are actually speaking about visits to the planet in the future, because Venus is closer to the sun it'll be really hot there, so hopefully scientist can figure that out. That could possibly be a huge part of why no spacecraft has yet to land there.

So that people can go and explore Venus, NASA is working on new ways to go and study Venus. They're looking into old technology from World War ll. NASA says that our modern computers are a lot more delicate than computers from back in those times. So basically a mixture of the old technology from the 40's and modern day technology could possibly help us travel to Venus.

I do think that traveling to Venus would be a could be something new for us, we have lots of things to work on of course before setting off to Venus. If there are mountains and valley's and all other things like that, I think that's it's worth giving a shot.
