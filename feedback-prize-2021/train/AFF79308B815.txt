The human face that was founded on mars by NASA's Viking 1 sapcecraft. They believe it was created by aliens,but are aliens real? How can they say it was created by aliens when we dont know that aliens are real. In my opinion it has to be the normal land formation, Mars has a lot of rocks and i know there is a lot of stuff in Mars that look like things in our planet. I do believe that it looks like a human face but Mars has sand storms and gets hit by craters all the time and that may be the reason why there is a face on mars.

As we can see in the pictures in 1976, the face looks better then the other pictures. In 2001, the face is gone because of the snadstorm that they had and covered the face. They have no proof that aliens had something to deal withit. They had no foot prints , no sign of an alien, and It looks like to me that t was created by it self. NASA's has no right to say that the face was created by aliens if they have no sign or proof that it was. They don't have proof that aliens are real. That only leads to one conclusion which is that the face on Mars is a land formation.

Therefore, Is the face on Mars created by aliens or is a land formation? The pivtures explain nothing but that it is a land formation. Why? Their is no evidence that it was created by aliens nor anything else. The only way that it would've been created by aliens if NASA's had proof that there were some type of tracks of aliens. They didn't have anything so it leads to one solution. IT has to be created by sand storms and craters.
