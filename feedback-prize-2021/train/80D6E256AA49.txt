Landform or alien? The face on Mars looks pretty cool right. This face of Mars made it to hollywood and radio talks and books. People were egar to see this face, once they saw it then there was alien talk. We all know its cool to think there might be life out there, but it's just a natural landform.

Even though this face is so detailed with the mouth and the eyes and nose, it's just a natural landform. NASA even said it for themselves. " Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was NO alien monument after all." So, If a professional NASA team says it's a landform, i'm not going to argue on the debate.

However if your still not conviced I have more to prove. I haven't heard any information about aliens being true or alive. So, why would we still believe and hold on to the fact that there may not be life out there. NASA hasn't said anything about aliens but they have said that things happen. Such as the face on mars.

Although there are many, many facts about the face on Mars, I would get if you came up to me and said "Aliens did this to Mras because its so detail and how could that be if no one has been to Mars, so there are aliens." Only because we don't actually know if there are aliens ,but in the end its just lava that created this dome like face. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion there are no aliens and its just a landform. NASA said it's just a landform and there isn't really information about aliens so im going to say that it just happened to be a lucky landform that just happened to show up as a face.
