The challenge of Exploring Venus... sounds intreseting righ? Heres my summary of the passege. This passae was written by an author who is unknown but he/she gave facts on the "Evening Star" also know as Planet Venus.

Through out the passage the author tells us that Venus is the closet planet to resemble Earth refuring to both planets density and size. But the climate on Venus is quit different then Earths, for instance the average tempeature is over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. But National Aeronautics and space Adminstration (NASA) is working on how we humans can live on Venus if Earth was horibly damaged. I think that we should always contenue to expand our knowlege, expecilla our science. traveling to Venus would give us protection and a place to live if Earth was unhabital.

So in concloution I think that we should always contenue to expand our knowlege, expecilla our science. traveling to Venus could give us protection and a place to live if Earth was unhabital.
