Extra-curricular activities average

We should be able to get to play any extra-curricular activities as long as we have a passing grade. I understand that we need to be passing but we should at least be able to play with a C average and not a B average. Some people don't understand what they are learning sometimes and what they are doing and why they are getting questions wrong. In the other hand other people passing with flying colors and be really good test takers also they now what they are doing and understand every process.

If the people that are struggling should go to a TAKS class or get tutoring from the subject that they are not passing. They could also get help from a student that understands that specific class so that away they both aren't having extra homework because they can teach each other with the homework. That way, They will both get better by learning from their mistakes also they will both have better confidence knowing that they both can walk out of the class being prepared to walk into the TAKS test with no problem and walk out with a commended rating.

Any body can teach them anything as long as the other student and the trainer want to put in their time and extra effort then they can achieve any thing. They just have to put their minds together because two minds are better than one. So if they try to succeed than they will because effort is more than anyone would imagine.
