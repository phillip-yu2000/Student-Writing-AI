Space the last place humans have to quench their thrst for exploration. Venus has a highly hostile atmosphere it's tempatures round to about 800 degrees fahrenheit (Challenge, 3). The author states that exploring venus is a worthly pursuit the author claims, this is how he supports that claim.

The author shares that, since venus has one of the closest orbits to earth, It will save on travel cost (Challenge, 2). This is based in fact the fuel cost to even get a rocket of of the earth is astonomical, to enter a steady orbit around venus that will drive the cost up even more. however that cost will still be a lot cheaper than if

NASA shot for jupiter or another planet further away in our solar system.

The author goes on to say what NASA plans are to support a scientists life above the surfice of venus. He says "A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the above the rolling Venusian landscape. just like our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way" (Challenge, 5). the Blimp-like vehicles can possibily support a human living on it for a few months while staying out of the way of the storms.

In conclusion, the author seems to have stated his points well with exstenive research. He wrote a well thought out essay, with facts and science to back it up.
