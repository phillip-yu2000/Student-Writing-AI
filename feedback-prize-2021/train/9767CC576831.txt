Today I'am going to convincing you that you should participate and the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that you should participate because you get to go on a cruise like Luke did and the story of A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves story. Also you get to have fun and If you have not been on a cruise before you get to try to have fun why you are doing your work like going to check on the animals but be careful. If you like to be a cowboy and a cowgirl you can participate in the program if you like cruise's and animals. You can always can help out the animals and the people if you see them and you trouble like trying to get there animals to eat and you see them going crazy you can help out. Luke's claims from the article that he try's to like help out the animals by going to check on the animals ever each time to get his work done on time. He one time failed down the stairs to check on the animals but he couldn't work becaues his rib was broken but he was doing fine. Luke was always do his work but he do a good job to finish his job on the cruise. Luke claims was okay because he try to get done so he can check on the animals because he don't wont to get fired from the Cowboy Waves program because he like working as a cowboy he might be a cowboy that's might be why he work there because he can talk to his friend's and he might give people visit's on the cruise to see the animals to get food and to see the animals to. Luke might show you the place if you participate and the program i will to because it sound fun to be and the program. All i was trying to say that you should participate and the Cowboy Who Rode the Waves program because it might be fun because you get to be on a cruise.
