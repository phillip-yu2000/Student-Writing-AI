Dear Principal ******,

As you must have heard of, you are considering to change one of the school's policies about having a B average to attend any sport activities. You sure must realize many kids won't like this idea, obviously because they want to attend sports and have lower than a B average. So, Mrs. ******, I am writing this letter to you to argue to you my points about why this is a very bad idea and also why the school board will most likely not pass this policy of yours.

First of all, we have no school sponsored sports at our school. Legally, you can't ban kids from school not to attend other types of sponsored sports. Unless you are their legal parent or guardian, then this surely won't work. Majority of parents will most likely disagree with this plan, whether its football, swimming, tennis, etc. and so will the rest of the school. You don't have the right to decide what they do and don't do if it's outside of the school's grasp.

My second point I am making to you is about the standard you expect enthusiastic children who want to play sports to reach. A B point average is a little above average, and yet a C point average is a passing grade. If you're going to set a level, at least make it fair. These are first and second graders we're talking about here. At least in high school, they require only a C point average, and yet you make it harder on these kids. If you don't see my point here, then you clearly don't know what fair means.

Finally, why would sports be the thing you would be banning? These kids are around ages five through eleven, and are very energetic. You wouldn't want these kids to become overweight or diabetic, would you now? The exercise is very good for them, you and I know that. To try and ban this at such a high standard for them is ridiculous, and we all know that.

This "policy" of yours is a very bad idea, but I'm not the one making the decisions. What you do is entirely up to you. The reason I'm going against your idea is because I love to play football, and I'm only seven years old. And also because you are the one who asked for our opinions. But go ahead and try to pass it if you'd like. It won't get passed by the district office, that's for sure. And did you even talk to the vice principal about this yet? She sure wouldn't like this idea. So the choice is yours. I hope you pick wisely.

Sincerely,

****** ********
