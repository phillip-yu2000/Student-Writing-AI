I agree wth this decision. Students should participate in atleast one extracurricular activity. Students can get benefits from doing some of these activities. They should do these activities because it can benefit his or her life later on, it can help their school education, and it can make them more physically active for the upcoming sports they wanna do. Some extracurricular activities can be fun to do too!

Extracurricular activities can benefit his or her life later on. When students do some of these activities work employees might be needing some of that skill for their business. Some of the activities can help you get jobs that pay you well to serve your loved ones. Students could serve or even help their country by doing these activities! Activities like artclub and student council and other activities can benefit them.

After school programs are activities that could help your education. Education is a really important thing in life. It can help you out later on when your an adult. Some schools have after school programs that help out your education. The more education students have the more easier it will be for them.

Some activities can help their physical life. Being more active can benefit their health and let them live longer as they get older and keep doing sports. Extracurricular activities like track, soccer, and baseball can be good for your health because the more they do it then the less tired they will get. Soccer and track can be good for their stamina because they will be able to run fo long periods of time without getting tired. Sports can get you payed very well if your really good and the more better you are then more people are gonna want you to play for them and they will pay you good amounts of money.

I agree with this decision because it can help the students future when they get older. Activities like these can give you lots of benefits. And it can make your life easier and healthier.
