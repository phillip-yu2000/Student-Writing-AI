Dear Principal,

I believe we all need to do community service. I feel that it will help the community and help us as students also. It can help the students at our school stay out of trouble, or give them stuff to write down in there college application. I fell if we don't make the students do it they will never learn to be responsible. They will never be pushed to help the community. They wont care enough to.

I think if you make us do this it will help our future. Some people need to do this work or they could end up in a bad place like jail because they wont stay out of trouble. This keeps those kinds of kids out of trouble and doing something that could change their life forever. Because if you think about it you get the kids of the streets and maybe they will stop using drugs and not join gangs or rob people. There are many things these kids need help with.

If you plan in going to college this would be a great thing to put on your college application. To show that you had something to do with your community would be great. Some schools really look for that kind of stuff.

Then there is just to feel good about yourself. To know you have done something in your community that could have helped people should make you feel good about yourself and feel good about what you have done.

I also think it would help us see how much we have and how little so people in our community have. How it seems so easy for us to get by but it is so hard for them to.

That is just my opinion though you are the principal you need to do what you think is best. Than you for your time.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
