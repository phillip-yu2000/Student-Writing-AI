Dear, Senator of Florida I think that we should change the electoral college to the election of popular votes for the president of the United States. So, that the people of the United States can elect which President and Vice President they want in the White House. In the Electoral College there are 538 electors and 270 out of 538 electors are required to elect the President. To the people of the United States thats not fair cause if 269 electors pick one President and the other 269 pick other President who wins then.

Let's not forget about the U.S. presidential Race in the 2000. When Bush won the the election because he had 271 electoral vote s and

Al Gore only had 266. But, Gore had more individual votes than

Bush only if we didn't have the El ectoral College

.

that's why Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL CIO all agree to abolish the electoral college

.

The reason why the electoral college is wrong because when voters vote there not voting for the president your really voting for a slate of electors, who might or might not vote for the president you voted for. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of electors pledged to Kerry. And if they won the nationwide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electors votes. This is the reasons why I think the electoral college should be changed.
