Dear Principal,

Hello, I am writing this letter to you today just to give you my perspective on your new policy of who should and shouldn't be able to try out and play school sports.

I can completely relate to where you are coming from.

And I can somewhat relate to what you are talking about.

The only problem I have with that idea is that I feel that some students will feel bad for being left out even though a C is average.

I also think that there should be no way to be knocked out of track.

I say this because everyone is always talking and thinking about obesity.

This is not like football or basketball or any other sports like that.

The reason being is that the main reason people run track is either to lose weight or to get fit.

I know what you are thinking.

you are thinking, why can't they run on their own.

It takes a lot of motivation to get out and run on your own.

I know this because I run a good bit.

It was a lot harder to get myself going, mentally and physically when I started than it is to now.

Now, back to the subject of which I was writing you earlier.

I am going to have to say that with any passing grade I personally think you should be able to play any school sports.

If you do not do this then lots of kids who just don't want to try harder in school will just say, "the heck with it" and never even give it a second thought.

I also think that there are a lot of athletes out there and don't always try their hardest.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
