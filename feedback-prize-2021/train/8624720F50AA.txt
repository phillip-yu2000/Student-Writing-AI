Dear Principle,

I am on the side of which all students should perform in community service. I do not think you should pick their community service options. You should make a list of different activities. As in helping in a daycare, or helping in girl/boy scouts. Have a list of those different things and have lines under each service. The lines are provided for the people to write their name if they are interested. The people who do not sign up for anything should suffer a consequence. The consequence will be of your choice of course. I would not want the students mad at me. You should also add charity work to the list. Like the walk for Breast Cancer. Things that you know your students are going to want to do. If you pick something like, mowing the lawn for your neighbor. We're not going to want to do something like that. We are children we like to do things that are fun to us.

You should also set up awards. Like the person to do the most charity work gets a free ticket to the movies. Also at the end of each month, you can set up a special amount of work done. Each time the students reach the goal we can have a free dress day or a dance. If you like my idea and want to go along with it or make a few changes, call me down to your office and let me know. Also if you need any other ideas, I will be more than welcome to help.

Your Truly,
