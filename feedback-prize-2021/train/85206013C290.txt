People should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because this program helps other countries during World War 2. We help these countries with their supplies.

We went to these countries when the Pacific war was over. Our ship even provided us something to pass time. This is why I think you should join the program.

The UNRRA hires Seagoing Cowboys to help take care of animals before we get to the countries. To pass time you would play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games. You are able to do a lot of sight seeing, like seeing Europe and China, or seeing the Acropolis in Greece. You help countries with their food supplies, animals, and more. You even talk with people with other nations that help you.

This is why I think you should join the UNRRA. You are able to see Europe and China. You help other countries recover their supplies. You talk to other people from other nations. This is your opportunity of a lifetime.
