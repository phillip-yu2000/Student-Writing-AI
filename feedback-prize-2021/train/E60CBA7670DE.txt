Can you imagine a world with free personal transportation? A world where there's not a need to own a car,becsuse the public tansporation is free and reliable. Public transportation such as the city bus is a common mode of travel within the city,but replacing independent driving with automatic cars is a controversial subject.

In my opinion,driverless cars are a wonderful invention. As it is commonly known,there is a ridiculous amount of c02 polluting out air. I think that lower amounts cars out driving would improve the air quality and the health of wildlife in the area. Drivers may become bored more easily when driving because they are not focusing on driving but in my opinion even this is a positive factor. I say that its a positive factor, because people tend to get distracted while driving which could cause crashes. Car wrecks are completely avoidable,and I think should make changes in technology to prevent occurences like that.

All in all,I think that self driven cars are a positive innovation. I hope to see them on the road soon.
