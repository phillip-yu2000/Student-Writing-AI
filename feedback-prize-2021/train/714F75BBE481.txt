Some resones to join the program are that you can help people after they have had a hard time. The situation from the text is after World War ll there was alot of destruction in Europe. So Luke went over to Europe to help people get thier lives back. Being a Seagoing Cowboy wasn't all just work you also got to travle the world and see cool places. He said that he and other people on the boat had fun on the way back.

He said that he saw some cool places, and did cool thing, like seeing the Panama Canal or go on a gandola ride in Veince, Italy. Whe the stalls were emty ,he said, that alot of guys on the ship would play games to make the time pass. Some of the games that he had mentoined were baseball, volleyball, table tennis, and many others. They helped pass the time by playing games, is what he said.

I think that he made it sound very appealing to be a Seagoing Cowboy it definetily had it's up's an down's. Like cleaning the stals would be a down, and a up would be playing games. Also being able to go see and do things in other parts of the world.
