I am for driverless cars. I think that it's incredible that our technology is becoming so advanced and that we know how to create such a legendary car. In paragragh two, it's said that television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves and it's finally becoming a reality.

There are pros and cons of this idea. Even though I think a driverless car is a good idea there needs to be improvements and more work on these cars. A pro of this invention is it can take you where you need to go and is pretty much safe. For example, a driverless car would be great for someone that is intoxicated that needs to go home. Even if someone is intoxicated that person would still need a designated driver because the car needs a human driver that must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires, as stated in paragragh 7. Another pro, which is stated in paragragh 8, is "some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the drivers need to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone." That is a great safety feature about this car. Most car accidents are from texting and driving and with this system it can end texting accidents. A con of the driverless car is that it still needs improvements. This car is not completely ready to be sold in dealerships. To ride in this car the human driver must stay alert and pay attention at all times.

With everything said about this driverless car I think it's a great idea and should keep being improved so it can be in dealerships. In my opinion it will be the best car out there and less accidents will happen. Can't wait for what our technology can officially do for us.
