There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes "In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars" to show that limiting car usage helps to "reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes..." Their goal is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released into our atmosphere because it is destroying Earth. The gases are destroying the ozone layer drastically, and if this continues Earth will be gone. She also wrote "The End of Car Culture" explaining that the number of cars bought has reduced, bu in reality it is a good thing because it reduces the amount of pollution in the air, and money could be used on something more productive. Cars have not been the main priority of in America. People began to carpool, ride bikes, ride the bus, etc. This will "save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety." Additionally, Robert Duffer writes "Paris bans driving due to fog" explaining how "Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals..." In Paris, many people are using cars, and they release the bad smoke into the atmosphere. By all the gases being combined together, it creates smog which is deadly. It can cause many health problems to humanlife and the nature. Another article to support that it is better off to limit car usage is "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota" by Andrew Selsky. Selsky quotes a business man Carlos Arturo, "'It's a good oppurtunity to take away stree and lower air pollution.'" Even citizens agree that it is necessary for people to limit how much they drive because it streeses people out. They don't have to worry about spending a drastic amount of money on gas, or repairing the car. It is easier just to ride a bike which helps you save money, and even get a good execrise. It also limits air pollution because less cars are being driven and not alot of harmful gases are being released. Overall, there are benefits in not having a car.
