I agree with policy 1. I agree with this policy because I have a cell phone of my own of which I use daily. I believe that we should be able to use our cell phones in school as long as we keep them on vibrate, and aren't using them during class time when we are supposed to be learning. That could be a real distraction to us, and the teachers if we are texting in the middle of class.

One other reason that I agree with policy 1 is because our parents buy our cell phones so that they can keep in touch with us. For example, what if there was an emergency in my family and I didn't have my cell phone on, I would be lost. Or even if I just put something somewhere at home and my mom just wanted to text me and ask me where I put it. Instead of having to call the school and take my class time away to ask a simple question.

One other reason that agree with policy 1 is because you should be able to call your mom or someone when you have a chance.
