I don't think drivers should be able to use their phones while they are driving. They are distracting to the driver who needs to focus on the road. I think there is an extent to using them while operating a vehicle though.

When driving it is very important to pay attention to what's around you and the road.

Distractions in the car while driving can be dangerous to everyone in the vehicle. Phones are a big distraction present in almost every ones car. Waiting to respond to notifications is a lot safer then driving and using your phone. Texting and driving is a huge cause of car accidents all the time.

I think there is an extent to where people can use their phones while operating there car.

Phone calls can be distracting but now cars have it where you can hear the other person from the speakers and you can speak to them without touching the phone. Some people also use their phones as a GPS.

You could use a phone while driving but there are smart and safe ways to. You still shouldn't do though to ensure your safety and that there are no distractions.
