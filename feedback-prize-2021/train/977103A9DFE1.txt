Dear principal

I would like to tell you that it is a bad idea for you to change the school policy so that the student should at least have a B average. Its bad because most people don't get to a B average there's only a little of people that gets to that point.

So when its time for try outs you wouldn't have a team cause there will only be 5-10 people there. Also for activities, such as doing a project of some sort. If you do that you wouldn't have activities because no one will join because there friends are not there. By doing what you think is right you are hurting people chances of playing a sport or a activities that the kid's like to do. I suggest you keep it the same so everyone have a chance of doing a activity or a sport. Mainly for the bad kids.

It's something all kids would like to do instead of sitting in the house all day doing nothing, so i think you should think about this a little bit longer to really see if you want to do this or not.

SINCERELY,
