Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME. I would just like to tell you that people would like to play in outer curriculum activities. Students have problems sometimes of not being able to do there homework.

Some students cant get help at home. some of the teachers don't help the students with homework questions. the parents might of forgot how to do some of the stuff. Others weren't taught in school how to do the stuff. Some have chores at home that they are responsible for.

Some students have chores at home that they are responsible for. Some people have animals that they are in charge to take care of. RELATIVE_NAME had to feed his dog, cook supper every other night. Then he has to take care of his little brother. Then after he's done with that its 9:00 at night.

Other people might say that would be a good idea. The reason they would say that is because some students don't do there homework and schoolwork. Then there are the students that let sports get in the way of school. So they would agree on that.

So that's why i believe that we don't need the grade average to go up any higher than a D+. thank you and talk to the students.
