Dear Principle,

I think students shouldn't be required to community service simply because we have other things to do in our life's besides community service. It would possible take up personal time that we could have used to do something else like do a project. Wouldn't you be angry if u was required to do something that was a waste of time. Community service could effect us dramatically academic wise. We could be so tired that we fall a sleep in class. Could we learn this way? No! Requiring community service wouldn't be necessary. Students shouldn't have to perform this task at all if there isn't a logical explanation behind it. Lets just say one day a student has a band practice or any other school activity and doesn't get time to practice because they had to do community service. So the concert comes up and the student couldn't play there part right so it sounds horrible. How would you feel if a weight like that was on your shoulders? Community service is a waste of time not necessary and shouldn't be required.

Sincerely ,

STUDENT_NAME
