Dear Mrs Principal,

I think that it is good idea to change the policy for students. I think that it is good because if you don't have a good grade then you shouldn't be able to play sports. Kids who don't have a good grade average means they don't do their homework. Homework is to be done at home and if they don't do their homework then they shouldn't go to practice or maybe stay after school to go to practice. The kids should make up their work and actually do homework rather then go to practice and other activities.

Another reason is that,

if they stay back they should be kicked off the team because it isn't fair that the kids who do good and pass get to do another year.

Another reason is that, the kids who do good in school do their homework and still go to practice when other kids are lazy. Its not fair to other kids who do their homework. Maybe you should warn the kids about the policy so they could get their grades up before you actually change the policy so a lot of kids don't get kicked out of their sport. If they don't bring their grades up and get kicked out of their sport, if they bring their grades up maybe you can allow them to go back to their sport. If they keep the good grade then they can do sports but if they don't then you can kick them out of sports.
