Phones and Driving

There are some people in this world that are extremely good at multitasking but... most aren't. If you feel like you can be on your phone while you're driving you are out of your mind. I feel like the only reasons you should be able to use your phone in the car/ operating machinery is when your using the GPS or trying to play music and at that point you should be using voice control.

Like I said at the beginning of the introduction a lot of us in this world cannot multitask. We don't have the attention span to pay attention to the road and be on our phones. As soon as we see that text from our mom, significant other, or crush whoever it may be we immediately look at the phone and try to text them back. Me knowing me I can't try to do anything phone related because once I'm on my phone I check all my emails, social media, and everything interesting there. Trying to operate machinery while while being on your phone is extremely life threatening especially using power tools and or heavy equipment. When I say heavy machinery I mean cars too. Texting and driving or even being on the phone are driving are one of the biggest factors in the death rate of the united states at a whopping 41.75% a year.

Voice control... I feel like that should be something very high on all phone companies list when it comes to making the device. With voice control everything is easier and the death rate via texting and driving could be potentially cut down to a much better number like 25%. With all of that being said I feel like using our phones on the road and when driving is a very bad idea and is something that could use great improvement.
