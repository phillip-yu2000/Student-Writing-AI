Cars are used everyday in work and social life, and they play an important role in transportation, some people buy them for fun and others buy them as a neccesity for daily life. But recently we have been cutting back on the usage of cars and we could extend the life of our planet by simply not driving.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and it caused Paris to ban driving for a little while due to smog, environmental conditions worsen by the day and it is apparent. Yet we still drive our fancy cars around like there isn't a problem. "Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the U.S." states Elisabeth Rosethal from the article "In German Suburb Life goes on without cars." That is a lot of pollution entering our atmosphere.

Americans and other citizens around the world have increasingly recognized this problem and started taking the initiative to change it. In Bogota, Colombia one day out of the year all cars are banned except taxi's and busses. "Violaters faced 25 dollar fines... but the turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped rain showers" Andrew Skelsky says from the article "Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota." This just shows what we can do if we try, and for the first time two other cities joined the event.
