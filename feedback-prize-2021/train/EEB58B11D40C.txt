I disagree that the principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity cause some students just have lots of work and some students just don't want to do it. First of all,students have lots of work to do like homework,chours, projects, and etc. These things are a lot for some students to handle. adding a extracurricular activity that students must participate in would increase some students stress and could cause students to fail in school cause of how much work they have to do and complete. Finaly, some students just don't want to do it. Beause most students would finish their work and hang out and talk with their friends. If students where forced into participating in at least one extracurricular activity it would decrease the amount of time each student would have spending time with their friends. In conclusion, I think that what the principal decision was not a good and was a very very bad.
