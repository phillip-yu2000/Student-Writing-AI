Dear Principal,

I think that community service is important. All of us want our community to be kept clean. The best way to make a sure of that, is to do it ourselves.

Many people care about our community. They respect this clean environment and never litter. Instead, they throw out their garbage to garbage cans and recycling bins. This is what every person should do. Sometimes people don't care about keeping the community clean. They throw out their garbage on the grass or a sidewalk. Most of the time, there is no people to pick this garbage up. Some people don't just litter. They might even put graffiti on public building. This doesn't make our community look clean.

As students who live in the same neighborhood, we should take care of it somehow. Picking up garbage is defiantly the first step. We could create a group that will pick up garbage in different areas every day. It won't take long either. If a large group of people would get involved, it would not even take 15 minutes to clean up a designated area. Another group could be made for graffiti removal. This is a little more time consuming and more pricy, but effects would be immediately noticed. It would make our buildings and streets look clean and new.

I hope you consider my proposal. It is very important to help our society. The sooner we began, the better for our community and people who live in it.

Sincerely,
