I think that boys should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Because during this trip you get to go place that you have never been before, take care of animals, and not only work but you get to play games and sports.

One thing that I did on my aventure was I went and saw Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and Marvled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

Seagoing Cowboys half to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Once I had to get on the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

Plus in the spare time the cowboys (us) played baseball and vollyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the other games also helped pass the time.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an aventure.

But it opened up the world to me.

I'm so grateful for the opportunit, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. The awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange vistors for many years.

All of the things that I got to see, do, and play you could to. But the most important thing is that if you join the program then you get to help with things that are important. So what do you say will you join? Or will you stay at home and not help and see the world like I did? But just so you know this is a once and a life time experience. I enjoied, now it's your turn now.
