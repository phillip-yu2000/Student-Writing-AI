I think Drivless Cars would be useful. I feel like they could help alot especially with people that may be handicapt now maybe they can drive. Driveless Cars are the furture and in the future I feel as if anything is possible. If you are handicapt from the waste below and you can move your arms then the Driveless Car could be for them.

Just because they sre handicapt doesn't mean they shouldnt be alowed to drive a car. Driveless Cars could probably stop alot of accidents and prevent damage from being done to something or someone else.

Driveless cars drive on their own unless they need help like in construction sites and around accidents then thats when hat person can help out, but, other than that a handicapt person could drive. Drivelesscars may make everything easier on anyone and evryone. Make sure to stay alert just becuase you aren't completely driving doesn't mean you get to sleep at the wheel.

In conclusion I think that driveless cars would be very helpful and I don't think it wil make us lazy it's just a way to help. Like what if you are coming home from work and you are tired, the driveless car would help you out, but, just like in a normal car you can't fall asleep at the wheel. You never know when tyhr car might need yiour assistance in a situation. In 2020 Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves.
