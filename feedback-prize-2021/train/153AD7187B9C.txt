There are positive and negative aspects of a driverless car. Some people might love the idea on the other hand other people might not. I believe driverless cars are the future, and there going to come up with some very smart cars in the near future.

I believe that driverles cars are a genius idea because you can do anything while the car is driving. Well of course not everything you don't want to be sleeping and the car crashes onto something because it doesn't detect it. Many people run late in the morning on there way to work or school or wherever they might go and maybe didn't have time for breakfest or didn't finish getting ready

I believe that you can do that stuff while the car is in motion. Even though you need a driver there in the car "Tesla is going to release a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time" which means you'll only be driving that ten percent which isn't alot. Yes I do believe the safety of one another is very important but I think the manufactures wouldn't release a car if they knew it wasn't capable of doing the things that the manufactures promised. I am all for driverless cars but safety is very important to me but just like the article says " the road to truly autonomous cars stretches ahead of us, we grow to the destination every day".
