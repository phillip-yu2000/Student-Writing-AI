Dear Principal,

I think community service is very important and it helps us appreciate what we have and to be considerate of those who have less than us.

It can be fun to do with friends and family I think we should consider this as a wonderful opportunity to bond with friends and family and to help the less fortunate/ community in the process. It helps bring a sense of unity amongst us young people and I think that it is just fun to make people smile and to make the world a better place in the process.

And for the people that think community service is a waste of time or it takes time away from their studies, maybe you could add some extra study halls into their courses. Or, you find a way to make community service more appealing in some way. So that every one will want to do it, and not feel forced into it.

If that doesn't work, you can tell them it always looks good on future applications.

From tutors to trash cans, it always benefits the community in some way.

So you really can't go wrong with service.

Please take into consideration what i have said.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
