Modern day technology can identify human emotions. One very strong claim and great example is the 3D computer model. It begins when the computer constructs the model of a human face or painting.

Leonardo da Vinci, a famous artist, painted The Mona Lisa, but new technology computer software can recognize emotion, according to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. The 3D computer model can construct all 44 major muscles in the humans body, but it must move like human muscles. The movent of one or more muscles during this process is called an "action unit". According to Dr. Huang, "facial expressions for each emotion are universal", even though some individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

When using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can track facial movements in a real face in a student or painting. Weighing in different units, the software can identify mixed emotions because each experssion is compared against a neutral face. For instance, in person, you can probably tell how someone is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. Scientists and Professors today would go over types of human emotions through the 3D computer model.

The home PC you own can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's or any humans smile. The Facial Action Coding System only enables lab computers or computers at a University to identify human emotions. This same technology is used to make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

In conlusion, modern day technology can identify human emotions through a 3D computer or The Facial Action Coding System. The value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is very valuable and can be used to express how someone feels. I'm 100% for the use of this technology becuase this is a one of a kind new age technology.
