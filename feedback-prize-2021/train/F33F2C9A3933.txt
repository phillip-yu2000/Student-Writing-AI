If you think the face in mars was created by aliens your wrong. Am about to tell you why your wrong. Am also going to convince you that the face is just a natural landform.

First of all the first picture was blury but we took new ones and they are better.''Michael malin and his mars orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orinal viking photos''.The camera also can see anything if ther was life down ther. Michael malin also said ''as a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,''he added.''So if ther were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were!"

In the passage it says that the face is nothing but a land scape form"what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of butte or mesa-landforms common around the american west. This also happens on earth sometimes. "It reminds me most of middle butte in the snake river plain of idaho"says Garvin.

So if you still think that the martian land form, as it should be called,was created by aliens, than think twice because thats all the information i need to prove you wrong.
