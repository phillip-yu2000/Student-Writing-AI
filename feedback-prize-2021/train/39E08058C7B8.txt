Dear principal,

I do think that not allowing kids that have lower than a B average to participate in sports is a very good idea. Some kids don't use their time well because of sports. By making them get Bs or higher they will learn this necessary skill that they will need in the future, like time management. The kids who love sports will be encouraged by this and will try to bring their grade up to at least a B.

Kids will also (if not in it already) be prepared for high school. In high school their will be more sport options and it also has more work. So if they play sports, and don't have this policy then they'll crash and burn. If kids really like sports and wants to exceed in high school, then they'll appreciate this policy.

I

think this will be good for us all. It'll get us through high school and other things in the future.

Scincerely,
