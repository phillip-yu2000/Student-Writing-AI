Most people might suggest to keep the electoral college work. Yet some other people don't. The method "Winner-Takes-All" is only fair enough, because why should the person who lost earn a reward , the people made their desicions, and whoever lost, goes back home.

Keeping the Electoral College also avoids problem of election, because once the votes are in,

and they count the votes, there are no more talking but to accept the winner.

Winner Takes All, when competing in for election, its not right to share your reward with the opposing component. Once you win, you take it all. when election comes and the citizens vote, "They are likely to be most thoughtful voters, on average(and for the further reasom that they will have recived the most information and attention from the candidiates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election." (source#3, paragraph 20). Although people may disagree and say "Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the"swing" states."(source#2, paragraph 13). Yes, that may be true, but again, when the people vote, they only want what they want, no jokes.

The Electoral College is helping to avoid problems of election.
