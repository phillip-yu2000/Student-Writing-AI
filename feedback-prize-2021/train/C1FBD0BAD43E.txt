With the coding system being able to read emotions almost aswell as we humans can, the system may be incorprated into security systems and schools. The Facial Coding System could advice teachers if students are bored or tired as stated in paragraph 6 "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored". Having a system that could do that would improve the teachers teaching skills for a more fun way of teaching rather than the old monitione lectures. The Facial Coding System can improve the lesson, like an effective human insructor.

If the Facial coding System becomes a valuable System in schoold it could not just improve students educatin but reduce the amounts of absent kids per year. Due to a more enjoyable education kids wouldn't miss out as much as they do. If The Facial Action Codig System is in computers students will more thn likely look up at their screens than their phones. Computers will aslo have to understand that most humans communication is nonverbal as stated by Dr. Huang. This leading to the system needing minor adjustments before a succesful future.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable system and has many possibilities of being used for schools and for various purposes. Not only is the system valuable, it gives others an acknowledgment of how you feel and in how many ways they can help. If you feel upset for any reason anyone could now help by the press of a button.
