Need advice? People ask multiple people for their opinions because they may need more help, looking for a more mature idea or comparing the advice for a better idea of what they need.

People may ask for more advice because they need more help on decisions they are making or can't decide of what to do or say in the situation they are in. It all really depends on the situation and what they are going through to make the mature decision. Asking immature people isn't really a good idea in my opinion because they could get you in trouble or ending up not making the best decision. I think to make the best decisions is to ask advice from someone you trust and are really close to and they are mature enough to give you the best advice.

They may want to be the better person in the situation and be more mature and ask for more mature advice or thinking to seek a better decision, and a better choice depending on the situation they are going through or what they are deciding. I think that being the mature one and the better person is the best decision to make or do. If some people think that asking for multiple peoples advice is making them seem desperate or needy that is wrong because you need and should make the right choice for you..

People may compare advice given to them because they may like some of the advice they have been given so then they will combine some of it so they can make a good choice. Which I think is a good idea for people to use as long as they make a smart and good decision best for them. So, asking for multiple ideas and advice is a good thing to do because it gives you more help, you make a mature decision and you can compare and combine the advice and ideas you are given to make the better decision and it can make your life better in the end if you make a good and smart decision for you and your peers and you wont have any regrets...Â
