Say if you need help attacking a problem, this problem could be anything like what book should i read for this summer, well by asking for other peoples opinions it could help you out a lot. Because sometimes it could make you feel more comfortable about this topic. Also it could give you an answer quicker. But it could help you because they have more experience with this topic so that could help so you get the right answer. For example say if you needed help for who you should take to prom you could ask one of your friends that has a lot of experience so that could tell you if this girl or guy is a good person or if they have a good personality you can get the easiest answer by just asking your friend.

It could help you by learning from their answer so next time you question you don't even need to ask. This could also create a better relationship with your friend. Also by asking more than one friend is even better because you could get better answer about your topic. From asking opinions it could make you smarter by knowing more about this topic like from my example before you would know who not to take to prom or who you should take to prom.

Asking for peoples opinions is a great resource. Because the answer that your getting is more likely to be right then wrong because if you just went with your answer it could be wrong but by asking friends it could give you more time to thing about this topic. Also if you ask for multiple opinions it could help you get the answer faster because by over ruling the other answer. Say if you wanted to know if the book that you wanted to get was good from asking multiple opinions you would know what to pick. that why asking friends or just random people for there opinion is such a good resource.
