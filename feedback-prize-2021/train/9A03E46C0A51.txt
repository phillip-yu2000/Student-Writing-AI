Dear Principal,

I believe that changing the policy to play sports with a B average or higher is a great idea. Many students need to take responsibility of their grades, if they are or aren't playing sports. Some students, who play sports, concentrate on the game more than their text books.

Getting above C average grades shows good character. If they care about what they get on their assignments and tests, then they should care about how they act towards each other. This would help on the field and in the school building. The players need to build good character so that they can work as a team, achieve well in their grades, and their overall school sportsmanship.

Also, once students get into middle school and high school, grades and sports get serious, especially in high school, because their grades are shown on their transcript when students apply for college. Some collages won't let students ,who get low grades, play on their teams in games. That could affect their whole career. Then they wouldn't know what to do. They would be stuck and would have to apply for smaller college. They would have to pay for collage instead of getting a scholarship. Everyone knows that can get really pricey if you don't have a lot of money. Plus, in this economy, you need every last dollar you can get. If the students get a loan and can't pay it off, they could end up in debt.

Getting a B average grade in their classes would help the students feel proud of themselves for accomplishing what they want to achieve, whether it is getting a good grade, being able to apply for a big collage, have a well displayed transcript, or have a good recommendation for a collage application that is reflected off of their significant character, or any thing else that they are happy about getting. This would help the school's students entirely and to help each individual student's best work shine out.

Sincerely,

anonymous student
