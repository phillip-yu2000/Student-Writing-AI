Cell phones are a big issue while driving. Lots of accidents have happened in the past because of people being on their cell phones while driving. The main people that do text or play on their phones while driving are teenagers. There are many ways of solving this problem, but I am only going to be talking about one way to solve it.

One way that we can solve this problem is we can put blue tooth radios in our cars so that if someone calls you there would be a way to answer your phone without picking it up. Most of the newer cars have a Bluetooth radio in them so you don't have to buy one. Although older model cars don't have them you can buy them and install them. Over half of the accidents in the us happen because of people being or checking their phones.

Although it is never okay to use your phone while driving I think that if you solved that problem by getting a radio. If you have a Bluetooth radio, then there should be less of a chance of you getting in an accident because you would be on your phone less. Even though that is a solution you should still never touch you phone while operating a vehicle.
