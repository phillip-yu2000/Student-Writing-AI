Venus, the second planet closest to the sun; scientists speculate it have once had life just like our planet earth. The author supports the idea to pursuit studying the planet Venus despite all the dangers. If we decide to study Venus we can find out what type of life the planet once had, solar power would be valuable to use and we could even find a way to live on the planet.

Venus, earth's sister planet is currently inhospitable for humans. but in paragraph 6 it says, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth." Venus would have at one point in time had life living on it. That is why Astronomers are interested in studying it to learn what type of life lived on Venus and why they are gone. The author is intrigued by his imagination to know what type of creatures or plants that once belonged to this planet but are now gone due to the extreme weather conditions.

The hot fiery climate on Venus can also be incredibly useful. Using it for solar power could change the way we use energy completly. Venus being the hottest planet in the solar system paragraph 3 it states, "On the planetÂ’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit." using solar power on venus would be important for Earth since its a renewable source and Earth runs on mostly unrenewable sources which will one day disappear off the face of the earth.

In paragraph 5, the author states that NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Using a vehicle similar to a blimp it would hover the planet 30 miles above the surface. With this idea temperatures would drop drastically toa a whopping 170 degrees fahrenheit. Air pressure and radiation levels would be similar to earth conditions making it survivable for humans. The author includes this because he wants to make it clesr that exploration on venus is possible. Innovation is key to exploring new places outside of our reach.

The author supports his claim on exploring Venus despite the risks it could cause. He does so by stating positive effects of exploration throughout the text. Exploration of our sister planet Venus is vital to human survival. With global warming, extinction, and unrenewable resources we need to find a suitable planet to get materials and maybe even call home.
