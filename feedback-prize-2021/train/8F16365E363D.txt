Online classes or video conferencing it is one of the many opportunities that some school offer, for those who have a full time job and they really have the volunteer to graduate but they doesn't have the time to attend to school,they still can graduate, taking online classes and complete the credits that they need...

for example: my bother is taking online classes because he works full time, and wants to support the family at the same time.

Students are going to be more than benefit because they will have the opportunity to finish their classes.

The program distance learning has many advantage:

the students will have more space and time to review the same, if they did not understood it.

they will have more privacy they will have a flexible schedule, and they can take the class when they want.

they will not miss any class for any weather changes, etc.

Personally I think that is a great opportunity for us, because if we are not able to attend at school, the school gave us the opportunity to take online classes that way we can finish our classes and to graduate, also it is not like that you have to be there an specific time.
