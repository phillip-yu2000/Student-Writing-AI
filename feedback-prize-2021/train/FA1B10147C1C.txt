I

agree that all students must participate in at least one extracular activity in the school.

Because students can have fun when they sports. Students can have more time to talk to they friends. Students can learn something new every day when they play sports.

Students can have fun when they play sporst, students can have fun when they play soccer, student can have fun when they play basketball,

teachers can have fun helping the students to play sports.

Students can have more time to talk to their friends, they can talk about projects at home or projects at school,

they can talk about what sports they like to ple at home and at school, they can talk about what videogame they like and they can talk about what they do in their free time.

Students can learn something new everiday when they play sports, students can learn how to play soccer,

they can learn the basic rules for soccer , they can learn how to move more fast in a soccer game.
