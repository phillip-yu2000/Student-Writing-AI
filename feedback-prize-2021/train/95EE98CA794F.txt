Asking people for advice is very helpful when you don't know what to do in certain situation you get your self in.

When every i am in a situation and don't know what to do i ask someone for advice most of the time it helps me.

I always like to ask my dad or someone older then me for advice they have lived longer then me and can help you.

When asking for advice i fell like you should always go to more than one person cause some people well not always give you the best advice. Most people can get in a bad situation they cannot get there selfÂ out of and they ask different people for advice. A lot of people are afraid to ask others for advice because they are scared to ask.

But you should never be afraid to ask someone for advice you can get very good advice form someone.

When you ask someone for advice it is not for a dumb reason you as for it for you can get help or knowledge.

Asking multiple people for advice is better to do than asking just one person for it they well not always give you the best advice. If you ask more then one person they well all give you different advice to help you with what you want to know. I would rather ask just more than one person for advice because others have lived longer than you.

I like to ask at the most five or six different people for advice asking more than just one person is better than one.

You don't always have to ask a lot of people for advice it really depends if you are comfortable or not to ask a lot of people. You might just feel comfortable with just asking someone you know or asking just one person you really trust.

So only ask people for advice you know or really trust to talk to for advice because it can help you with your problems.

Why it is important to ask people for advice is you not always know how to get out of a bad problem or situation.

So you just ask someone for advice like a older person because they have been through a lot more than you and have more experiences than you?
