To the Principal,

I am confused to the reason on why you would choose to change the school's policy on admission into sports. I do not believe there needs to be a sudden change in policy, and it seems unfair to the students who have been participating in sports and have also been getting a C grade point average. Therefore, I do not believe a change in school policy would be appropriate to the students of your school. I simply do not understand the point why you wouldn't choose otherwise.

Our school has been excelling in sports activities and competitions for the past few years. These athletic students you allow into your school have a chance at becoming something of themselves, and changing this unneeded policy on admission into sports would crush most of their dreams. Isn't the school of yours supposed to portray spirit and a will to play competitively against other schools? Not only do I believe it is inappropriate to change the school's policy, but I also believe that by doing your act, you will furthermore dwindle the students' knowledge in academics, along with their spirit. I do realize that your students are average compared to other schools. Instead of taking away most of their privileges to being apart of sport activities, why not instead promote their academics and still allow them to participate in sports. This is a just food your thoughts.

On behalf of the students at this school, including myself,
