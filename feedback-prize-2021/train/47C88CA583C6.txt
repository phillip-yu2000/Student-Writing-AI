Dear principal,

I see now it is harder to enter sports or activities.

You see, for some students it is harder to get even a ''B'' average.

At least half of the school is getting a ''C'' average.

Are you going to not permit them to join sports because they have a ''C''?

One of my reasons why students should only have a ''C'' average is because a ''C'' is a passing grade.

I understand that a ''C'' is not really a grade to settle with.

To me a ''C'' grade means that i am falling down and i need to get back up.

So to me it pretty much means a warning.

That should go for other students, too.

You shouldn't just settle with a ''C''.

For example, what if a student is a really great athlete or really loves participating.

Are you really going to take him/her out of all the fun activities just because they have a ''C'' which is passing.

That is like saying,'' I am going to kick you out of activities and sports even though you have a passing grade.'' Not fair, right?

My last reason that i am going to share with you is what if that student is having problems at home or with a close friend or maybe even depression because of a death that occurred.

That is the probably reason why some students can't focus right in school and they are getting a ''C'' instead of them normally getting an ''A'' or ''B''.

Thank you for listening to my reasons.

I hope you see why students should be getting in sports or activities because they even have a passing grade.

Your student,
