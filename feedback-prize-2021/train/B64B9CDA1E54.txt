I think having driverless cars is a great idea. I support it alot because it will make road trips very easier and more exciting for the driver. If taking a long road trip, the driver will be able to sleep as well as the passengers. But the con about that, is that the driver might have issues trusting the driverless car. If the driver dont trust the car, he/she might stay awake as the car have a long trip to where ever the destination is located. Another con will be how might the driverless car react upon other driverless cars. Will the sensors be too hype from every car causing a traffic jam, slow traffic, or maybe an accident. Thats why i also support the driverless cars to let the driver take control at certain points while driving. Eventhough the driver would have to still keep watch of the rode, thats what he or she have to do anyway. So as of right now, ill just say that driverless cars would be good for drivers who like to text while driving and maybe talking on the phone while driving. That is what i think about driverless cars untill they can approve the use of the cars to sleep in while driving.
