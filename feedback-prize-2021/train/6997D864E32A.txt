Many people think that the "Face" is caused by aliens or it's just a natural landform. Which one of these could it be the answer to this mysterys "Face"? Now in days most people think that everything in space that might haved popped out is made by aliens but that is not always the answer. I personally think that it's not caused by aliens but there's always going to be people out there still thinking it was created by aliens.

In 1976 Viking 1 was cirleing around Mars when it took a picture in the region of Mars in Cydonia. It wasn't something that we would expect. It was very surprising, it looked like a face in the photo taken. A few days later NASA released some of the picture they took. Since than the "Face" became very popular it even has been in some Hollywood films.

I think that the "Face" is caused by the natural landform. Have you ever wonder why Mars is like Earth's twin or sisters well because they are alike. Earth has had natural landform just that in Mars it looks different but it doesn't mean nothing it's still a natural landform. Now I do understand why some people might say that it looks like it has been created by aliens cause it does look like a real face. The nose, eyes and mouth litterly looks like a real face of a person but just cause of that it doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

Now here is my true evidence that will convice people that the "Face" wasn't created by aliens. In 1976 was the first photo Viking 1 took. In 1998 another photo was taken later on in 2001 another photo was taken. If you see the pictures it is so obese that the "Face" on Mars is a natural landforming. In the pictures the "Face" looks like if it was changed over the years.
