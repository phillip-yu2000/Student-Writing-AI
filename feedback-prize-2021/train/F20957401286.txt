Luke joined the seagoing cowboys because he wanted to be helpful. but here is the thing no one else from his town joined probibley because they were to scared to even think about even doing the job i cant believ he was the only one to join that is just not right. so some one else needs to join. but no one will join at all so he is the only one to do the job and if i were him i would be so mad i would just quite.

one reason why people should join because they would go tho diffrent places and meet diffrent people and try diffrent food because in the story it says that Luke went to CHINA and gave tem mules horses and cows because some people eat cow and the also ride the horse and mule but they also use them to transeport goods and to till the filde.

now for the conclusion everyone is good at something and every one gets a oportunity to do something in the world because everyone is diffdent ,way diffrent but we all need to be treted the same way. treat others the way you want to be treated.
