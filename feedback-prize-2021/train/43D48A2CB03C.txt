Driveles cars are on the rise and should be allowed everywhere, but only after all the problems are solved. These cars are what soccer moms and very successfull bussiness men been praying for. The self steer aspect of the car helps moms tend to their crazy children who wont stay seated, without the consequence of a crash or worse. Bussiness men can hold conference calls and maybe even do some paperwork during their drive. When the car comes across a difficult terrain it asks you to take over, this may be a problem in the future. These cars will evolve and so will the people who drive them. Humans may be so use to not touching the wheel, that when the car needs their assistance they wont know what to do. Driveless car would be a magnificent addition to the evolution of technology but in my mind I think the driveless vehicle should be a mode that the cars can go on not just the whole car being independent. Put it in this perspective....fifty to hundred years from now the driveless cars are the most distributed brand of transportation and isn't looking to depleat. A particular person is on the highway and is on their way to work. They fall asleep because ithe road looks clear anf they figure they car won't need their assistance, but little do tehy know its a enormous crash a mile ahead. The car is asking for their assistance but their not waking up. What would the car do? Stop right in the middle of the highway or continue to drive.
