Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have been hearing that a new cell phone policy is possible. I know that students may abuse the privilege of having phones in school but if they can be off in class or if the teacher can be diligent and notice if a student is texting in class, then i would agree with policy 1.

If students miss the bus or have to stay late, there should be a way for them to make contact with their parents or someone to pick them up. If there is in an accident at a sports practice or event and contact needs to be made, cell phones would be very convenient. Many people would agree but they are usually older teachers who are fed up with technological advances and the ability to do things easier. These are the people that would rather wait a week for a newspaper advertisement than go on the internet and find something in two minutes.

There have been problems with students using cell phones in a way that is not recommended in school and that is not surprising. With every new thing, there comes a problem. That's just life. I don't understand why people cannot except that concept. Most students would agree with the truth that cell phones do more good than harm.

Here is an example. Imagine a student had wrestling practice after school and halfway through practice, he tears a muscle. He needs to be taken to the emergency room immediately or he may be incapacitated for several months. He brought a cell phone to school that day so he called 911 and was picked up. He was bandaged up and was soon wrestling again.

The moral of the story is that cell phones help people in times of need and are simply more convenient. If cell phones were completely removed from schools, there would be many occurrences that could be in need of a cell phone's help, but instead have to deal without them.
