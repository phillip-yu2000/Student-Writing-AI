should we have less car usage in the U.S.? The answer is yes because it could stop alot of the pollution going into the atmosphere. This could help with the green house gases going into the ozone layer and harming the earth.

One reason that we should cut back on car use is because of the green house gases going into the air. In Europe passenger cars are why 12% of green house gases arer from there. But the U.S. is even more responsible for the woping 50% in somer areas here. So if you were to cut back here that would be a good thing so you can cut back on the pollution. I bet if you were to use bikes instead of cars it would cut back on the 50% of green house gases here. For example take a look at NewYorks bike-sharing program helped out the mobile world so think about it.

Another reason is a lot of people really like the fact that not having cars is a great factor to the earth. Just take a look in Germany in the town of VAUBAN residents of this town went from being minivan driving soccer moms to people who feel at ease because thw willingly gave up there cars. Which a lot of people cannot do just like that. 70% of the families in Vauban do not own cars and about 57% sold there cars just to move there which means that they all willfuly gave up there automobiles just to stay in that town and that has cut back on a lot of pollution in Europe. In the passage a women says "when i had a car i was always tense. I am much more happier this way."

so in conclusion, i belive that giving up your car to cut back on pollution just like they did in Europe is a great idea because quite frankly. I think we would be in a whole better situation if we did. This would mean a lot of the green house gases in the ozone now would not get added onto. so to me bike are a perfect way of doing this or even walking is a good substitution. So after i've explained everything are you in or out?
