Everyone should join the Seagoing Cowboys. The Seagoing Cowboys help a lot of people from when they were injured during World War Two. This oppertunity will help you see the real world and helping others just like you want help sometimes. I think it is so fun that I've been on the trip 18 times. If you're in the military, this will show how you serve others and help them. In this great job in which you will also get to travel the high seas! There might be a lot of dangerous stuff that will happen because your in the ocean, like the time that I cracked my ribs and I couldn't go on some trips for a while but it was an an adventure. I was scared after that but I knew that all that matters is if you have a good time and you get to see the great work you're doing. You also get to stop places and get to sightsee places that you might have never seen before, it's a blast. So come join and have a blast as you join the seagoing pirates and help the people that have been injured in other countries from World War Two.
