some peole believe distance learning is a good opcion for students, because they can be at home, and they can take the classes they need and with this opcion they are able to do others activities, they need to do everyday.

for example, students who don't have the enought of money and they need to work.

this show that many students get benefits from this opcion that school give to students, because students can work by the day and take the class by the night.

in another example we have students that for any reason can not attend to school.

they could stay at home and also get the credits they need to graduate from schoool.

this opcion is also good for the students who want to graduate early from school. for example, students that only want to be by 3 years at school, they can take the regular classes and also can take some classes as distance learning. this suggest that every schools should have this program, because it is so helpfuly for students who want to graduate from school, but they can't attend school.

online classes also help people who already finish the school, but they want to continue studing and they can take clases online. for example a teacher who have a basic degree to teach,Â but he want to get a master degree. he or she can teach by the they, and he can take his classes online, when he get free time.

in conclusion this opcion is very helpfuly for students , and it is a opcion wich all the schools should have.
