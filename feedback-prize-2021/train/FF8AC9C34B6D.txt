Well in my opinion i think that if you do not have a B average or above you should not be able to play , simply because school is more important than sports when it comes to passing or failing. If you can not play sports and keep up your grade then i don't think you should be able to play. I think it should be the rule" NO PASS NO PLAY"

but that is only my opinion on the subject. It is not that i don't like sports because i do its just that there is no point in having a blast playing if you cant keep your grades up and pass. It would be like this for an example if i was the best football player on the team but i cant keep up my grades well until my grades get pulled up i should be pulled from that class and put in one to help pull up my grades then put back onto that team. On a lot of things i don't agree but on this one i have to agree with the principle that if you cant have a B you should not be able to play. I also don't think you should have to have an A because not everyone is capable of doing that. That is my argument or opinion on it. And i hope that this will be helpful advice to you.
