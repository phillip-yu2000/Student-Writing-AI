It's always nice to have students be apart of their school. Most students love after school or in school activities, for example the football team if this school didn't have a football team students that enjoy football would be mad. Same with every other sport, schools need to have extra activities or they will not be as good as ones that do. Students might want to switch schools if they don't have activities they enjoy, because other schools might have things they enjoy, like sports and clubs.

It will also make their school look better if all students are in a extracurricular activity. It could possibly expand the choices of what students might like too. There are plenty activities to choose from and students should have to at least choose one. Even if it's from cards to basketball it doesn't matter but schools should have students doing something. Schools should have a system to where you can make your own "club" or activity. So then if students don't like what their school offers them then they can make a activity they enjoy.

Making students do after school activities would also bring them closer together. They could meet new people and make more friends. Also it will overall bring the school closer together. Then everybody will know each other and mostly all kids will have friends. It is important for schools to have activities or else nobody would like the school.

This is why schools should have activities because they make schools look better.

They also help students get friends and, finally they help bring everybody closer together. So this is why schools should have extracurricular activities.
