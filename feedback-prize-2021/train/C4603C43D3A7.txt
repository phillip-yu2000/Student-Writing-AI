Dear Principal,

I think this idea could help the school and students a lot.

It would make some students mad and then make them strive to get better grades so they could get go to their after school activity.

Lots of students enjoy having after school sports and activities, and if you only allow the students with a B average or above to join a lot of students would try to get better grades.

It would give them that extra push to maybe try harder or listen better.

Then if they got better grades then they could tell their friends to try to do better too.

This plan could help the school a lot academically.

At first some students would get mad at the new rules and maybe see that only the students with the B average or higher can go.

That would make them want to be on even more.

Then if they get their grades up they would be able to go and maybe try to have their friends come along too.

If enough students grade average goes up to a B then maybe you could try to go up to an B+ or an A.

You could really start to bring up the school's grade average just by doing this.

So I think this plan could help a lot by bringing up student's grade average and letting them play sports when they have a high enough grade.

It could help student's futures and studies a lot.

I hope this helps with your decision
