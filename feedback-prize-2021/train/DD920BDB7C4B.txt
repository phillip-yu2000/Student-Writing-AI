The use of the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom, I feel, would be very valuable. I feel that it would be very beneficial for students and teachers. In the artical it explains that one facial movement can mean you're feeling many different emotions. This could be helpful in classrooms if somebody is feeling confused, the teacher could recognize that and tweak the lesson or help the individual. It could even help show if the majority of a class is having trouble with something so the lesson or subject at hand can be further explained.

Another way facial coding in classrooms could be quite helpful is for students with special needs. For example if theres a student that is confused or frustrated with a topic but does not know how to put that into words, the facial action coding system could help tremendously. Over time i feel like this would be a beneficial tool to have in classrooms for children and teachers.
