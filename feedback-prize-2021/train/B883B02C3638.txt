Should or Shouldn't people use their phones while driving?

What my opinion on this topic is no and the reason why I say this because people (mostly teenagers) can't focus when they have a phone in the car, they will keep using it which causes them to get distracted like for example in a BBC article they estimated that all 6% of car accidents happen because people were on their mobile phones this also means that 12,000 serious injuries and 2,600 deaths each year in the U.S. And on the news on April 8, 2019, a teen who was speeding at 106 mph while on the social media app Snapchat got in a car accident with her friend but because she was paying attention got her friend killed and now that teen will be faced with 15 years in prison and many more like this happened to teens, adults, elders, etc.

Because of them using their mobile phones while driving and not paying attention to the road.

Therefore, I say that people shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving hands-free or not because it causes a lot of accidents each year and if we don't act fast then we will just keep losing the ones we love.
