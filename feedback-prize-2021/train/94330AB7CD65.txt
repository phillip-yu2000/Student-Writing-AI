Dear Principle,

I want your students to do community service, like picking up litter or help someone to do community service.

They could help the planet if they do community service some examples are, picking up litter, recycling, reusing, donating, and reducing some of their stuff from home or from someone's house.

Recycling- you can recycle stuff like any kind of plastic bottles, paper, and glass so that your students will learn community service easier.

Reusing- you can reuse all of storage bowls and dishes that you barely use you and your students can go to like a lake and pick up litter, then they can start reusing some of it.

Donating- the stuff that your students have in their house, that they don't use anymore they can donate it to a really good charity for the poor or for the homeless, or if they have any little brothers or sisters they could get some of their old toys or something that they don't use anymore they could donate it like to a daycare or homeless children.

Reducing- you and your students can reduce about anything that you have in your household.

Littering- your students should not ever litter, because it would give the community some hard work and it would take up most of their social time with their families, so make sure that none of your students never litter any where.

You and all of your students could go to a resort or lake so that they would get the feeling of community workers when they have to clean up litter on the grounds of the resort or lake.

Thanks
