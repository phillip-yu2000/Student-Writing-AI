The electoral college should be stopped. The electoral college takes away peoples rights.

The electoral college takes away from peoples rights. The people of the United States should be the one who decides what our president, not our senators. The votes that us citizens put in should be counted and not the senators votes. In my opinion, it should not matter what the size of the state/population for a number of votes to be put out. In the end we are all a whole. If youre voting for the president, why would you vote for the slate of electors?

A big argument there is, is called the disastor factor. Some electors have refused to vote for a certain candidate. This is why the people should take responsibility and vote. There is also less likely to be a tie if you let the people vote for the president and not the slate of electors. There is an even number of people so there could be a tie at any point. The state population shouldnt depend on how many representatives are given to the House of Representatives.

As to the candidates, they cannot spend time in states they have no chance in winning in. They mostly worry about the 'swing' states because either one could win in it. But it shouldnt be up to the slate of electors, but up to the people.

Maybe one day this electoral college will be abolished, but until then we have to live with it. It should be up to the people and not the states. It is unfair to the candidate and the people of the United States.
