Dear Principal:

The requirement for being able to play a sport or any other extracurricular activities is that the student has to have a B average. I think that this requirement is a good idea because it will motivate the students to want to do better in school. For some students if they raise their grade it will be an accomplishment for them. Test scores may increase and behavior might too. Students will start off the year ready to do well because they will know that in order to play any sport or activity their grades must meet a certain standard.

I also understand that some students might find it hard to keep a B average. That is why I think that the students should be given two warnings. The first warning would tell them to bring their grades up. The second warning would say that if the grades do not improve they cannot participate in any extracurricular activities. Then if their grades did not improve they would not be allowed to participate in any activities until their grades were up to par.

I also think that maybe if the students had a grade in the B range that would be fine. Maybe students would be allowed to participate in activities with a B-. Overall I think that the policy is good and should receive only minor adjustments.

Sincerely
