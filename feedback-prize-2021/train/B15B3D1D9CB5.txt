The author of "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" did a decent job at discussing how studying Venus is worth the time and money. The author discusses intresting topics such as the idea that there were oceans and even life on Venus at one point. Though these would be nice, there are also many dangers listed.

The author makes it very clear that there are many dangers that would come with studying Venus. Some of these dangers are 97% carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, clouds made of corrosive sulfuric acid, 800 degree heat, and atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth. The author then goes on to say that these challenges could be avoided in some ways. A solution the author proposes is an idea made by NASA to make a "blimp-like vehicle" that would let explorers observe in less extreme heat and much less pressure. From there, the author states that solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels, which is immediatley followed by "not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." Though this would make many people think that Venus' exploration is possible, the author then brings up more skeptisism with the ideas of of photography and videography not being effective and not being able to get samples without people touching the ground.

The author had conving points that would make sense for anyone to want to visit mars, but were overshadowed with doubt that it could actually happen. Therefore, the question is raised if it is worth continuing to use millions of dollars and the possibility of losing life to learn what a planet was like in the past which as of now is not capable of sustaining life.
