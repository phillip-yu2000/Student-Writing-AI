Dear Principal,

we should be able to use our cell phones during lunch periods and other free periods because some students have important things to do that is off campus. Like me for instance my mom just had surgery and she is at home by her self and i need to make sure that she is ok. What if something goes wrong or she is trying to walk? If i can't use my cell phone to call or text to find out if she is ok then what i don't want to lose my mom or any of my family members. My family is all that really matters to me. There that i have left. Nothing else matters not friends, boyfriends. The only reason that i need to use my cell phone is because I'm checking up on my family because that and my education is all that really matters to me. So that is my reasoning as to why we should be allowed to use our cell phones when we're not in class. Thank you for listening.

Sincerely your student,
