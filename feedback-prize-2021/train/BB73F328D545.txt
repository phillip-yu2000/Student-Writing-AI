I agree with the passage and encourage that students have their visual expressions checked for their individual emotions. As long as they get consent from them to use such technology on them.

I agree for several examples. One example(although not stated directly in the passage) A counsiler could for example use it on a student if they showed signs of depression or high sadness and properly diagnose it, helping them that they couldn get previously if they kept a fake smile on. Next is because it would help teachers with information on their students is they enjoy their material and what they could do to help improve the material used. Lastly it was stated that it can improve things for video surgerys and video games, showing the expressiveness of human emotion so the game or surgery would be more realistic and relatable.

In conclusion, that is why I agree that this facial/emotional technology would be useful in peoples lives, with things such as diagnosing mental illnesses like depression. Public education improving to adapt more to student preformace and behavior. And lastly that things such as video games and video surgeries could get better facial expression for humans to make the games or informational surgeries more useful to the creators.
