In my perspective, I beleive that when viewing someone's facial, or human emotions it should be visual. I do not agree with the form of technology. By viewing someon's emotions it forms a sense of character which is good with person to person to person with associating with one another. According to the article, it talks about how the process with technology starts at a 3-D computer of the face which is then known to have 44 muscles which then shows the movement of the face to detect the human's emotions. The article continally explains that the facial expressions are what are known to detect the emotions through technology. This ll today is showing you what all a computer can actually do. According to the article they agree on using the technology from what the computer can actually do. In my perspective I think my opinion is the opposite. Your emotions should be detected by another human;s point of view, not by technology.
