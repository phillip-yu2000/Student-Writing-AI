In this article reguarding the chances of humans living or visiting Venus, the author in the does a good job of telling the reader that Venus may have a chance of humans visiting the planet, but not living there because it is too hot. Venus has a lot of Earth like sructures such as mountains, valleys, and oceans. If I was a scientist i would want to study and maybe even see it from outer space because of all its unique features it has. The planet is very closely related to Earth and would be liveable on if it was not so hot there. Venus has storms just like Earth does, like tornadoes earthquakes and thunderstorms. Venus also has very large mountains and craters to go along with them. These features give the planet one of our nearest options to visit, given among the frames of space travel.

Venus can be seen from humans on Earth because of it being the closest planet to Earth and because of how red and bright it is. The planet may not be as big as Earth, but the brightness of the planet makes the planet seem much bigger than it actually is. Scientists from NASA are coming up with an idea to send humans to study Venus. The author states that the scientists' solution is that they will allow these scientists to float above and survey since they would not be allowed to land on the planet because of how hot it is. They could take videos and pictures of the planet circling around it.

Scientists are stiving to try and study Venus and all the value it has. Not just because it has gained insight on itself, but because of all the curiosity that scientists have on the planet. Scientists should not be worried about all the dangers that come with the challenges of visiting or researching the planet from outer space because scientists shoulf expand and meet their expectations of their imagination innovation.
