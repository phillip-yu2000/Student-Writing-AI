In 1976 Viking 1 spacecraft was obiting Mars, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sester ship Viking 2. When it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. This face is actually just a common landform. Scientists have taken several pictures of the "face", and scientist would benefit from These are the reasons why I believe the Mars Face to be a simple landform.

My first reason is the fact that there are similar landforms like it on Earth and Mars. Such as mesas in the American west. One specific mesa is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. There is also several other landforms like it on Mars. The passage states that "Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."

My second reason is that scientists have photographic evidence that it is nothing more than a mesa. April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and His Mars Orbiter Camera team shot a picture ten times sharper then the original photos. Revealing that it was just a natural landform. April 8, 2001, Malin and his team took an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute Maximum resolution. Did you know that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size meaning that if there were objects on the ground we could tell what they were.

Some people might say that NASA would rather hide evidence of life on Mars, but NASA would actually benefit from an ancient civilization. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

These reason are why I believe the Face on Mars is only a natural landform.

There are similar landforms on and off Mars, there is photographic evidence, and NASA would actually benefit from life on Mars.
