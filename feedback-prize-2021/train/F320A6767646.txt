Dear Senator of my State,

Being a citizen of the state of Florida, I dearly wish for the Electoral College voting to no longer continue.

In my state of opinion, we should change the election of voting to the most popular vote for the President of the

United States. I have thought through for awhile that the Electoral College is rather dumb. But of course

I cant just say that and think you will get rid of it, i have to have my reasons of why i think this and share them with you.

First off, when we want citizens to vote, such as my self, we want all of thier votes to count for something.

Not just some little game for you senators to play with. All of our voting need to be included by what we voted in the first place and what we want, thats the whole point of voting. For example, we dont always control whom our electors vote for, that's unfair. Or even worse, we get confused about the electors and sometimes vote for the wrong candidate. Citizens that are voting for a candidate should never be confused on who they vote for. So if i was a State Senator i would stop the Electoral College for good.

There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree. I would state them all but unfortunatly i am running out of time. Just know that i think that the Electoral College is unhealthy and is wrong for our society and it is completly an anachronism. Its NOT hard to say but Bob Dole was right, " Abolish the electoral college! " .
