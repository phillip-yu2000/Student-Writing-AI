Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I would just like to say that I believe that students should have at least a high C average to be able to play sports because most of the school is has at least a C average, and not having sports would not only make students upset but it could also lead to a school wide obesity problem because not only will students become lazy and not get enough exercise but also when kids get upset they tend to eat a lot.

Students grades will also drop because of the weight gain and the need that no longer exist to push, push, push,

themselves to the limit to work until they can't work any harder any longer they won't have that extra little push, to want to keep their grades up and want to work harder. Students will also most likely gain a self esteem problem from the weight gain the neediness and the uselessness they feel for themselves
