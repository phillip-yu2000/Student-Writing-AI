Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think all students should be able to have phones during lunch and other free times but not during class. I think this could be a good idea because instead of sneaking your phone around and getting caught and having to serve a detention you can just do it.

It would be a lot better if we could use are phones during class time to but i understand why you don't want us to cause you want us to pay attention in class. A lot of students would appreciate it if you let us have it at least at lunch and during free time.

If you would like me to i could get a petition and have every guy/girl sign it so you know how much this would mean to us. If you let us do this we will all do better on are grades in school because that means that we don't have to sneak it around in class and not pay attention to the teacher, " And i know you will like it if we do that."

I would love if you let this happen, Actually everybody will love you in the whole school. It would be great for us and for you. Thank you for letting me write you and tell you how much i would appreciate it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
