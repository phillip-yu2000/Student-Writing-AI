People believe that the Electoral College should go, and the writer agrees with them. Watever happened to

"we, the people..."

!? The people are to decide who gets voted in as president, or e. t. c. With the Electoral College in play, "

The Peoples'

" votes mean nothing! ...and that's just no good!

Take the

Gallop pole of 2000

for example! Al Gore, who won the popular vote, but lost the presidency,  because of the Electoral vote. What the Electoral vote/College is, is a system where voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who then elect the president.

"We the people"

dont even get a say in the matter. Which is still no good!

There have been many disasters in the voting system in the past, like the one back in 1960, with Hawaii sending in two state electors

! Allthough arguably the biggest fiasco, back in 2000, was with the formentioned Al Gore vs. Bush campaign.

Now, there are some contradictions in this, thoughts on keeping the Electoral system.

one example of this, is that this rarely ever happens, the most recent being the Al Gore vs. Bush campaign. Another example of a contradiction is locations, from where the candidate is from, like Romney (never thought he'd be mentioned here) having nothing to do with the areas outside of the south, so he would be a bad candidate for the  Electoral College.

Now that both sides of the coin have been adressed, it's time to look at some of the key facts (and some opinions) of the "

Electoral College debate

"; The Electoral College, to some and others, votes for us; With or without the Electoral College, people would still get to vote on presidency, as well as other things; Everyone has their own opinion on the matter, and to get the best result,

"We, The People..."

have to agree on one opinion for the matter at hand.
