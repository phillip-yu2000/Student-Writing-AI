Have you ever thought what is a seagoing Cowboy? A Seagoing Cowboy is a group of people that transports a cattel over seas to another contry. That's why Luke dose it. To help other people.

Luke's friend decided to invite Luke onto a cattle bout. After Luke decided to join the UNRRA and become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke got to travle the world while takeing care of the animals they were transporting. Luke traveled 9 times. That's more than most Seagoing Cowboys. Luke got to see Greece, Europe, and China. He travled across the Pacific and the Atlantic ocean while working as a Seagoing Cowboy.

He would find ways to have some fun while on the boat while he had a break from the animals especially after the animals were delivered. They played baseball, volleyball,and tennis tournaments where the animals were held. they also whittled, read, boxed,and other games.

Luke was glad that he became a Seagoing Cowboy becauseit made him more aware of the peolpe of other contries and their needs.
