Life without cars would be different, would it not? Well that's what the small town of Vauban, Germany is doing. They are doing it in an effort to reduce greenhouse gases. they are also try to get other towns/cities around the world to participate in this "car-free" movement. Here are some ways limited car usage effects the world.

It reduces greenhouse gases. 12 percent of greenhouse gases come from Europe and about 50 percent come from the United States in the car intensive areas that is. if we were to start having limited car usage we could drastically decrease the car emission greenhouse gases by about 50 percent. Paris, France has a partial ban on cars and only lets certain cars drive on certain days which completely cleared out the smog that had been covering the city for a while.

It increases the amount of money the usual gas consumer has. the save a ton of money from not having to refill on gas all of the time. Thus, causing more money to be spent and having the economy increase. It can also cause for the city to start fixing sidewalks instead of roads because not as many people would use the roads as much.

People in the U.S., Europe, and South America are already taking steps to have a cleaner environment. new sidewalks, new laws/bans, and just the gneral public are helping. Will you be one of the people that helps?
