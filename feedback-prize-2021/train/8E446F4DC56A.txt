No, i dont think we should have driveless cars that is a hazoired sitiouions.

Because in that type of thing the driver is not in controle of what so ever the driver has no purpose to be there at all and it can be a very dangerous on there part because like instead of the person controling the car that is his life in his own hands

But say the car is in controle he/she will be putting there life in a computers chip they have to be 100% sure with that in order for it to be ok but i bet 50% of the people won't even care about there own life why you say.

because they will be to busy enjoying there new drivless car what if perhapes the car has a milefuntion on the passenger and it hits a person say kills that person what would you blame that on the person or the car the peron had nothing to do with it why because he/she was to depended on their new drive less car.

You also have to think about the legal lieablitiy with this new found car you have to have a sertain amount of mature level to drive a regular car but a drivless car thats crazy you can fall asleep at the wheel kill sombody and say it was not your fault you can blame it on the people that make these cars thats noun sence what would that .

Family think they will still press charges on you and the people that make because its they fault for the milefunction but yours fault fo not paying attention. It would be madness for all plus what human skills would be requird for this to get purchesed if not any you telling me you would fell 100% comfterable with.

A baby in the front seat of a car not me i surely will not feel safe aswell as comfterable

In concluesion no i think that driveless cars are hazirodes sitiuions.
