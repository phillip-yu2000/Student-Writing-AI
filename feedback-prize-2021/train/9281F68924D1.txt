To the principle,

I want to tell you my opinion on your suggestion about only allowing students with a grade B average or above to participate in sports and other activities. I think that its not the best idea because kids should have the freedom to do what they want and pay the consequences of wrong decisions they make. If a child is doing bad it is usually their choice and they will get a bad grade because of that, so there is no need for extra punishment. Getting bad grades might make them not get as far as they would like to in life, and that will be a wake up call for them to start trying harder in school. Not allowing a child to participate in activities will not make them realize that they need to start trying harder, it would just be an annoyance. I also think it would just make kids possibly get into more trouble out of school because they have nothing else to do after school; if they maybe aren't doing homework now they probably still wont after taking privlidges away from them. I could see why you would want to do this but i don't think it will have much affect. Also it wouldn't be fair to children with learning disabilities because sometimes they can not help it for getting a bad grade. A better idea would be maybe saying if they get academic help after school for at least half an hour, then they can go and do sports and other things the school offers. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
