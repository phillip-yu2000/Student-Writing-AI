Dear Principle,

Hello this STUDENT_NAME and I want you to require community service for our school. I believe that community service is a good thing. One reason why I think you should require community service is that it shows children and young teens good things to do. Another reason why I think you should require community service is that it benefits the community overall and makes things nicer for everybody. Also another reason why I think you should require community service is that it makes everybody much happier with a clean and nice community. Another reason why is that old people or people who are physically disabled may have a easier life with help from the community. My final reason why I think you should make community service required is that it could teach criminal or people who have run into trouble with the law a lesson by cleaning up the community. Thank you and please require community service for our school.

Your Student,

STUDENT_NAME
