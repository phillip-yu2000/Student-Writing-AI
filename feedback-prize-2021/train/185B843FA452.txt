Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that it would be better for students to bring their phones to school and use them during free time and lunch time because it is not disrupting class or it is not bothering anyone either. Now, if they have it on or they are texting during class, you can let the teachers know that they can take them away from us and if we want them back, we would have to come after school and pick it up.

If the texting or using your phone during class keeps on being a problem with the class or with just one kid, you can let the teachers know that they can take it away and turn it in to your office and if we would want it back, we would have to pay whatever reasonable price you want. You can put the price on us according to how we have behaved in the last week, last couple of months, or in the whole year. If we have not behaved so good this past month, you can probably put a higher price on us so that way the student will learn his lesson and not use his phone during class again. Now, if we've behaved good and have not gotten any infractions or referrals, you can probably lower a little the price on us. It is totally up to you.

For example, lets say you warn a kid to stop texting during class and he/she doesn't obey you. The second time you see the kid texting, you may take it away. Now, if this problem continues the next day, you can take it away from him/her and have them pay whatever reasonable price you want. This will teach the student a good lesson because he/her should already know that you should not be texting in class, not just because it's a school rule but because the teacher warned him/her too.

TEACHER_NAME, i do hope you change your mind and let us at least text or use our phones for whatever reasons during lunch, free time, or in between classes when we're walking on the hallways. This doesn't disturb anyone. Does it?

Sincerely,

your student.
