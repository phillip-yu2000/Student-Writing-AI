When we ask for advice, we ask people which are older than us. This is because they have gone through many difficult experiences and don't want us to go through the same experiences they did. It also helps us get different perspectives. For example, when we don't know what to get from Amazon, we ask our parents or any loved ones, to get their opinion. When we don't know a certain subject in school, we ask our siblings for their help, so they can teach us. Seeking multiple opinions from others is a great thing to do because it helps us get different perspectives, and can save us in school.

First of all, people ask others for their opinions, so they can get different viewpoints. Getting different viewpoints help's us make our decision faster. For example, if we don't know what shoe to get, we will ask our siblings or parents to see what they are thinking. From asking our loved ones, we get a different perspective, and this can help us make our decision faster. Getting others opinions can help us make a better decision.

Secondly, getting multiple opinions can save us in school. Some people may be struggling with a certain subject in school and might need help. Getting help from others in this situation can help us pass the class with an A. For example, when we need straight A's, we will ask our siblings, which already went through middle school. They will tell us a few tips and tricks which might save us a scholarship to college. Although one sibling might seem enough, we still need to ask others for their opinions because it might save us a lifetime career. Getting multiple opinions can save us.

In conclusion, we should seek multiple opinions because it gives us different perspectives, and can save us in school. When we get different perspectives, it help's us make our decision faster. It can save us in school, by passing in classes, and getting straight A's.
