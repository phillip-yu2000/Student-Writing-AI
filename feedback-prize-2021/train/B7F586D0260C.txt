Phones & Driving

In my opinion, while you are driving you should not be able to use your phone. You are putting your life in danger as well as others. Phones are a big distraction while driving and if you don't have some type of bluetooth system in your car then you should not be on it. Cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands.

Holding a cell phone to your ear, or having your eyes diverted from the road by logic and common sense the driver is distracted. If an emergency maneuver or emergency braking is needed a driver has a second to react, and a split second to execute the appropriate maneuver to avoid a collision. Picture doing this with a cell phone in your hand. Those who are caught will be issued a ticket by a police officer who will probably be quite perturbed at the driver's ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident. A text message that reads "ok" isn't worth a couple hundred dollar fine.

However, people shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.
