I think if you go to more than one person for advice it can help you a lot more. I think that because if only one person tells you something it doesn't mean very much, but if multiple people give you the same advice then you know more people would choose that too. If one person tells you to do something but 10 others tell you not to do it you're more likely to listen to what the 10 people say instead. Me personally i think it helps to ask more than one person too see what everyone else thinks because people think way different than eachother so most of them are going to have something else to say. When just one person gives you advice they could have to clue what they're talking about and you would probably think they're right because its the only person you have asked. So moral of the story make sure before you do something ask multiple people for advice not just one person! It will really help more than you think it will.
