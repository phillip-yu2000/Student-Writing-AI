First off, I would like to tell you that we have conducted a series of research to prove that aliens did not make this structure, it was just a naturally formed structure. When we first took the picture with the spaceship, Viking 1, we didn't have the best camera strength that we used to take the last picture. This led all of us to believe that it was a face on Mars, and almost everyone sought to it that is was a sign of life on Mars. Soon we just figured out it was another Martian mesa on Mar's surface, nothing special.

When you look at that first picture we took, I could understand that you would believe that it was made by alien life. After slaving over all of the research we had done to prove it wasn't and released it to the press, you still believe it was aliens? Just to make people more happy with the news, NASA snapped another picture with the Mars Global Surveyor. It showed that it was just another NATURAL land form. There was no alien moniment to show. Though not everyone was satasfied with the results.

When they took that photo, The Faces on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. This is a cloudy time of a year on the Red Planet. So people wanted to have a clearer image since the picture had to be taken through a layer of clouds. Finding the Face on Mars wasn't an easy job, but we found it again and snapped a thrid picture in April of 2001. This certain picture showed that it was just another Mesa.

So in conclusion, would you now still believe that this is an alien made structure. After all the research, would you still think that it was a alien made structure? Looking at the photos clearly show that it has only bumps that project the shadows that made the Face on Mars to look like just that, a face.
