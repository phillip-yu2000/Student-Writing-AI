Driverless cars are indeed a thing of the future but are they really practical? We should stick with human operated vehicles instead of computer operated vehicles. If we switch to computer operated vehicles, soon we will no longer teach generations to drive, we will begin to rely on these computers to take us everywhere. This will turn into a problem when something happens to the computer in the car and we are left in a car that we dont know how to drive. Peoples lives could become endangered becasue they are clueless on how to drive. Also, if a person does get imjured would it be the manufacturers fault or the person driving the car manufacturer. Legal battles will erupt and new laws will have to be made. Convenience is also an issue, in order to get from one destination to another you will have to input it in the car, but what if you need to make a pit stop or you get hungry, you have to completely reroute the car and try to find the address of the nearest gas station or resturant. When your driving by yourself you can make those decisicions quickily and you can drive around and look instead putting in a specific location. Driverless cars are not a good idea they will cause confusion and can inconvienent at times.
