Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I honestly think Policy one is a good policy for the reason that we like to use our phones.

The reason i pick policy one is because if you have free time and there's nothing to do you can use your phone to hear music, use it for a calculator , and browse the internet. Also because you never know if there's an emergency going on with your family and what if they call you or text you to let you know what happened. I honestly think we should have policy one in our school's policy. However,

I agree phones should always be put away if the teacher doesn't let you use it.

It would be very cool and exciting if we get to use our phones during lunch time when we have free time. It would be really fun to have it out to hear music and do many things on our phone. I don't think using our phones when we have free time would be a bad idea. I would really like policy one to be one of our policy. I think if we have that policy students would be very happy, excited, and glad to use our phones. Policy one would be a good policy to our school. I myself would honestly like to have policy one i think all the other students would to!

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
