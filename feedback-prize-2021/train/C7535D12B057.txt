There are many different reasons people ask more than one person for advise, one reason is that the person might have a different opinion than the other, the second reason is. You didn`t really trust the person you asked their advise for.

Its always a good thing to have different opinions because,then you can have many options to choose from, with more opinions, the easier it gets, to choose the opinion you think will help you the most. Another reason is that you might not like the advise they gave you because it can`t help with what you`r trying to do. Or it could be bad advise there are giving you, you can tell that their not giving you good advise if you don`t like their opinion or it just sounds like a bad opinion to use. So always make sure you are choosing the advise you think is best for you.

Whenever you go and ask people for their advise make sure you trust the person your asking, if you dont then you could get it trouble, if you follow what they said, for example if someone said to cheat on the test, and then the teacher caches you, then you will be in big trouble. Another reason you should always ask people who you trust, if you ask the people who you trust, it could help you in the future like when your trying to get a job and many other things. The final reason is so that you won`t be in danger when you ask the people you trust, because if you don`t you could get hurt or worse. So always ask the people you trust so you wont be in any danger or get harmed.

So always think about which advise you choose, and who you got the advise from, so you can have the best advise, so it can help you in the long run, and to be safe so you wont get hurt or get into big trouble by your teacher,parents, boss, etc.
