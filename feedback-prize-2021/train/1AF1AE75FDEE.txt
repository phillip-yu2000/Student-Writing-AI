Some people say that "The Face on Mars" was made by aliens but what the face really is a natural landform on the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa also known as landforms that are common around the American West. Martian mesa, are common enough around Cydonia for it to be a resenable answer. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

The reason that the rock formation resembles a human head is bacause shadows. An the shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Sientist only gave it the name "Face on Mars" because, it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The sientist went back to Mars and found the "Face" and took another picture of it on a clear sunny day you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! This shows that "The Face on Mars" is just a landform and that there is no Egyptian alians on Mars. The rock formation just has a wierd shadow on it that gives it the unusual nose,eyes, and mouth formation.
