Natrual land forms are all over earth some looking like common things or objects they of course happen natrualy. So that means other planets have natrual landforms that look like a thing or object such as a face. Nasa has taken scans and pictures using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Meaning they have gotten a full survey of the whole area looking if there was any sign of life that could have created the Mars face. But none were found meaning there is no alien civilization on Mars. It doesn't have to be created by aliens and it probably wasn't but its not wrong to imagine how it was created. But to just know the truth that it is a natrual landform intead of an alien monument. If it was an old alien monument Nasa wouldn't try to cover it up. They would be trying to get funds for taking more trips to actually find more stuff about the mars face instead of taking differnt scans and pictures. This does now say that there are no aliens or any civilization on mars or we would know by now about them.
