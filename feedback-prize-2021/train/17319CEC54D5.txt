Have you evere want to chage whay you were learing becaus you didnt understand it are it just go boring. There is an technology that can help fix thata and it is called the Facial Action Coding System. I think that theis system is a good idea to have in a classroom for students.

In most classrooms there is only one teacher and he/she cant get to every student at the same time. If they implement this system into schools arounld the would then the program can alter it slef for that student tto help him or her to better understand the infromatin they are learning. this system can also he the teacher beetter understand what their student can undersand and what the need to work on.

Another reason this system is good for students is becaus it can benift them when they are learning a new langauge, the systme can aluter the program the student is wourking on to an easer or more diffeclt lesson.

So have you ever want you lesson to change so you can better understand it. the Facial Action Coding System is a good way to sater with. In all this system is a good way for schools to hel their students lean and understand infromather better.
