Yes i am aginst these driverless cars because anything can happen at any certain time like what if the car doesnt alert you if car is coming to close to you or if you are about to get into a crash , You could end up losing your life and they wouldnt know if the car failed or not or if it was just you who did something wrong and the manufacturer would seriously have to deal with some big problems if the car was part of the reason why that person died .

Other reasons why i am against driverless cars is that they dont seem that safe just because you tested just that ONE car doesnt mean any other car you make cant mailfunction either , there is ONLY five known places that are lleagal where you can actally test a driverless car that means every other state or country doesnt mean its safe because its illeagal , I wont believe it till i see its safe because many things could go so wrong , Like what if the car doesnt alert you in time when your trying to back up and you hit a car that would cause serious problems . Also what if there is a crash is about to happen and the car is coming straight towards you and the car alerts you to late what will happen then ? . You could end up dead because the car didnt alert you in time .These cars could aslo be very expensive not everybody could afford one because people are struggling ALOT , the only people who could really probably afford these are millionaires and other RICH people in the world . Even big brand name car comapines like BMW , GM , Mercedes-Benz , Audi , Nissan and even google even though they are not car company they just want to be the first ones to make a driverless car . Those big name brand car companies say that there will be driverless cars by 2020 which is about four years away from now but any thing can happen within fours years .

Nothing will change my mind about these cars unless i have proof that they can make these cars safe and affordable for people even though the JUST ONE car is millions but there main priority should be about the safety for people and they should ATLEAST make a back up system for the car incase something bad happens or if the car loses cointrol they should atleast make a way to make the car to automatically shut off or stop

. so they should really stop worring about the design of the car and start worring about peoples safety.
