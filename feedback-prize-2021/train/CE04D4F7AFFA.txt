Say your in a dilemma would you want one persons opinion or more? Most people including myself would say more. A lot of people think in different ways and have certain opinions on certain topics. It cant hurt to get a second opinion on something either. In this essay I will explain the benefits of getting more then one persons opinion on the problem.

After all why do you think toothpaste companies say 9/10 dentist recommended the tooth paste? It's because the more dentists that agree with it make it more credible. Same thing with getting advice. Lets say you ask that one dentist that says the toothpaste is bad , now lets say you only asked him. Then you would think its a bad toothpaste and in reality its a good toothpaste, however you didnt ask any of the other dentist and stopped after one person.

Just the other day a situation came up and I needed to ask people for advice. The dilemma was whether or not I should wear shorts on Saturday. My brother and I wanted to play outside, however i wasnt changed yet so I told him I would go change. Before I went to get changed I asked him if it was warm enough to wear shorts and he said yes. I wasnt sure so I asked my mom, she said no because it was gonna be windy. Just to make sure I asked my dad and he said to wear pants because of the wind. They where right if I would have stopped asking after my brother I would have been cold.

We make hundreds of choices everyday. From whether we should hit that snooze button or wake up. These choices we make will make us into who we are. We need to make sure we are making the best choices we can make. Asking multiple people about a topic will not only bring us closer to that person but also help us make good decisions.

So I hope after reading this essay you will know now to ask multiple people when you need advice. The more opinions you here about the topic the more knowledgeable you are about the topic.
