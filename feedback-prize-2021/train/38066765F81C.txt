I'm more for the driverless cars than against it. Although there will never be a fully driverless car because you'll always need a person to tell it where it's going, or etc, I like the idea of it. It could help us so much more in the long run.

Driverless cars could prove that we're moving into the future. We could be saving ourselves money from digging underground to find fuel. The new driverless cars could be electric, therefore, making us able to completely discontinue looking for fuel. We could also be making the world safer by having an alert system for if the human driver gets distracted while driving. They also mentioned having a touch sensor on the wheel to make sure the human driver is paying attention. Driverless cars could be a step into the future for everyone.

Driverless cars can have their bad sides, but it's nothing that can't be fixed overtime. Look how far we've gotten already. I think driverless cars are a great idea and we should continue the good work.
