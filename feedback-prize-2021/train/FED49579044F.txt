The Facial Action Coding System,can read peoples expressions.

Should this technology be used in classrooms to detect the emotins of the students?

This technology should not be used to detect the emotions of students. The article stated that this tech, could be used to detect when a student is getting tired or bored of the lesson. This would then allow the computer to liven the lesson up, as the text states directly, "Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor." This line makes it seem like it(the FACS technology) would replace teachers in the classroom.

Teaches do not need technology to tell if their students are bored, as the text says, people just know what the emotions of others are. The teacher would know when, and how to modify the lesson to keep their students interested, and engaged. Would we know what the technology would do to modify the lesson? Would the students just be able to be angry at the lessons until the computer just stops giving the student lessons? Using this tech is not an alternative to having a real person tell how you feel. The teacher can help you feel better because they know how you really feel, because they have empathy. The computer can tell how you feel, but it does not what it is like to feel, so in the end it can't really help.

Should the FACS tech be used in the classroom? No, because the students need a teacher to help them feel better when they are frustrated or sad, not a computer that can only try and make them happy. It also seem sthat they want this tech, to replace our teachers,which would hurt the students more than it would help them.
