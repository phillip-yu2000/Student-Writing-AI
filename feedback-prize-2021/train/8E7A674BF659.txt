Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that changing the school policy is not a good idea. Because if you really want to be in sports and you have a grade C. They wont be able to play because you have to have to have a grade B. So i don't think its fare to the students that really want to play sports but cant because the most maintain a b average. So in my opinion we should have a C average. I think that's maintainable. so please TEACHER_NAME can we at least have a 75 or above to play in sports. Because if you have a 80 or above most students will probably not be able to play because they have a 75 or a 78. Because i have at least a 79in my math class and i was really hoping that i could play sports but mow i cant because you must have a B average in your class. So on behalf pf the school we ask you to pleas not change the school policy. Thank you for taking you time to read this letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
