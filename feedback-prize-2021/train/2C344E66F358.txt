Dear, principle

I believe that all students should not be required to perform community service. it destroys our rights as citizens of the united states and it will feel like a punishment for students that will not like to do it. You can not force upon the student to do community service because if they wish not to do it then you will see a lack of effort from them regardless. Instead of forcing the students to clean the litter and all the things you would like for us to do, how about you just encourage us to make sure that we are not doing these things.

Community services is not mandatory so why would we have to do community services if we wish not to. If you put a student in community service that does not want to do it then they wont do as good of a job has you will expect, so why force it on them, just encourage to pick up litter and all those things. Helping the community is very important but why does it have to mean to destroy our rights as a citizen of this country. Believe that i do know where you are coming from i just think that it is a bad idea for our student that wish not to perform community services. That is why I Think that all students should be force to do community services.
