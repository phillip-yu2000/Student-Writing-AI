Too many children, parents, and friends are lost each year from vehicle related deaths. Drunk driving is among the top leading causes of car accidents. Phones and technology play a big part in distracting the driver creating opportunities for a crash to occur. If driverless cars are put into use, the amount of wrecks caused by drivers fault will decraese greatly

Alcohol can cause an impaired driver to get behind the wheel and drive to the next location they have in mind. It is too often that drunk drivers crash into innocent people in another car creating death among the innocent. With google cars, the impaired car owners can sit back and leave the driving up to technology. The sensors and cameras installed about the car create a much better chance in preventing an accident instead of relying on an impaired driver's vision. In some sections of roads, the driver will have to take the wheel, but as technology advances, there will no longer be a need for human control of vehicles.

Getting a phonecall or text while driving discovers the oppotunity of distraction which leads to car accidents. The sensored braking system installed within Google cars will do a great job in decreasing the number of pedestrian and animal related deaths due to distraction of the driver. You can almost always find animals lying alongside the roads due to the driver's inability to brake or swerve fast enough. Google cars cameras will see the animals long before the driver can which prevents the loos of an animal and the destruction of a vehicle.

Google cars may have difficulties and faults but over time they will advance and problems will be solved. Preventing drunk driving or technology related deaths will cause friends, family, and children to stay within the lives of their loved ones longer. This decrease in worry will also create more opputunities to focus on other top people relating deaths and their preventions.
