Dear Principal,

I think policy 1

is the better policy 2 because if you allow students bring phones to school lunch will be less noisy and students will always have something to do during free time and less students will get in trouble for sneaking texts or calls since they will have a time to do it.

If you allow cell phones lunch will be less noisy because everybody will be busy texting instead of talking loudly and goofing off. Lunch would be a lot better off if we had cell phones because there wouldn't be a lot of auguring because everybody's texting instead of getting in to dumb arguments.

If you allow cell phones at school students will always have something to do at free time. teachers will never have to send students to there lockers to get something to do they can just pull out there phone and surf the web or text. There will no longer be a student sitting at there desk doing nothing.

Also If you allow cell phones at school there will be less lunch detentions given out for student getting caught texting during appropriate times. There will be very few detentions for students because most detentions are because students text during lunch or home room.

So if you would dear principal please consider policy number 1 over 2.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
