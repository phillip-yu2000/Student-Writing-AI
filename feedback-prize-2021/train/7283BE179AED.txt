In the past few years, cellphones have become a major use of communication for many people. Cellphones has become a major issue in the field of driving. Many people drive while they're on the cellphone. The use of cellphones while driving should be banned. I say this because there have been 60-70% of drivers that have died, crashed due to the fact that they are using their cellphones while driving.

To begin with, the use of cellphones while driving should be stopped. In the last few years there have been many car crashes because people are all into their phones when they overall focus should be driving. At times cellphones can be of good use. But not all the time. People use cellphones to help them get to and from but they shouldn't be used all the time.

According to the law of Tennessee, "banning hand-held cellphone use while driving takes effect July 1". "Beginning July 1, the drivers could face a major fine up to $200 for using their cellphones while driving". This should be banned in the state of Georgia, because the drivers don't realize how much damage they're causing when they are on their cellphones.

In conclusion, cellphones should be banned. They should not be used while driving. If people want to avoid getting into accidents they should stop using their phones while driving. If there weren't any accidents the world would be a safer place. Having cellphones can be of good use as well. But only if people use them that way. Making a phone call while driving can be dangerous as well. Making phone calls aren't always that important. So therefore banning cellphones while driving could result in a better solution.
