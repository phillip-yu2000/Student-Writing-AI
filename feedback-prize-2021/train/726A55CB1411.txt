I don't really think that it should be required to take community service, because people aren't always the cause of liter, polutants, biohazards,

etc in their own community, however, if people would like to volunteer to help out in their community and get graded on it by the school then I would be open to the idea of that. People shouldn't be forced to do things they don't want to do. That's the only thing i have against this. Even though it would be benificial to the community. I would say let the kids that get detention and do bad stuff help with the community, to give them something to do outside of the detention room. Students that are proven avid literers should be held responsible for their own actions. But also another reason why I'm against this idea is that most citys pay a crew to drive around town, water plants, clean town monuments, pick up liter, etc. this could potentially take away their jobs. A great reason why the idea is good is it helps give the students a sence of responsibilty, and helps them know what work is about at an early age. Plus it gives the school a reputation as being good and caring for the community. But that isnt always what its about and the students should have an option to. It would be great assistance to the community though, teaching students how to keep things the way they should stay, clean. And give them a sence of respect to their own community. Right picture, Wrong idea. Now tutoring other students is another thing, students arent always open to the idea of helping other classmates with their work, but others are, again, being graded on volunteering would be fantastic for some of the helpful students.
