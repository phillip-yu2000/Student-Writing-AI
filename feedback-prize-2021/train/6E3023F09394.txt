Dear Principal,

I think that the students in this school deserve to participate in school sports or other activities no matter the grades they have in school. I Think that the students should be able to play school sports and other activities no matter the grade they get because they should be able to have fun and play after a long day at school. I also think that it should be the parents decision if there kids have good enough grades to be able to play school sports and other activities. Some of the kids that go to this school cant help the grades they get it might not be there faults, they might have a disease like a A.D.D or something else that prevents them from reaching there full potential and not being able to learn like the other kids and i don't think that they should be punished when its not there faults. Also some kids might not have a way to get home after school and need to stay at an after school activity until there parents are able to pick them up and if they have under a B average and cant do after school activities then they will have no way of getting home. I hope that you will take my view of this into consideration, thank you.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME.
