In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile," the author describes how a new technology enables computers to identify human emotions. The invention of the Facial Action Coding System lets us read human emotions better than we do now, but is it valuable in a classroom?

In my opinion having a Facial Aciton Coding System in our classes would not be our number 1 priority, for example getting better access to wifi servers that would allow us to use our computers for projects on google without it crashing. In the other hand in paragraph 6 when the author stated "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor." I really liked that idea, because it could help out some students whose strengths may not be in that subject. In my case, that could help my me on better understanding my Geometry homework, but my computer would end up crashing and the whole purpose of the experiment would be destroyed. There is another thing we could do also, we could refer back to what we used to do and just ask our teachers to help us. We do not need a computer to explain the lesson better, I have seen there are a lot of visiual learners who have questions in my class and I don't think the computer could talk back to them and give them an answer they want to hear.

In conclusion, while the idea of having a machine identify your emotions sounds cool and fun, it would not be an essential to the classrooms it would just save us money to refer to the system we use today, which is to jsut ask our teacher.
