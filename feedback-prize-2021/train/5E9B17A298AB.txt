I don't beleive that the use of this technology to read student emotions is of any value to help students in the classroom.

There a few reasons why I have this opinion. I simply don't believe the technology is accurate, not becuase it cannot detect the emotion, but more so our facial expression dont alwyas exactly match the way we feel.

The text says that, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", Dr. Huang Predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." I disagree with this statement because facial expressions are not always reliable. There are times when I look irritated or mad when in reality that is just my natuaral emotionless face. So if this were to be true, and my computer just automatically updated my lesson because it saw that I looked bored that wouldnt be fair. It would actually throw me more off course then help me. Another reason I feel its not a good idea is because in reality majority of students barely just smile and look happy while doing work, it's just something we don't do. So how would the computer be able to accurately know if we were interested if we dont clearly look interested?

So, therefore I believe that new computer technology to read emotions isn't really a big help to students in the classroom. The resuts may not be as accurate because we don't always look the way we feel.
