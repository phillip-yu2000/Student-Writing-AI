Dear Mrs.

,

I think that you should go with the first policy. The first policy could work very easily and a lot more students would like it. You should consider maybe having a recording sheet of students that have been caught for using their phones in classes and have teachers check to see if students phones are off. Another compromise is every teacher could have a basket that students put their phones into at the beginning of a class.

The second policy is taking the fact that you don't want students using their phones in class too far. Not letting a student have their phone at school is extremely unfair, a student might have to call a parent or a parent might have to call a student. either way not letting students have cellular devices is not fair and is outrageous.

You also have to think about the students who don't have cell phones. Both of the policy's would not effect them at all. but what about all the kids who always turn their phone off before class? the second policy would be extremely unfair to them. they always follow the rules and do what they are supposed to do, and now even thou they have always follow the rules you are still deciding over if you should let students use their phones.

I do not agree at all with the idea of you choosing what we should do. The students are the people looking for an education and i think that we should have a school vote on which policy we should follow. Put yourself in our shoes and see how it would be. You always follow the rules and you always do the right thing but when something like this comes up you get the third degree. You are letting a few students ruin something that is precious to almost all. I very much think that you should read and reread my letter ma'am and i letter that you will make the right decision.

Thank you for reading

Sincerely,
