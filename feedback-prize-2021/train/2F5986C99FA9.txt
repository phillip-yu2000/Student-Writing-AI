"The Challenges of Exploring Venus" is an artical about how Venus is a close neighbor yet incredibly hard to study up close. The author suggest that is is worth the risk needed to study Venus and he had some compeling arguments. after reading this ask yourself would you take the risk?

Venus is a very extrem environment, with temetures that can melt tin. it is so extream that no space craft had survied more than a few hours on the surface of Venus. The planet had an atmospher of mostly carbon deoxide and is rittles with cloudes of sulfur. Despite all of that the author still belivews we should continue to explore Venus.

on of the authors key pointts was "...once have been the most earth-like planet inour solar system." The auter went on to say "Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth."

I belive this is a great reason to explore Venus more deeply, because if it has any truth to it why is the planet so deadly now? we should lookinto its past and make an understanding of what happend to Venus so we know what could happen to us and possibly even try and prevent it.

The author concluded thier artical by saying "striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also,because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." i belive this is the authors main point, not just that we should know more about the planet but that it keeps us sharp and provieds problems to slove. The human mind is curious and will alway want to "know how it works" or "whys it do that" and if we dont presue those questions then we are learning nothing.

So in conclusion althoghVenus is an extream environment we should explore it more deeply. We should try to find ways to do so. the author gave many points but his best one was simply that the peopel are curious and want to know so show us.
