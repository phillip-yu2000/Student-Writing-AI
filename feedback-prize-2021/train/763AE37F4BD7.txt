Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with the decision you took for changing the grade average to participate in sports or other activities. There many reasons on why I disagree with your decision. First, our athletic students in our school are not smart and usually get C' s on their report card. If you change the grade average, those students won't be able to participate in school sports. If the school's athletic students can't play then the sports department will suck and be awful. A awful sports department will look bad for our school and cause other schools to insult our sports department. Would you like that? Another reason is that a C average is a decent grade. It is way better than a D or a F. Our school district says that a C and above is passing. So why can't the grade average to participate in sports be C? Thirdly, many students in our school have C average and if you change it to a B average, then not many students could tryout for sports and less students trying out won't give the coaches to many students to choose from. In some sports, less students will tryout and then that sport won't have a full team. Lastly, changing the grade average to a B will cause hatred from the students towards you. Will you like having students upset and angry at you? I hope you understand my point of view and take the correct decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
