How often do you ask for advice? Do you ask more than one person? Maybe you should. When seeking advice some people ask more than one person. It is always in your best interest to seek multiple opinions to better your final decision. You should always ask more than one person for advice because you want the best possible answer and you don't want to make an irrational decision.

For an example, you go to your "crazy" friend Generic_Name for advice on how to deal with something at your job. Generic_Name's advice to you is to just quit. You then go to your mom and ask for advice, her advice is to talk to your manager about it and if that doesn't work go above your manager. If you didn't go to your mom after Generic_Name you would have been without a job, but with your moms advice you have the chance to still keep your job and work the situation out. As a result, you got the best advice possible. We may not always want to go to your parent for advice, but those are the more seasoned people that can have the best advice for you.

Next, we can all be in the heat of the moment state where you just want to punch someone or something and/or cause a scene, but if you ask for advice from a person that wasn't in the situation you will get a more calm response. You will have the opportunity to hear a better decision so nothing gets out of hand.

In conclusion, asking more than one person for advice works out better because you get the best possible response and you don't make an irrational decision you might have before hand. You will be able to get a better outlook on the situation and understanding as to why you should handle it in a better way.
