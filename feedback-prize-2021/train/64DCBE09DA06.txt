Your trying to visit a new city. You have spent countless hours on a plane and first thing when you land you find out that you have to stay in the airport even longer just due to the fact the the smog outside is too bad. We must limit are car usage.

Therefore showing us the advantages of doing so. Source 1 - in a place called Vauban, Germany they have said there goodbyes to cars. As driveways and home garages are mostly forbidden. The outcome has familes saying 'when i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way'.

Also earth is are home. Why would should we all sit back and see are selfs destroy everything we bulit. The more cars we have and use the more damage we do on the earth. Cars have a huge part in the earths greenhouse gas. In Europe greenhouse emissions are up to 12%. In the United states greenhouse gas emissions are up to a bone crushing 50%.

Source 2 - Due to all the greenhouse gas after almost record breaking pollution, Paris had to do something about the smog. They set a law that only even numbered license plates were allowed to leave there home on mondays and odd numbered on the next day. That may have lead to some problems such as late to work...ect. But after five days the smog was down 60%.

We all have are reason to useing a car,truck,ect. but too much use can lead to problems that we are faceing right now. Best parts of not useing a car are workingout by walking or bikeing. Less smog. More money in the bank.
