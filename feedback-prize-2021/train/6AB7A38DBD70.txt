People sometimes ask more than one person for advice on hard decisions. How can asking multiple people for advice help someone make the right choice? I think getting advice from more than one person is helpful because they'll have different peoples opinions.

Receiving more advice is very useful, because one person could of been in the same situation your in and the other person could just know the right thing to do. The person that has been in the situation before could have did the wrong, and messed up something then you seek ideas that they give you to do the right. On the other hand the person such as your parent gives you advice knows more than the person you asked before because they been on the earth longer and seen bad things happen. Advice from multiple people is useful to put all their ideas, and or opinions together to make your own good decision.

Seeking advice from all different basketball coaches, and trainers is very good because they'll have lots of their own opinions. Generic_Name from Generic_School could tell you, "Need to work on moving without the ball", but your high school coach tells you that "You need to work on, on the ball defense". One trainer could say "You got to work on your jump shot off the dribble a little more, but another trainer says "Your jump shot is fine, but you have to improve your handles." Trainers can give you ideas on what college you choose to go to when the decision comes down to that.

People ask for more than one person for advice why do people do that? I think that's a good idea to do because you learn from people. Won't make the same mistakes that they have did. People can tell different stuff you need to work on if it's sports, school, or being yourself. All advice is good.
