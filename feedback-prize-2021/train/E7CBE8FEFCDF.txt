When you go to seek advice sometimes only using advice from one person isnt always the best. So its better if you go to multiple people for advice because people see things differently and have different ideas and that can help you formulate your own advice.

Not everyone has the same idea and thats okay. Especially when your looking for advice. When you listen to others advice it can help you formulate your own advice. As the old saying goes "Two heads are better than one". So its better to have multiple friends to help you with advice rather than just one.

Another saying is "Not everybody sees the light in the same way". meaning not everyone sees things the same way. By using this to your advantage you can think about how your friends might see your problem you need advice for differently. Sometimes your friends might not have the smarts piece of advice to give you and thats okay just dont take there advice.

Once you take all your friends advice into account you can start to formulate your own advice by piecing all of your friends advice together. This can help you feel secure about the advice and to make sure it doesnt sound dumb. once you do that take your own advice and solve the problem your having. Then you will know how to solve a problem like that again multiple pieces of advice are helpful because they can help you formulate your own advice, see the advice from different angles, and get different ideas. once you master this you can help out your friends when they need advice. You can also help yourself next time.
