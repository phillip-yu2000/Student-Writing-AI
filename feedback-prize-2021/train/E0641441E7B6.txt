Opinions From People Matter

When asking for advice, people may think "Well I really don't trust that person." , "Their culture may say different from what I believe." or they may think "That person has gone through more than other people." . So, I believe we should go to one and other to seek advice because of different personal opinions,different trust levels, and how there culture may handle it.

My first reasons is, many people have different aspects of certain situations because they might have went through it. Also, people may say you should do one thing but, they may have an other opinion for someone else because it may be different then your situation. Like when I had to tell my dad I lost my watch, I asked several people if I should tell him or not.

In our world today people have made it hard for people to trust one and other. So, if you don't trust one person you may not seek for their advice as you would seek for friend or family. Although, someone may trust one and other doesn't mean they would agree with their opinion. For an example, I wouldn't go up to someone I don't trust or like and ask them " Should I dye my hair blue.".

My last reason is, they're many different cultures, which means they may say " Well you shouldn't be gay, thats what we believe in." because thats their culture that they grew up around. Because or their culture, there might be a good reason why they said it or why their cultures believes in it.

In conclusion, you always can seek advice from several people because of culture aspects, different trust levels in some people, and because of different personal opinions.Â
