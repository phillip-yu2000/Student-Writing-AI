Being bored in the middle of class really sucks. You sit there staring at your computer screen longing for the time to go by faster. Well with the new Facial Action Coding System it can read your emotions from your face and change things up a bit. These are very good for classrooms to keep kids from getting bored and going off track.

When I'm sitting in class I don't like to be bored the whole time. I want to learn and pass, but I can't do that if I keep spacing out or falling asleep while doing my work.

I want to be entertained and interested in what I'm supposed to be learning. If my computer had the Facial Action Coding System installed in it then when I began to get bored it would notice and would change the lesson or how it was teaching me.

In conclusion, I believe that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for classrooms to have to keep students from getting bored and not doing their work. It would help them learn and keep them interested in the lesson. This would help students pass and keep them going for a better chance for a good career with a better education using this system.
