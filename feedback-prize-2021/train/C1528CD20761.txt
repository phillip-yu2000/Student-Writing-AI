Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is definitely a very important thing all over the United States. We must keep our environment clean, healthy, and looking nice for whoever's eyes it draws. Not only that, but helping out young children at elementary schools, gardening over the city, and more help really makes a person feel good and accomplished. Although community service should be mandatory to some people, I believe it should be an option. No one should be forced to clean the city, but if they wanted to, they absolutely could.

To begin, a principal shouldn't make all students provide community service, it should be out of wanting to. For that reason, I think the students that help around the city, schools, etc. should be somehow rewarded. Not everybody wants to take time out of their day to help the environment, and I don't think it would be right if they were forced to either. I'm not saying nobody should help out, I'm just that we should do it out of our own will. It takes personal time away from being with our friends and family while we're not at school, and doing other activities with the ones we love. That is time that shouldn't be taken away from what a principal just decides to do. Like I mentioned, students should be rewarded for their actions of community service because if nobody else is doing it, at least they are. That shows care and responsibility for where they live and who sees it.

To conclude, it surely would make the world a beautiful place if principals required community service to all students. It just wouldn't make all the students and parents happy for reasons such as personal time being taken away, and more. It would be pointless then. Otherwise it is great, it just should not be a required thing.

Sincerely,

Your student, STUDENT_NAME
