I had alot of adventures when i rode over seas to support the army. One time I injured my self and i tripped and slid cracking my ribs. In the outcome, sailing was alot of fun. Im glad i was there with my friend or I wouldn't of made it, because he kept me going. Finnaly I suggest everyone try out being Seagoing Cowboys.

During my first trip I left August 14 1945 with cows, goats, supplies, and weaponry. It was a dangerous trip but we kept pushing because the army needed supplies. When we arrived the Pacific war ended but another was still blazing. The old war ended in ruins and bodys.

The UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabitation Administration) created this idea of taking supplies over seas. Many didn't sign up, but me and Don did and turns out it was alot of fun. On the return we played alot of sailing games to pass time. when we delieved the supplies there were no animals in the ship so we had time to setup thing like whittling, table-tennis, and boxing, but theres alot more, like fencing.

The sights in Europe are amazing there's China and The Great Wall of China. In Greece theres the Acropolis. I also took a gondala to Venic, Italy. I also toured a castle in Crete. Finnaly I marvelled at the watery canels in Panama. In the end i saw alot of crazy things in Europe and China.

After my trip I can say it was amazing and you can have the same experience. Just sign up for Seagoing Cowboys. There's animals so if you like animals there on the boat. If your althelic you can help care to the animals and play the return games. If you love water, well we are on a boat and you can fish. After all no matter what you passion is I suggest you sign up and try Seagoing Cowboys, see you there!
