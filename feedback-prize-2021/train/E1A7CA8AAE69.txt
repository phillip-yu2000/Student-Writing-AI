I don't think community service is needed or required especial for school because that should be able to choose if you want to do that our not. It is help for to the world and if every one does it and can help earth but a lot of people don't have the time to do that some people have work or outside school activities and that can get in the way of doing community service. also the little free time that some people have they want to spend it on there self. Not on doing some thing that requires more work because than that person can get stressed out.

I think some people should do it like the people that don't really have any thing to do in there life, or the people that have a lot of free time. Because that will have them busy once in a wile. also doing can give you better mental health by you caring about things like the earth and wanting to help out with people.

Well going back to having the principle making kids have to do community service. I think that is not needed for kids because it will give them stress if they really don't want do it. And some kids that are bad that are forced to do this might make mess even more to try to feel cool because he is doing community service or he might knock down garbage cans and stuff like that. Also if the school was to add community service they should make it so its optional and you participate they should be rewarded because than more kids will do it and the school would get what they wanted.
