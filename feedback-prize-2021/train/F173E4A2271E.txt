Dear Principal,

I don't think it's a very good idea to require at least a B average to participate in sports.

If you do this, I think many people who may not be as smart will not do sports or other activities.

I think everyone should be able to be in sports.

As long as the students aren't failing, I think they should be able to do activities like this.

This plan may want kids to try harder in school.

Maybe if they know they don't do as well as others, they'll try harder in order to be in sports.

I also think schools shouldn't make people get better grades to play sports.

As long as the kids stay on top of their homework and get a C average, they should be able to play sports.

I don't think the kids' parents will be happy to know that there kid has to have a B average in order to participate in after school activities.

The parents will have to help their children with homework.

In conclusion, I don't think it is a good idea to require at least a B average to participate in after school activities.

Kids may just not do them anymore if they know they have to have a certain grade to participate in things.

The school is telling them they have to do better in order to do sports.

You can't make kids do better in school.

Maybe you can schedule something after school with your teacher in order to get a higher grade.

Some kids will do anything to play sports.

Also, parents won't be too happy to hear they have to help their kid with homework so they can play sports.

Overall, I think it's a bad idea to require at least a B average to participate in activities.
