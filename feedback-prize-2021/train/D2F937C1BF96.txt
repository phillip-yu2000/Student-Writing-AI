In my personal opinion I would say that the technology to read other people emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not a good valuable. The Facial Action Coding System wouldn't be a good valuable because why would school bother buying the Facial Action Coding Sysytem for their student just to check if they happy or not. Instead of buying Facial Action coding System they should buy school material,books or even online websites for kids to learn,because kids really wouldn't like a computer checking them out if they are happy or sad.

Students wouldnt like to go to school knowing that almost everyday that there going to check their emotions. Everyday there are people that go to school sad,depressed,happy, and exited and those people dont wat to tell other people how they feel like. Even if those people try to fake smile theey wouldn't get away without it because in the article it say's "In a false smile,the mouth is streched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a "smiling" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. So this means that it can detect a fake smile because of our face muscle called orbicularis pars palpabraeus.

Even though it's kinda a cool invention but it shouldn't be for students or schools because sometime students want to fix here emotion by themselve or sometimes they don't want anyone to see that person emotion. My own opinion the Facial Acting Coding System should be used in places like in therapy or somewhere just related to behavior but it wouldn't be a good value in a school.
