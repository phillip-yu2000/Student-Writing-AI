People always need advice for problems they have, But sometimes they don't just go to one person some go see more then one person which sometimes a good thing however the person takes it.

There are people who go to a specific person who understands them, They go to that person because they feel comfortable with telling them about the problem they need advice on. People usually just go to one person because either they're really close to them or they give good advice for the problems they have.

But there are people who take advice from multiple people, They take advice from different people because the more advice the different outcomes you would get on your situation. Some people will give bad or good advice if you think about it, Its good to hear from other people because they will tell you somethings you didn't think about before.

If you take advice from just one person its only one outcome, But if you take advice from different people the more outcomes the better because different people give you good advice it will boost your confidence even if it backfires with confidence the different people gave you it wont't affect you that much so it better to take different people for advice.

So if you wanna take someones advice its better to take it from multiple people to get a perspective on how things would go, the more advice you get the more you see into your problem or problems you have.
