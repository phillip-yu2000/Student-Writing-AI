Dear Principal,

I believe that getting physical activity is very important in a young adults life and should not be completely taken away from children during school hours. Being in a sport shows school spirit, keeps kids in shape, and give them some time to have fun. Studies show students who participate in sports and get regular physical activity do better in school.

Some kids have a hard time paying attention in class, or just have a hard time learning in general. I personally do not think that you should take away ALL sports privileges if a student shows effort in their work but is still not getting the grade needed to participate in a sport. Instead try talking to them about why they are struggling in class, and what you could do to help them ; or you could try making them sit out for a certain amount of games. This way you are still taking away the privilege but not making them stop playing the sport all together.

For many students it is hard to maintain a B average all year, in every class.

For some students, a sport allows them time to be with their friends, kind of like their social time. Although you should not spend the whole time standing around talking to a friend, for some students it is the only time they get to see them. Sports will also improve team work, and teach kids how to get along with each other and work as a team.

In conclusion I do not feel that taking away sports privileges from any student who has below a B average is a good idea. I hope you consider my thoughts on this topic.
