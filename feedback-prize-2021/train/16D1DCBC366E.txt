Dear principal,

I believe that we should be able to have are cell phones because believe it or not they do let us know important things to. The importance of cell phones is that we can be alerted if anything bad were to happen via call or text. Say at lunch you were to turn on your phone and get a call or text that someone in your family has bean hurt and you need to head home immediately, if you did not have you're phone you would not have gotten that text and that would be trouble for you and perhaps the family member.

Cell phones have become part of everyday life for kids in modern times. They are convenient and allow one to quickly send and receive news. As stated they can alert you to harm but also can alert you to when something is happening or should happen. I myself find great use for my cell phone, I use it to know when to take my pills which occasionally lands on school time. Other kids might use them so know when to do other thing like call home to make sure someone does something like say staying in bed if they are sick.

Some may think a cell phone will cause problems in class but if a kid gets caught, probably just chatting because they are bored, just confiscate the phone make the parent come to pick it up. There are many cons to having cell phones in school. All though, they can be solved by different disciplinary tactics, like detention. Wall you may have problems thinking of how to solve everything, I promise you, there is a way to fix each problem. For example someone thinks that if they can text answers to someone taking a test but you cant find them, take the kid taking the tests cell phone away, Or vise versa you could take the person texting the answers phone away, simple right.

For you to consider,

You're favorite student
