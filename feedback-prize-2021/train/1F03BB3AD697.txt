My personal opinion is to keep the Electoral College.  So far, this process has worked out for us and I don't think we should change it.

One reason I think we should keep the Electoral College is the "certainty of outcome".  Most of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.  Sometimes, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.  It is hightly unlikely to have a tie with this system also, because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.

Another reason I am in favor of the Electoral College is that no region can get enough electoral votes to elect a president.  A candidate has no reason to campaign in only his or her region alone; they can spend more time in other places instead of relying only on electoral votes.

I also believe that we should avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins the majority vote.  The electoral vote declares the winner in that case.

Some people seem to agree that we would be better off without the Electoral College.  They argure that it is "unfair, outdated, and irrational".

All in all, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College for the United States.
