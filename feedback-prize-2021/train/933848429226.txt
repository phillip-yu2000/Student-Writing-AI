Dear Principal,

Considering a policy change for students to achieve a grade B average before they are able to participate in school activities such as basketball, baseball ,and other activities is a ethical proposal.

In most schools, children dream of becoming athletes with a colossal amount of fame, but the only obstacle they need to overcome is their poor averages in their overall classes. Children need to realize that they aren't going to get a scholarship to major athletic colleges unless they succeed in their classes. They need the education of those classes to pass major exams in their future careers. When they advance in life they will need to pass iq test ,or a drug test during their life, but they wont succeed because of their education.

One kid might become the worlds most famous baseball player with a humongous amount of money and lose all that money in a instant due to the fact that he or she was scammed, robbed or, blackmailed due to the fact that he or she did not receive the proper education they were supposed to receive, because they were too caught up in sports.

The message i am trying to expose in this passage, is that the principal should enforce students to receive higher grade averages to advance in their future careers.
