I agree with the use of this technology to read emotions expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because the way you will know weather the student is suffering from something. Been treated good or bad. You will know how the student is doing in life by asking questions after you see the results of the Facial Coding System. you will know if the student is happy by seen how hes nerves stretches when where they stretch to. If he raises hes lipsat the corners of hes mouth. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (crows feet)at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes.

If you do the you will look happy if you look at your face in front of a mirrior and making the face will also help you feel happy. Teenagers be going through a lot of dreppesion and unhappy times so i think it will be a great idea to do use this technology in school. To keep them from trying to suicide or know whats up with the kids life. You will be available to help him/her and even save a life.
