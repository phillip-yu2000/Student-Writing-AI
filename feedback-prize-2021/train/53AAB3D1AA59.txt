Have you ever heard of or saw the "Face on mars"? In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacescraft was circling the planet and taking pictures ,as usual, when it noticed what seemed to be a human face. When the photos were released many people were impressed while others believed that the "face" is evidence of life on mars. Scientists believe that this is just a natural landform. If this was evidence of life on Mars it would have been a great benefit to NASA.

When NASA unvieled the photos of the "face" on Mars critics believed that this was proof of life on Mars and that NASA would want to hide this information.

Defenders claimed that this theory was invalid because life of Mars would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide it? To further their claim that the "face" didn't prove life on Mars NASA decied to take more HD pictures of the landform.

In 1998, NASA took picture of the face that were easier to see and 10x sharper than the originals. After these pictures were relased people still weren't satisfied and said that alien markings could've been hidden by the wispy clouds. Mission cotrollers said "It's not easy to target Cydonia"... "In fact,

It's hard work". In spite of all the complications on April 8, 2001, there was a cloudess day in Cydonia and the team was able to get very clear, defined pictures. The pictures showed that the Martian was like a butte or mesa, like the landforms around the American West. "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho," said Garvin.

Despite what the critics tried to argue, there was no way that the "face on Mars" proved life there. With more clear photos of the "face" and reasons to justify that NASA had no benefit for hiding life on Mars, scientists proved that the "Face on Mars" was just a natural landform that had a shadowy likness of a human face.
