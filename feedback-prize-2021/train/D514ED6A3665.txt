Dear, Principal

I strongly believe that more of my peers and your students should help out with our community. By doing that it help our community prosper. Help raise students grades go up. Also, it will help our community help each other through hard ships.

By making the all of the students help with community services. It will help our community be converted into a prosperous community. Where every one has a job and to get them through this sturdy economy. All of the teens will have responsibilities and a job so they will have experience to get a job and keep that job.

It will also help my peers and your students get their grades up. This volunteering or job may count as credits or make your resume look sophisticated . So I acknowledge you to make them be part of the community so they will grow up to be successful.

This out of the ordinary idea will our community come closer through thick or thin. If one family loses a job the community will help or make a fundraiser dedicated to them. Instead of leaving them to suffer. By making this idea work all of the people in the community will feel comfortable around each other and help each other.

Finally, I strongly believe you should put this idea into action. One of the many reasons are it will help our community prosper . Also, it will help elevate the students grades and help our community through hard ships.
