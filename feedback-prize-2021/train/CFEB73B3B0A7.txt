Hi, my name is Lucas and I had an amazing experience by being a sea cowboy. I got to visit many places that back then many people cound not visit. Also I made a lot of good friends. When my trip with the animals was over my friends and I would kind of have a party we would play games like volleyball, fencing, baseball ext. Like I said this opportunity opened the world up to me. I am glad that I now understands other countries needs and the people from those countries. When I was done being a sea cowboy my family and I

had like foriegn exchange students stay with us. I could also teach my family about the foriegn exchange student. Like what his country was like and what animals I brought to that country. Like I said this opportunity had a lot of good effects come out of it. So if you would like to travel the world and learn what different countries needs I suggest being a sea cowboy.
