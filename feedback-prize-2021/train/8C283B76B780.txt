Driverless cars sounds like a good idea to the normal everyday person who has to drive everywhere. But if you actually think about it, its not such a great idea. People would easily get bored and tired of it and then people would start to get fatter and more unhealthy. Also it says that driverless cars arent completely driverless. For example in the passage it mentions that the car will notify the driver when they need to take over if there is an obstical in the way. To me, if these cars cant function like a person dribing, then there is no reason at all to have them. People might as well continue driving by themselves because there is no reason to have a car that cant perform all by itself. On the other hand, driverless cars would be good for people who have disabilities or any other problems that would hinder them from driving. They could go places without needing the help of another person or having to wait for a bus to come pick them up. So my opinion is that they can make driverless cars, but dont make every car in the future driverless. There will always be people who like old fashioned things, and i feel like some people would not approve of driverless cars. So its up to the people of the world to decide whether driverless cars is a good thing and should be put out for the public, or a bad thing and should just be left alone.
