Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because many student will come into the classroom with sad face and nobody will know what is wrong with them but with the Facial Action Coding System, everybody will know what is wrong with a person if he/she is sad in class, And is not everybody that feel happy everyday but with this kind of technology we will be able to know what is wrong with them and we will make sure they feel happy.

In paragraph 5 the author say that in fact, we humans perform this same impressive "caculation" everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. But some people can tell how a person feel but only the person friend and that is not good but with the Facial Action Coding System evrybody will be able to tell how a person feel not only the person friend.

In paragraph 6 it say that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored and that will make the teacher find something that will u feel happy and keep u busy. But without the Facial Action Coding System the teacher will not be able to know what is wrong with a student is either they are confused or bored she won't be able to tell becuase she can't know how the student feel but with the computer the teacher can see if the students are happy or not and they are not happy she will be able to find a way to make them happy.

So the Facial Action Coding System will be valuable in classroom so the teacher can know the feeling of his student.
