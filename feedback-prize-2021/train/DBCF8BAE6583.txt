In the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author supports this idea because in paragraph 4 he says "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and it includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive".

He also says that "Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevours. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation".

This shows that the author supports his idea of studying venus and that it is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
