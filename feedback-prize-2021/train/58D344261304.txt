I believe you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you will get to go so many places. Have you ever wanted to go to the Acropolis in Greece? If you join the the Seagoing Cowboys program then you might do just that. Luke a real Seagoing Cowboy has also visited an excavated castle in Crete. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you'll get to go there and many more places.

Another reason to join the Seagoing Cowboys is you will get to help people. You'll get to have that warm feeling inside basically all the time. You'll also get to take care of animals aboard a ship. You'll get to work with animals like horses, young cows, and mules. Luke got to do just that and had the best time as a Seagoing Cowboy.

My last reason of why I believe you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is because it will open up the world up to you. You'll go many places and when thats done you will do many different activities! You will get to do boxing, table tennis, and fencing. If you dont like active activities then you can read or take up whittling. Luke got to do all of this and had the best time there. This is why I believe you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
