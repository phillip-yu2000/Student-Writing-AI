I'd have to say the new technology ''Facial action coding system'' that has been created in Illionois is acceptable. It beyond helpful in my perspective it could really help out young children whom don't understand what the teacher is saying. '' A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then modify the lesson like an effective human instructor''. This quote states how it the new technology is being used. Especially children who dont understand english. Without saying anything verbally to the computer, and it could help some students outs! It would be extra heplful if it had that ability to translate. The reason why I am saying this because there are some whom don't want to speak and are simply quite and usually just give a face in which the compter can caculate you. And the fact that we humans preform the same expression'' as said in paragraph 5. Inconclusion this would probably help out the students who dont speak for them selves. And increase the ability for young children to be stress free and more understanding in what subject they are currently learning and hopefully be sucessful.
