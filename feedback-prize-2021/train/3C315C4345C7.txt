CELL PHONE USE

We all need our technology right? So I believe the first policy is very fair to us as students. We should be allowed to use our phones during lunch and free times instead of no cells phone at all.

As a student we have work to be done at school we all understand that. It involves concentration and attention, but through out the day i think we should have the ability to have our freedom to use our phones. We might need to talk to parents or someone important and that may be all the time we have and need. If we were to have no phones at all were at greater risk to have even more kids using them. They wont have any other time to use them and they will decide to use them in class. What if a student has an emergency maybe has to check up on someone or is unaware of something that may have happened? They should be allowed to use there phones for that much right? I personally think so and you should too.

Restriction for our personal use of phones is unfair and out of hand for all. Policy 1 to use our phones during lunch and free time is what we need to have and keep. As a student myself you aren't going to have much good coming out if phones were band, I'm sorry to say. Cell Phone are a privilege let us have it.
