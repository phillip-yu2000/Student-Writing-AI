Limiting car usage can be very helpful not only to our environment, but to our culture. Our ozone is slowly getting worse and worse every year. A heavy contributor to the decay of the ozone layer is the greenhouse gasses, like the ones we emit from our cars on a daily basis. A society without cars could create a safer, more time friendly, and environmentally healthy community.

Think of all the tragedies that have spawned from car crashes. Just this year in our local community, a 16 year old boy was knocked off our local bridge and killed by a drunk driver. Our city is still recovering from this, not a day goes by where I don't see a new person leaving flowers in his spot on the bridge. In a society without cars, this would never have to happen again, think of all the potential lives that could be saved.

Think about how much time you spend in a car on the average day. At least 30 minutes to an hour if you go to school, a job, or a sport. If we didnt have to drive everywhere, everything we needed would be compacted into walking distance. Life would be so much easier if you didnt have to stress about getting up early enough to catch the bus, or for your friend's mom to pick you up. you could just casually walk out the door and be at your destination in no time.

Life without cars could be the change that our country needs. Improved environmental conditions, safety improving drastically, and your precious time being saved. Maybe life without cars wouldn't be as great as we're making it out to be, but how are we ever going to know if we don't try. This change would be for the better, and is exactly what America needs.
