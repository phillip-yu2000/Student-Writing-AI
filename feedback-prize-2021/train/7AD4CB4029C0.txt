Dear Principal,

I think that we do need to be able to bring phones at school, because some people have after school activities and need to get a hold of their parents afterwards. also because if the have their cell phone then they can call their parents from school if they were to get sick. You need to think about it more because in my eyes policy 1 is going to be the best.

The reason i think policy 1 is the best is because what if they were to walk home every day how are there parents going to know if they are okay? And if you get hurt on the way home from school then you can get a hold of your parents and get them to come get you. It would make a hold up at a school less dangerous because they can tell you in a text if any one has been hurt or what's going on.

One other reason we should allow phones is because you can get bored with your classmates. So you can talk to other people and not get in so much trouble for cell phones. Also more people will enjoy coming to school and be more quite during class. that is the reason policy 1 is the best for school.

Yours truly,
