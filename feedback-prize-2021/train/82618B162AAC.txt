I don't think its fair to change the policy.

What if the students were close to have an a grade or b ? We all are trying are best and for you gust to come and change the policy. students are even going to have worse grades. Because them thinking that they could only be in a sport if they have an a or b . And them trying there best to bring grades up and have more points! ITS NOT fair.

I say you just leave the things the way it is! Kids are going to do better in school and bring there grades up. But if you just come and take those sports away trust me its not going to be so good at all! Guys are going to argue about soccer and foot ball. Girls are going to argue about there sports and there not going like it.

Leave everything the way you think is best but there not going to like it and the scores are going to down. And your not going to like the way everything is going to be.
