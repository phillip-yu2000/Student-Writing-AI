I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because it would be a opporturnity of a lifetime and it would be pretty cool.

Another reason that you should join it is because you would get to see places and cities. If I were to join it i think it would be cool and fun and an awsome opportunity. If you were to join it how would you feel about it would you think it would be a good opportunity.

First, his point of view was to persuade and convince people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program because he went and he had fun and now he's trying to get people to join is because it is an opportunity of a lifetime. In the story it says,"He was working part-times jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his freind Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat, Luke couldn't say no because he knew that it was an expeirience of a lifetime." He really wants to persuade people to join but not every body wants to join.

Finally if you want to join it might be really fun if I got asked I wouldn want to go because i think it will be really fun but then that's just me. If you read this I hope it persuades you to join if you like it.
