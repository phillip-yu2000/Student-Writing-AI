I am against the idea of designing Driveless cars. For the simple reason, they may be more likeyl to cause accidents and you would be held responsible for the accident although you weren't controlling the steering wheel or the gas pedal. Althought it does seem like a good idea to have driveless cars, what were to happen if one day you got in an accident and the other drives tried to hold you responsible? If we all got to where we are driving driveless cars, there would be nobody held accountable for the accident and how would the accident damage be paid for? The good thing is that if you were on along road trip and needed to take a rest you wouldn't have to pull of to the side of the road you could just keep going and the car would drive for you. I have to say I do agree witht the vehicles that assist you when you drive tough busy areas or work areas, that is fine but if we were to make a car that did all the driving we would get bored and probably fall asleep driving. Which in the long run will cause accidents, as I said before accidents would be hard to decide who caused them. So I would say in the long run drivelss cars are a bad idea.
