Hi my name is Luke. When I was

17 my friend Don asked me to be a

"Seagoing Cowboy". I said yes beacuse it was a "once in a life time opportunity". When I first became a "Seagoing Cowboy" the year was 1945.

When I turned 18 I had enlisted in the army. On the ship we had to work hard day and night, we had to care for the animals during the crossings, We had to lift the heavy bags of oats and hay. We also had to water the animals two or three times a day. It was hard but it was helpful to me. When I was discharged in 1947 I had made 9 trips that is more then anyone else. But I had some good times on the ship as a "Seagoing Cowboy". After we would drop all of the animals off where they were needed we would play game in their stals like, Base Ball, Volleyball,Table-Tennis,Boxing,fencing,and Whittling.

But in the end all of that hard work and time was worth it. I was able to go to so many places!

I went to

Greece to see the Acropolis. I had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. I took a ride in a gondola in Venice, Itally, with streets of water. I also toured in a excavated castle in Crete and marveld at the Panama Canal on my way to China. If you young peaple participate in being a "Seagoing Cowboy" I am sure that you will have the same experince as me, or mabey you will go on to bigger and better places then I ever could of dreamed of. You never know what wil happen when you are a "Seagoing Cowboy".
