Have you ever thought about what it would be like if there were less cars used for transportation? Driving cars emit green house gases that effect the atmosposhere.

if there were less cars driving on the road then it could help alot of people. It could help people that are over wieght or obese because if they walked or jogged to the places they need to go then they could live a healthy life and they could lose wieght. and if people did this then there would be a whole lot of less pollution in the air. I think that if people walked instead of cars they would be happier and healthier.

if people didnt use cars as thier way of tranportation then there would be less pollution in the air that can make people sick, and there would be dangerous gases that cars emit. If americans cut down on driving then every place that cut down would be a better living environment, and every body would be happier because they dont have to worry about drunk drivers or people cutting them off on the intersection, and people all most causing wrecks becuase people would be walkin, jogging, and riding bikes, or anyother way of transport.

overall if everybody started walking or jogging, and riding bikes instead of driving then it would help the air we breathe, it would cut down on car accidents, it would help with people who are overwieght and need excercise, cutting down on driving could help with alot of global problems happening in the world today. So next time you go to start your car, maybe just walk there or ride your bike.
