Inventors are rapidly thinking of new ideas on how to improve the world. One idea might seem like an improvement, but how can we be positive nothing will go wrong. I believe driverless cars should not be manufactured because technology has downfalls.

The idea of having driverless cars frightens me because we are relying on computers to safely drive us. In the article, the author says, "but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents". This is a issue because what if the driver has fallen asleep or the driver is not paying attention and wreckes the car. Again in the article it mentions how the driver would get bored sitting in his or her seat, so to fix that problem car manufacturers put in an entertainment system. An entertainment system is a disaster waiting to happen. Some states have made it illegal to test computer-driven cars. Other states have limited the use of semi-autonomous cars. I believe the reason for this is because technology is never one hundred percent safe.

The way people use transportation today is perfect the way it is. If a malfunction occurs when the car is in drive, the driver might not know what to do and could cause an accident. Cars are safer being driven by a person because the driver is in control and not an almost reliable computer.
