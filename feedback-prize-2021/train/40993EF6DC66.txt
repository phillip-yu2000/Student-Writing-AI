You should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. THe electoral college system should not be kept anymore. The electoral college is a proccess that contains counting of electoral votes by Congress, selection of the electors, and the meeting of the electors where they vote for Vice President and President. Keeping the electoral college college isn't a good idea because when voting the the people vote electors and not for a presidential candidate, and voters sometimes get confused about electors. Many people disagree and agree whether to keep the electoral college but its thier opinion.

When voters vote they vote for a slate of electors not for the president. Many people dont want to vote for a elector. They want to vote for a president because that is the main reson that they are voting. If people vote for electors then thier hopes might get down. Each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Just because the winner of an electoral vote wins doesnt mean the electoral vote wins the national popular vote. In 2000, George W. Bush and Al Gore were running for president. Gore had more popular votes than Bush and Bush had more electoral votes.

According to the article, sometimes voters get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Nobody wants to vote for the wrong electors because that isn't good for people who took thier time to go vote for a presidiential candidate. If many people vote for wrong candidates then they will want to stop voting because it isn't worth it.
