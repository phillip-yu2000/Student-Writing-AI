The policy that i believe is not a better policy is policy one because, if you let students bring in there phones to use during lunches and other free time most of them will not turn them off for class and be tempted to use them during class. They would also be a distraction to other kids if other people around them are using them during class. If they go off during class it won't just distract one or two kids it will distract the whole class including the teacher. Then the class won't get what they need done. Another reason is that you don't know what the students are doing on or with their phone. they also might try to call people during class to get a student in trouble. they could also distract the kids that are using them and they might miss out on something important.

The policy i would choose if i was the principal is policy two because, the students not being able to use there phone might make them not want to use it because, they don't want to get in trouble. This policy might keep kid from texting in class while a teacher is not looking or trying to distract another kid and it would force them to listen and learn. I also believe that if the students are not aloud to use their phone then neither should the teachers cause that isn't fair. If we have to use the school phones so should they. And them not being able to use their phone in class might make them not will wantcarry it and then they will wanna do work instead of texting.
