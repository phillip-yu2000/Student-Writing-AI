In the French and Swiss borders, Vauban streets are completely car free. In Vauban Germany, enforcements are very strict on car policy. Some people even have to sell their car to move there. Although, car ownership is allowed, but it is only to be parked in large garages along with a home for $40,000. Because of this 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars.

In 2006 Vauban grew a trend in Europe of separating Suburban life from auto use to "drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes." They called this "Smart Planning."

While there had been effort to make the city denser during the past few decades, Vauban had gave 5,500 home to residents, making it less accessible to public transportation, and less space for parking. This leaded to the making of the environmental Protection Agency. This agencies promotion was to reduce car use. In the result of the agency, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highway and only 20 percent to other transport.

Germany doesn't seem to be the only one to ban cars. Driving in Paris has been ban due to smog. Paris banned driving due to near-record pollution. To confiscate, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear to air. Along with the driving ban, a fine was included too for some. On Monday motorists with even numbered liscense plates were told to leave their car at home or recieve a fine of $31. Odd plates would suffer the same consequence as well the following day. This all led to approximately 4,000 drivers being fined. After five-days of intensifying smog, conjestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france. No surprise, the diesel fuel was blamed for the incident. Accordingly it mentions diesel makes up about 67 percent of vehicles in France.

Gradually, in one week, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to recsind the ban for odd-numbered plates the next day.
