I, Luke Bomberger, think that it would be wonderful if you participated in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I have three great reasons why you should participate. You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. You would get to sail overseas. You would be able to have free time on your way.

When I say that You would be able to take care of horses, young cows, and mules I mean that there would be 335 for all the types of animals. You would also get to have the chance to sail over the seas and have fun because you would be able to sign up with your buddy and travel together. The last reason is that you would be able to have free time to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime.

After reading these reasons that I stated I hope that you consider joing the Seagoing Cowboys. These are the reasons why I think that you should join. You would get to take care of horses, young cows, and mules. You would also get to sail over the seas with you buddy or even by yourself if you want. The final reason is that you would get free time along the way to see things that people may never get to see in their lifetime.
