Students that don't have a grade B average or higher should not be able to participate in any sports or other activities. It can affect their behavior and school work if they are allowed too. Students with a grade C average or lower shouldn't be able to participate in any activities for these three reasons: If the principal allow them to play with a low grade average then their grades may drop even lower, students with high grade averages deserve to do fun things during school, and students who don't try doesn't deserve to get the opportunity to do fun things.

One reason a student with a low grade average doesn't deserve to participate in activities is because if the principal allow them to play their grades may drop even more.

For example, If a student has a D in all his/her classes, and he is allowed to play, he may think that the principal doesn't care about his grades, and they may drop even lower. Most students care more about sports then their grades. That's why they should base students grades on whether or not they can participate in any activities.

Another reason is Because students with higher grade averages deserve to do fun things. For example, If a student has an A in all his/her classes they should be allowed to participate in activities. They deserve a reward for all of the hard work they do to keep their grades up. If a student is doing good in classes it would be a good thing that they have an opportunity to do things other then school work.
