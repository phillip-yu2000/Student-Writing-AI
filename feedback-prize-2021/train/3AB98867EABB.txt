Have you ever asked one person for advice? Maybe he or she is the only person you ask for that. If that's the case, then you should get into asking more people for advice, because you can improve your social skills, and it can help you understand how other people see things.

Improving social skills can make it easier for people to ask for advice. When asking for advice, people need to self- advocate, express feelings, and more. If none of that is done, then how else will they get what they need? Social skills is also another way of making friends. The more someone has, the easier it will be to get the best advice. There are students in school that don't feel comfortable talking to a teacher or consular, because they dont feel secure with themselves. Social skills can be a great way to get advice from them, because that can teach students how to be secure, and it get what they need if their friends can't help them.

Seeing other viewpoints can be a great way for people to get advice. If a friend says something, and another friend says something else, then it will be good to understand why they are saying what they said. It is recommended to experience both viewpoints and decide which one fits best, if needed. When both perspectives dont fit, there is always someone else with something completely different.

In conclusion, improving social skills and seeing other perspectives is a good way of saying that people should ask more than one person for advice.
