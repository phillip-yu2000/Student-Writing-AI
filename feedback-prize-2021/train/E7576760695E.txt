To agree, or to not agree. I am all for the idea of driverless cars. Just knowing I would be safe in a car can manage itself and not worry about being in a wreck makes me feel better about the idea. There are a lot of people who tend to be reckless drivers in the world and we can not be having that knowing there are people with families and children risking their life to drive around. I know how often recks happen in the world and plenty of people die due to examples like drunk driving. To have a car that can drive itself would be a great idea.

There are already cars that, somewhat, control themselves. For example, the vibrating of the seat to let us know if we will run into something while backing out of a parked area. Or the automatic breaking when it senses a wreck in motion. Over time, creaters are becoming more advanced in coming up with ideas for the cars they are developing. They plan on making driverless cars already but they still have to gradually get to that point.
