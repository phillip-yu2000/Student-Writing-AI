Dear Principal,

You want only students with a grade average of at least a B to be able to play sports. Some students aren't good at, for an example, math so they might be getting say a C they are really good and love the sport.

Are you going to kick them off the team? Or say they can't play? They might not be the smartest in the class but why can't they play? Maybe they could get a touter but are you still going to say no if no improvements are made? Well think of it this way if you loved basketball and you were trying out for the team. You had made it but on your next report card you got an average of C. The coach says you can't play unless you get your grades to a B. So you get a touter. No improvements are made. None! You still have a C. You get kicked off. You feel horrible. So I am just asking if you let it be an average of C. Some students have difficulty learning I know I do.

Please, because if it were you how would you feel?

Most students have a grade average of C. If they can get it up to a B

than great. What about the ones who can't? Are you going to say no to sports and other school activities? Think about it. What if they are doing their best but can't get a B average? I am asking that you let it be C. Please don't change the school policy. It would be a great if you could leave it.

Thanks a lot and remember "What if it was you?".

Sincerely,
