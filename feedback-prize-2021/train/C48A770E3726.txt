Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I do think that helping our community by doing community serves is very important.

We need to keep our community clean. If we don't it will just look like a big trash can.

It is important that kids help, it's not so hard to give up one hour of your day to help the community. If we start with the little things we can make a difference and do something bigger and better.

I think the reason many kids my age don't want to help is because their just stubborn an not willing to make some time for helping things like this one speacialy. Kids think that they have better things to do than help others even I'm like that sometimes.

We don't really understand the importance of this task if we let our towns, our cities, or communities build with trash we'd be destroying our world. I think its that kids old and young want to help our community . It builds character and i would like the opportunity to do community serves.

It's really offal to see trash on the side of the rode or highway because someone was careless on just through it out of the car or on the side of the rode while they were walking and that's why i require that we start community serves.
