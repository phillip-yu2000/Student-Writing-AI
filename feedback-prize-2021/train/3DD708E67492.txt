Dear Principal,

I am a student athlete at this school and I think that it should stay at a C grade average. A C average is a passing grade and that is good enough to participate in a sport or any other extra curricular activity at school. The schools have been doing great in sports and other activities like in art competitions, chess club, math club, and science club. The skill level will probably drop in sports. There would be less players in a team due to grades. Teams might have to forfeit because their team doesn't have enough players or some schools might not even have a football, basketball, or volleyball team because there wouldn't be enough students to complete the team. The schools chances of ever winning a championship in any sport is very slim. Most of the athletes here aren't that bright in every subject. But the school can also help if they could tutor the kids who are failing or are close to failing a class. Many kids or teenagers don't rely on their knowledge to get into a Division 1 college, they use their talent, skills, and special gifts to get them their. But we also have to push our student athletes to exceed in everything they do. In my opinion students should be able to participate in any school activity with a C average in their classes.
