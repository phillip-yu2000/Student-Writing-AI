I think that people should get involved with sports because kids need to be health and happy. Also they would learn how to get along with each other and not take every thing serous. So one last reason why is kids would be more focus in school and would get better grades at the same time

One reason why i think people should get involved with sports is because people would be healthy .that way kids can live longer and don't have to be scared of cancer or heart attack or just going to sleep and not waking up.

Secondly reason why i think people should get involved with sports because if kids get along together there would be less fighting and less violence. so that way kids don't have to go down the street watching their back. Also kids would be trusted and they would know to stay away from drugs and other thing.

last reason is that kids would be more focus in school and wouldn't be thinking what is for dinner also because kids would let there energy out playing and not in the class. so then they will play outside not inside.

So these are my reason why schools should allow kids to play sports and help out in schools.
