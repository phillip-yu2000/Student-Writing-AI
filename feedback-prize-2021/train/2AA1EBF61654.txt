Dear state senator

I'm against the Electoral College, and i wish it would change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational, and there are many reasons why it should be taken out.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president(Source 2), this is unfair to voters because the people are not the ones that really choose the president. Also, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they focus only on the tight races in the swing states(Source 2). Why should we put the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters?

Another problem with the Electoral College is its method of selecting the president, which may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state(Source 3). Knowing their vote will have no effect, the voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular vote(Source 3). If we're not voting for the president, but for the electors who will choose the president, then why are we voting at all? I say that it is our right to be able to choose who our next leader is going to be.

With all the evidence I have listed in this letter, I hope you, state senator, will change your mind about the Electoral College. We must do what's best for our country, and the Electoral College is not fair to us, the people of the United States.
