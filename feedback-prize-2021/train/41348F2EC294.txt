Dear Senator

I am writing this letter to you to tell why i think we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote. See the thing is Senator the Electoral College seems like a biais to me, its unfair to the people. Many Americans dont vote because they fair that that votes won't go to the right person because in truth and in facts when the American people vote they're not voting for who's to become president they vote for the electors and not knowing that the electors dont always vote for the same person the voted for so all Americans are doing is meaningless voting because they dont really have a choice they may think they voting for Obama and the electors voted for Romney. And thats why most Americans dont vote.

I feel it wouuld be best if all voting is done by popular vote , because either way all of the American people dont get a say in the voting rules but at least they know that there not being cheated.

Because when they vote by electoral college most states dont even get the chance to vote because its small or under populated , which is unfair not because you know a state is small and it might not make a difference doesn't means they dont have the right to vote its totally unfair.       Â
