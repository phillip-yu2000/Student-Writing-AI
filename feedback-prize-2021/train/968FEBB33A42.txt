How asking for advice is better.

Did you know asking advice can lead to better health and it will help you as an overall person. Here's how, when you express your thoughts and emotions its naturally better for the human mind and body on top of that, it triggers your brain to think around objects blocking your path, which will make your final product as good as possible example, if you were programming you want it to be the best it can possibly turn out. Or if you were trying to make a car. In other words it will help you not make the same mistakes and it will help you grow as a person and a leader and, it will help you with very important life skills. Throughout the conversation you may have a change in prospective, even better if helps you get a better understanding of the topic when you have different sides arguing. It helps you get a better understanding of your friends, and it gets you to know them better. This all apply s to when your asking multiple people advice.

Some reasons it can be bad to ask advice. They may give you a negative response which can be the start to a nasty conversation. They may give you false information, causing you to fail on a test or a second argument. Its always better to go from fact over opinion. When your constantly mad it raises your blood pressure which can increase the risk of having stroke, diabetes, and to much brain pressure can lead to death, potential of your brain to bleed and other serious injuries. This all apply s to when your asking multiply people advice.

I personally find it better to ask for advice both for your health and mentally, it helps my writings or arguments. Theres more pros then cons, which proves it better to ask for advice than not. For me it shows some of the good graded assignments I've had I would ask for advice from my parents or students.
