Venus is a dangerous planet with 800 degrees fahrenheit, a thick atmosphere made up 97% of carbon dioxide, and highly corrsive clouds of sulfuric acid. You may think thats pretty dangerous. It is, but with the authors insights well find out why scienctist want to go there so badly.

The enviroment is so deadly that it can crush a submarine, that was made for going to the deepest parts of the ocean, and liquefy many metals. So you may be thinking, well writer its too dangerous for us so just forget about it and stop rambling, well thats were youre wrong. The Author claims we could fly 30 miles up in the air and hover around on the blimp. The tempature would only be 170 degrees fahrenheit but thats also survivable for humans, maybe not easy but still survivable.

So that seems safe enough for my beliefs, so maybe it should be safe enough for your beliefs, but hey thats just a theory, an Essay theory.
