Using cars creates admissions that damages our ozone layer. Communities around the world know this and are doing something to relax the damage being done. They are doing temporary bans on cars along side with other cities, and trying to make cars with much lower emissions.

Using cars in major cities makes it so noisy but also makes it very bad for the environment, and ourselfs. When you live in a major city like for example New York City, people choose to walk rather than drive cars. Not only is this healthier for us but it is much more healthy for the rest of the environment.

In suburban Germany there is a town that has banned cars from the street completely and has most people riding bikes and walking. Most of these people dont really car so much about having to walk or ride a bike. In Colombia they had one day where they banned cars and in their city of 7 million people, most people walked or rode bikes. Germany and Paraguay arent the only nationd that are taking a part of this, other nations like France, and other eurpoean countries are joining in. President Obama has also pushed for cars with lower emissions and higher gas mileage. This will help save people money if they dont really have it, and help save the amount of gas used and emissions caused.

With all this in mind it would be useful to lower gas emissions or even to stop using cars in general. It will be healthy for us and the environent. We dont even have to get rid over cars completly either, we can just switch over to electric. Theses are easy solutions to our problem, and also giving us and advantage in the world we live in.
