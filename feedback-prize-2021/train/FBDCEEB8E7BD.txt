Hi, I am PROPER_NAME and I really recomend that you join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program can be hard work at some time,so be ready for that. There are also many benifits to this trip. I myself had a very exciting and memerable journey, and if you decide to join you will have one too.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program you get to see tons of new places. I got to see places like Europe and China. I also met and created a bond with new people, While I was there I saw new cultures. This program allowed me to be aware of other countries and there needs by not hearing about them, but actually witnessing it. I also had some fun on board with the other members of the Seagoing Cowboys club. We played games like fencing, boxing, and even table tennis.

Now if I told you that the Seagoing Cowboys program was all fun and games, I would be lying. There is a lot of work to do. One time I fell down a slippery ladder. I didn't die,(because if I did I couldn't have wrote this.)but I did get hurt badly and I cracked my ribs. There are many responsibilities while on board. I had to work with animals. I had to load and unload them off the ship. Also on my second trip I was the night watchman, and my job was to check on the animals every hour.

Even though there is is work to be done the Seagoing Cowboys program was a great opritunity for me, and it could also be a great opritunity for you.Helping out at my aunt PROPER_NAME's farm prepared me, and maybe you have some preperation too.This trip taught me more than i could have ever learned at home.The Seagoing Cowboys program really opened my eyes.I hope I go again,and I hope I see you there.
