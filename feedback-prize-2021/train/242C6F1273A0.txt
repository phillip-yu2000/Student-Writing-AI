Aliens couldn't have created this! If it is formed by some kind of rock that is placed on mars, how could a alien create this? This "Face on Mars" is a natural landform. Most of the pictures that were taken of this landform were compared to other landforms that are on Earth. The "Face on Mars" was compared to landforms such as, The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho." Both landforms are about the same height.

In the photos, there is no signs of any alien artifact. There isn't any monuments, pyramids, or symbols found around this landform. Other than a shadow that looked like an Egyptian Pharoah, wasn't anything else found to suspect aliens made "The face on Mars." If there was an ancient civilization on Mars, it would help us figure out how this was made.

So... Until you can give a good explanation or opinion that aliens have made this, it is a natural landform.
