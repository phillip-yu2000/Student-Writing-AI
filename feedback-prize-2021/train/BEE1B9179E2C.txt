To the principal:

Community service is good most of every body like's to do it but, there is about 20 to 30% of the people in the school dose not like to do community service. And you try to make every student do community service

I think they should have a saying weather they want to do it or if they don't want to do it. It's not alright for them not to have a saying.

If they are in iss then I

think the need to do community service then but if they do nothing wrong and t they don't want to do it then they should not have to. You can go around school taking a survey about who wants to do community service and who don't want to do community service.

What if there grandma or grandpa was in the hospital dying and they had to do community service and they don't get to day goodbye to them.

Now if you don't make them then if they do have someone in the hospital dying they would get to say goodbye to them. It would be good for the environment and it might do some good for some students but, if they say no then they should not be forced to do it. So take a vote who wants to and who don't want to do it.

sincerely your student.
