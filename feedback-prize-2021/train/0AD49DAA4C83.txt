If schools are giving students projects to do over the summer, then the projects should be student-designed. I would imagine giving students summer projects to be a pain for them, since many students are taking a long break away from school and have probably made plans to do things with their family and friends, but if they were to be given projects that can come up with on their own, students would continue to learn about the lessons that their teachers had given them, the project alone would increase their creativity, and school counties will be able to see how much information they have taken in over the entire school year.

Although students coming up with their own assignments to do for the summer project would increase their learning abilities, have trouble thinking of their own project and how they're going to make it. Not only that but teachers assigning the project to their students would be a bit easier than students having to look up a topic and figure out what to do on their own. I know that sometimes having to figure out what you are going to figure can be a bit challenging, especially if you dont know what the topic of the project is, but having a teacher assign the project to you would be less frustrating because they can tell you what you do and do not have to do or what you need before you leave for summer break.

Students being given assignments by teacher would also be a terrible option due to the fact that said student would not be able to be as creative as he/she wants to and they would not be able to do the topic that they wanted to do. For example, a teacher talks about the summer-project and he/she would assign them to do the project on something history related. It wouldnt exactly be fair to any of the other students in the classroom who dont want to do the topic in what their teacher gave them. Having to do the project alone during their break would already be a pain, but i think if the student had created something related to what they wanted to do, then it could make them more inspired, and motivated instead of giving them something that theyre not even interested in, which is exactly why i think student-designed summer projects would be the better option.
