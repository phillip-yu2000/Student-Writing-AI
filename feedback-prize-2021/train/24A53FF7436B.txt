I dont think that driverless cars should be developed. The reason i think this is because of all of the problems that driverless cars could pose. Drivng is all ready dangerous enough and they want to risk peoples lives with machines driving themselves around without humans controlling them? I could see how some people might think it could possibly be a good idea. But the dangers far outway any reward that could come from driverless cars. Not only would they pose a serious threat to other drivers on the road, but like the article said, if a car malfunctions and causes an accident then who is at fault? The human in the car or the manufacturer that produced the car that malfunctioned. Even if driverless cars could be produced they are nowhere near being ready to be used on the open road.

Plus what would a the driverless car do if it got stuck in traffic or ended up having to pull over for a school bus or an emergency vehicle? And if the car started breaking traffic laws or started driving wrecklessly then how would the person get a ticket if he was not the one that was driving carelessly? The way i see it is that human driven cars have done the job perfectly for one hundred years. And since the way we drive is doing just fine why try to add more dangers and make it more complicated. What would happen to the manufacturer of the car if the car got on the road and malfunctioned and ended up killing somebody. I think that this is another case of people getting carried away with technology and not understanding or not caring about the potentially fatal dangers of putting driverless cars on the road with families.

This is the reason that i feel the way i do about giving machines freedom and trusting them to drive on the road with other people. I feel that the dangers far outway the risks for this idea and it will be much too expensive to try to adjust the roads to let independant machines drive around on them and endanger other innocent drivers on the road.-
