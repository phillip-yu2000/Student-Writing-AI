Dear Principal,

I Believe policy 1 is a better choice. I think you should consider choosing policy 1 because I think students should use their cell phones during free periods or lunch. Policy 2 is a little harsh because some students will probably use their cell phones during school then get caught and have them get taken away. Policy 1 is a much better and fair policy then policy 2. Policy 1 students can only use them when they are in lunch or in any free period. If a student is using their cell phones during any other class except lunch or free periods then they should get a warning and if seen again the teachers should take them away from the students and ask the student parents to come to the school and pick it up. If a student cell phone isn't turned off during class and goes off then the teacher should give the student a warning but if it continues to go off then the teacher should take it away from the student. I also believe if the student has his/her cell phone hanging from his/her pocket the teacher shouldn't just take it away just because they see a cell phone. The teacher should only take it away if the student is using the cell phone during any class except for lunch or free period. Policy 2 is not going to work because maybe the student needs a cell phone and has to bring it into school incase the student parents call the student for emergency's. So I believe students will still bring in cell phones because their parents told them to if the principal choose policy 2. That is my opinion if the principal should consider policy 1 then policy 2. I believe the principal should consider policy 1.
