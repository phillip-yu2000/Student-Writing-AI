Driverless cars should not become a reality. My first reason why driverless cars should not become a reality is that they can malfunction and badly injure or possibly kill the people inside of the car. Driverless cars can run over an animal or human and possibly kill the living being in front of it. A couple tires can pop and swearve off the road into the a road beside it and injure not only the people inside but inncocent people in a car that didn't see what had happened.

For my second reason i think that they could get hacked and get send into the wrong direction. People can get lost and never find their way back to a safe place. Someone can hack the driverless car/s and end up killing the people inside or outside the car by controling the GPS and other important parts of the car.

For my third reason i believe smart cars possibly like driverless cars can or will get a virus and it will mess with the engine and everything that is important about the car. I know from experiance that a car with a t. v. can get a virius if it is not fixed properly. I believe a driverless car can or will get some or many viriuses if it is not check out properly when it is getting fixed.

To conclude my argument driverless cars can be a danger to nature and the people inside or surrounding the car. Driverless cars can get hacked and hurt people more than cars that need a driver all of the time. Driverless cars can get many viriuses and malfunction and destroy what is most important to the car.
