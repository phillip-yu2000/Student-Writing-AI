Author claim that people should study more about Venus by conduct a mission despite the risks. It may expand the very edges of imagination and innovation, and for human curiosity. However, the author makes a fabulous statements by explain the Venus, talk about the missions that scientists are seeking, and pursuade the readers.

At first, in the beggining of the passage, he made a explanation of the Venus by comparing to the Earth. He first explain that Venus and Earth are similar in terms of density, size, and distance. Then he states that there are thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets in Venus, and their temperature and pressure is really high compared to Earth. This information that author gives us is great because readers can get backgroung information that can understand the missions and their risks that author will going to explain in the later passage.

Second, he talks about the mission and their pros and cons. First, He says that NASA is seeking for sending humans to study Venus, but it has difficulities. However, author says that it's avoidable. For example, temperatures in Venus is very high, but their air pressure is close to that of sea level on Earth, so it's survivable for humans. This supports the idea clearly that readers can know it's possible to travel to Venus.

Finally, author pursuades the readers. It's valuable to meet the challenge to send humans to Venus. Peering safely at Venus from ship can't collect anything. We need to conduct a mission to take samples of rock, gas, or anything else. As you can see, author is pursuading the readers that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It seems it's not enough to pursuade the people and he can be more emotionally.

Overall, his statement and how he supports that idea is really clear for the readers and it is settled. It own a risks, but conducting a mission to go to Venus is possible, and valuable for the humans.
