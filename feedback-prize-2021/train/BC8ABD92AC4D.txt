Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that this rule should be in affect.

I believe that grades should come ahead of extra curricular activities.

I think that students should have to have at least a grade average of a B to be able to do what they want to do.

Grades will affect you for many years to come.

Things like sports and such will affect you for your whole life also, but your grades will affect wither or not you play sports.

For example, if a person wants to become a professional athlete, to achieve that goal, they have to have good grades, and be able to play that sport well.

If they can play that sport well and don't have good grades, they wont be able to make it to college to be able to play that sport.

I am in band myself, but with band, I am also able to maintain a B as my grade average.

But some people don't care about their grades, they just care about the sports.

What they don't realize is that to be able to play that sport professionally, they have to make it to college.

In order to make it to college, they have to have good grades.

In order to have good grades, they have to put the grades before the sports.

If they really care about their career as a professional athlete, they will also put a lot of effort into their grades.

If someone has a below B grade average, they obviously don't care about their grades.

They just come to school to play sports and hang out with their friends.

I think this rule should have gone into affect a long time ago.

So as you can see, I believe that this rule should be put into affect very soon. It will not only affect their future and their lives, it will also affect the lives of others around them.

Your student,
