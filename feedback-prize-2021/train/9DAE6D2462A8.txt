It's 5:00 am and you just wake up for school, but how do you get to school? Studies show the the majority of highschoolers drive. But many dont realize what emissions from fossil fuels do to the enviroment. Smog can destroy the ozone layer and induce toxins into are bloodstreams. Some countris have been inducing partial bans on cars. Limited car usage from these bands can help reduce smog, increase air quality, and save money.

The first reason why Limited car usage can be a good thing is because it can reduce smog, in heavily crowded cities passerby cars make up over 50% of fossil fuel emissions. Thats over half! reducing car usage can save the enviroment from pollution. in paris driving was partially banned for about a week and the smog in the city was reduced by almost 60%. just driving every other day instead of everyday could help your local enviroment immensly.

Secondly, Limited car usage can increase air quality. The use of less fossil fuels causes less carbon emissions. Carbon emissions can decrease the amounts of oxygen levels in the air. So to put it simply, less driving equals better air! It's that simple.

Lastly, Driving less frequently allows you to save money. Gas is expensive, the average American spends over 15% of their income on gas every year. That can really add up. I'm sure theres a million other things you would rather do with your money than pay for transportation. Many transits and buses offer free transport as a substitute. That's right, Free!

The reasons above are why limited car usage can be a good thing. So what if you have to ride a bike or use public transportation. Don't reducing smog, increasing air quality, and saving money seem more important than your complaints about sitting next to someone on the transit. Think about it.
