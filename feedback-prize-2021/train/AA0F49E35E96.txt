To the principal,

You should consider changing the call phone policy to Policy 1.

"Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time."

Policy 1 should be picked because the policy allows students to bring cell phones into school as sometimes students need to use their cell phones after school. Students keeping their cell phones off during class time but allowing students to bring the cell phones in school will allow students to contact their parents after school. Policy 2 does not allow students to bring their cell phones into school is too restrictive on students. Allowing cell phone use during lunch and other free time is also a good idea. Students can use the phones to contact other people outside school and can contact heir parents if they need to. They can also be contacted during their free time by family members to give them news that they would not know until after school when they get home.
