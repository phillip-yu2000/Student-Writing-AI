dear principal,

i think policy 1 is a great choice because students already use there phone during school and text during the teacher is teacher or before there work is finished. it would be great if we could also text after our work is finished. I think policy 2 is a bad idea because what if after school a student needed to call his or her parents? They wouldn't have a phone to use and if it was a emergency then that student or the person he or she is trying to help is in big trouble! Those are just the reasons i can think of at the top of my head why policy 1 is better! Some students might say the same thing and i think there right also. And if you don't take my word for it then you should take a school vote! I think that's the right this to do. So ms. principal if u don't think that policy 1 is a good choice then your going to make a lot of people unhappy and i'm sure u don't want that.
