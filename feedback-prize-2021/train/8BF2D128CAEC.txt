Dear Principal,

I believe students should be required to do community service. This would be a great opportunity to clean up the roads and towns. Most children have nothing to do on the weekends. Working in the community would help them get outside for some exercise and help keep them out of trouble.

Each student should be required to do one community service project each semester. That way, if students have something to do one weekend or don't have a ride, they can do the project another day.

Students can work together and get to know each other better. Some kids that are shy in school, could learn to work with other children during these projects.

I think doing these community projects would be a great benefit to the community, as well as the students themselves. Having the students do community service projects will eventually bring everyone together, and make our community better.

Sincerely,
