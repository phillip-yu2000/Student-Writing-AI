Yes you should have a B average to play sports .If u can't get a B average you should not be playing sports at all. If I was the coach i will see how all my player are doing and have they teacher give them a grade on the work every day. Then at practice if u got a bad grade you have to run the whole practice. So he will get a B average or u can't not play in the game or you can't practice. So i think he or she will get a B average to play. And one more thing you should have is good behavior in class. But at SCHOOL_NAME our mission is too get good grades and go for all A's. All sports should be like no grades no sports that what I think because all kids can do it. Your grades are first and sports is last. I play sports an I have to have a 2.5 to play sorts at SCHOOL_NAME.
