Phones and Driving

Many people use their phones while they are driving. About 390,000 injuries happen each month due to someone distracted by their phone. Using a phone while driving is dangerous, and it needs to stop. Two ways that we can stop this are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones.

Even though there are already laws against using your phone while driving, they should be more heavily enforced. Law breakers should have to pay a fine for putting other drivers' lives in danger. If it is still done after they are fined, they should face jail time. For the third offence, they should lose their licenses. That will be an effective way to stop some drivers from losing their attention to the road by using their phones.

More hands-free software should be added to phones. The hands-free software should be mandatory to have on every phone. They should have it where you can answer calls and reply to text messages with your voice to minimize concentration loss from the road. It would be a great idea to make it mandatory to add a hands-free software to each phone before they go on the market shelves.

In conclusion, ways to stop phones and driving are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones. If these actions are carried out proficiently, up to 421,000 incidents related to phones and driving could be prevented each year.
