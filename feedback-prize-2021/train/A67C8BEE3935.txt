Cars have become an important part of our world. From their rising fame came consequences that effected our daily lives and our enviornment. Limiting car use can have advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making ones community better to live in.

By limiting car usage, the amount of greenhouse gasses- gasses produced by exaust, carbon dioxide, etc.- would be reduced. Greenhouse gasses effect the ozone layer of the earths atmosphere and that in turn effects the health of everyone breathing in the earths oxygen. Greenhouse gasses, albiet the healthy sounding name, is not good for people or the enviornment. By limiting car usage, people can put a dent in the amount of greenhouse gasses being produced. "Passenger cars are responsible for for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States" (5) This means people can change the world by simply reducing their car usage.

Changing the way one lives can change the way they look at life. Some people in the community of Vauban have found happiness just by reducing their car usage. "'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.' said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two" (3) In this community people get to experience walking down the street, hearing people instead of the constant sound of a running car. "In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway." The people living in the community don't have to go out of their way to buy something when they can just walk down the street and purchase it. The town of Vauban entertains the choice of effeciency and health over inconvienence and unsafe air.

Limiting car useage can have many advantages, like reducing greenhouse gasses and making one'sÂ  community better. Although cars are convienent the people in the town of Vauban would rather live in a reduced car community.
