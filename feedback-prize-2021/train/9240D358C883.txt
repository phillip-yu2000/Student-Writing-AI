Therer are many reasions why you would want to join the cowboy riding the waves program. One you get to meet all diffrent people from all around the world. Another one is you get to visit all diffrent countries around the world. You also get to try great food and macke good frends qand learn new games and,you get experiance with animals.

Like luke said during the free time you got to play games. Such as baceball,voleball,table ping pong/table tenis,boxing and all difrent games you learn. But like luke said there are risks. Like when he fell and almost went overbored. And he also cracked a rid and,was out of work for a few days. If you get sea sick ezely this is not fore you you go over very rouph waves in the Oichan. And if you get home sick this is defenetly not for you you will be far from home.

These are some reasions why you might or might not want to join. It is fun but you also take a risk. and that is what luke did and he loved it.
