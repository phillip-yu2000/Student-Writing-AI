To the principal:

Many students/kids are only interested in sports when they come to school. Probable why is because, they do not like learning or are unable to learn due to the lack of concentration. Others, may do horrible in school and play sports to make their parents proud. If you enjoy playing sports, he/she should keep their grades up. That should be a responsibility that every student should take upon themselves if they want to play any sport at school.

Many of those who intend on making or being on any team should have a copy of their progress/report cards with them. If they do not have at least a B average they shouldn't be allowed to try-out. Many coaches do not apply this to some of their players because they are excellent at playing that particular sport. The principal should take this into consideration.

If students are on any sport team and is failing or below a B average, there should be tutoring classes available. If they do not intend on going to the tutoring and getting the help so they can stay on the team, he/she should be kicked off the team due to their grades. This should go into consideration.

A large multiple of schools around the world have this as their priority in order to be on a team and get to be on the team for the whole season. This should go into action so that when these students graduate, they will have a good athletic record along with a good grade record. This will also help them get into colleges and be able to get scholarships easier.

Sincerely,

An eager student
