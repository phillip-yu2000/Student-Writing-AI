Principal,

Students should not have to perform community service as the other willing students or teachers. Simply because we do not make the mess so why should we have to clean it up. It does take time away from what we have to do ,or time we have to spend with loved ones, and family. People are made to pick up trash they're garbage men not ten and eleven year olds. Schools are for education not humiliation. No one wants to pick up someone else's trash or dirty works on the road or in public. People have to do that on Probation or while they're in jail. We are kids not slaves, or some governments workers. They hire people to pick up trash and keep the community clean. So that must mean that they pay people for no reason and lose money while they have no money at all. We can choose weather we want to pick up trash or not. All im trying to say is that their is no fun in what that has to do with and kids want to have fun. Adults like our parents can make that decision and make us not the school and with all respect not you.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
