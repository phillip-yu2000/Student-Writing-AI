" I cant believe that the face was made by real life aliens its unbelievable! " Jim said

" Dont tell me you believe that the fae was made by aliens. " i said

" Actually yes i do. I believe aliens are truly real and don't care what anyone says. " Jim said

" Jim there is no such thing as aliens maybe they may be real, but we have no sign or evidence that aliens are truly real. You watch to many Sci-Fi movies jim you need to lay them off for a while. " I said

" Well if you think aliens don't exist then tell me prove to me how the the face was made then. " Jim said

" Ok i will let me just go and get the picture. "

I said

In my head i am thinking jim is nuts there is no way an alien had made the face.

" I'm telling you jim aliens did not create this. " I said

" If aliens didn't creat this explain to me why or how this was probably formed from the picture. " Jim said

I look at jim right in the eye and was glad to show him with confidence that i was right and he was wrong.

" Look jim in 1998 when Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over cyndonia for the first time Michael and his team to ten pictures sharper than then the ones that the viking's photos took. When we all saw the photos it revealed a natural landform and no alien monument. " I said

" I still don"t believe you. " Jim said

" So you want to me to explain more? " I said

" Go right ahead. " Jim said

" Garvin said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snakes River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. " I said

" Well i guess you have a point there, but that doesn't change the fact that i believe in aliens. " Jim said

" Ok you can believe in whatever you want, but i was just simply telling you what we told to other people that also believed it was made by aliens. " i said
