Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know that you are in a bind right now with the major decision of allowing students to bring cell phones to school, or not. There could be advantages to both policies.

I think that policy one is the best decision. Here are some advantages of being able to have our cell phones at school. If students are allowed to bring their cell phones to school then they would beable to use them if there were ever an emergency. Also they could use them to make notes for when something is due. Students could also use them to receive text messages for if they are going to get checked out or if they need to go to the office. Using cell phones for this purposes would save a lot of paper.

If cell phones were allowed at school then kids would have to keep them in their lockers when they are in class, so they wouldn't be a disturbance. Also when the students are allowed to have their cell phones they would have to be kept on silent or vibrate.

I hope you consider my reasoning that we students should be allowed to have our cell phones at school and use them at the appropriate times.

Sincerely,

Your student
