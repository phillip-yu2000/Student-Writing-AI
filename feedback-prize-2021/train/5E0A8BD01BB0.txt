Here are some convincing statements to see if you want to participate in the Seagoing program. Here is one reason If you like the military you will like the Seagoing program you go on so many uniqe places you go to Venice,Italy a city with streets of water. You go across the Alantic Ocean,but if you don't like staying on ships that long you wont like the Seagoing program. The cowboys have some fun time on board they play baseball,and vollyball games in empty where animals had been housed. It sound like fun you go on trips you meet new people and play sports on the ship so it isn't boaring. If you like animals you will also like the Seagonig program you ship a lot of animals to different places you ship 335 horses to different places from across the world. Here are some other sports you play table-tennis touraments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games that also help pass the time. I would love to join and go to different places with people that could be a new friend to make. It is still kind of risky because people still break their ribs and not get to work for a couple of days and not get paid or you could die from sickness or broken ribs and if you get sea sick you won't want to go into the seagoing program. It sometimes chang peoples lives because that is who they are that is their hobby now. If you like all those reasons to join then you will really like the Seagoing program so go down there and sign up I think you like it and why not try it.
