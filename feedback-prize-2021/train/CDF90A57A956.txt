Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people.

Taking eyes off the road while driving is one of the first lessons that is taught to a driver in his early driver's education. Drivers who talk while driving do not pay attention to road and thus end up in an accident. They put not only their life in danger but other drivers and pedestrians. Text messaging while driving is a bigger danger than talking on a phone while driving. While texting, the drivers have to completely divert their attention from road to their cell phone and their hands from the steering wheel to the cell phone.

Hands free devices are used to avoid accidents, but recent studies shows it is in the leading cause of accidents while cell phone car chargers force the driver to take both of his hands off the steering wheel to car charger and cell phone and thus loses control of vehicle and putting life in danger.
