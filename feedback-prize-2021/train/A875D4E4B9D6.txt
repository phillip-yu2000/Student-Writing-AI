The face was not created by aliens for many reasons. An example would be how NASA wanted to take a picture, to reasure the American people. If it was created by aliens NASA wouldn't want to be taking pictures of it. Also it wasn't kept a private matter, NASA wanted all to see the face. Anothere example would be how NASA went out of there way to prove there cliam. Mission controllers stated that "it was not easy to target Cydonia". "In fact it was hard work", NASA stated how they didn't pass over the face very often. The last example would be how NASA took the picture a such high quality for the people. The article states that the team used maximum resolution for the photo. Back when the first Viking photo came out the quality wasn't as advanced as it was in 2001. I think the quality of the photo helped the American peole to understand NASA's cliam. After all was said and done NASA said the photo just shows a butte or mesa which is commonly found in the American West. That's why I think the face wasn't created by aliens.
