Dear Principle,

I greatly disagree with you. Many students struggle with keeping a C average and it is considering a passing grade so why not let them ''pass'' on by and play sports. This also has upset many parents as for their kids are athletes but cant play for this reason. Many schools around let their kids participate in school sports with a c average. This can also affect our athletics and how we perform their for some kids will not be able to participate. This also can affect how many students attend this school for the new rule. So it looks like the odds are stacking up against this despicable new rule. And its my opinion that this new rule is very unlikely to pass with the B.O.E. I think they will veto the rule as if they see all the odds against this new rule. I honestly really dislike this rule and so does many other people. Also some of the other activities can be helpful to us as in community service. So this rule can harm the school in many ways; as in sports, community service hours, participation and etc. that is why i disagree with you on this new rule as well as many other students and people do as well.

sincerely,
