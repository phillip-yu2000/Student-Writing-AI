There are many reasons why you should particiate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is one-hundred percent, a once in a lifetime experience and opportunity. It is much, much more than just an adventure. It is a way to open up the world to yourself and others. I just couldn't say no, and you won't say no either! These are just a few of reasons why more people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It is an opportunity/experience of a lifetime! There are many great adventures and ways to have fun. We got to take an amazing tour of a excavated castle in Crete. We also got to see China and Europe. Also, getting to see the Acropolis in Greece was very special. We also got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. The streets in Venice, Italy are completly water!

We also have a lot of fun on the return trips, after all the animals are dropped off. We have competitions and play many games. We play games such as, baseball and volleyball in the empty animal holds. We also have many competitions such as, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, reading, whittling and much more! We have so much fun once the animals are dropped off!

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was the most amazing experience ever. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. It opened up the world up to me! I'm grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. This was truly a great experience. The awareness I had then, is still with me to this day. I am still aware of people of other countries and their needs.
