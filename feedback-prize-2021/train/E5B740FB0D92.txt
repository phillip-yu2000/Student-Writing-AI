Dear state senator, I want to keep th

Electoral College.

One reason is that the winning condidate's share of the

Electoral College in variably exceeds his share of the popular vote. For example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral ote compared to only 51.3 percent of the populr votes cast for him and Romney. Under the electoral college system, voter vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. False, Electoral College vote for the president. I want to keep the Electoral College. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates. The thoughful voters should be the ones to decides the election. I want to keep the

Electoral College

. The

Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states ( by population) lose by virtue of the mal-aportioment of the senate decreed in the constitution. so, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receive a majority of the votes cast. there is pressure for run-off elections when no candidates win a majority of the votes cast; the pressure is reduce by Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political prefences rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.
