Have you ever thought about joining a Seagoing Cowboys program? Well my name is Luke Bomberger and I am a member. The Seagoing Cowboys program is a group of people that help countries that have been in World Wars recover food, supplies, animals and more. The other members and I do so many cool things in the program! If you were to join you could do these cool things with us. So you should think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Joining the Seagoing Cowboy program is an opportunity of a lifetime. While traveling you can see many landmarks or historical sites. Maybe we could see the Great Wall of China sometime! You could meet many new people in the world. Oversea you could learn many new languages like Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and many more.

If your in a Seagoing Cowboys program you could visit many cool places. You could see the Great Wall of China or even The Acropolis in Greece. While being in the program I've been to the Acropolis in Greece and I've ridden in a Gondola in the streets of Venice, Italy. You could visit landmarks and even statues of historical figures.

After delivering the animals and food we clean everything up then we have a bunch of free time. In our free time we play baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to help pass time. We play all these things in the cleaned out stables of the animals. We all have fun! If you were to join us I bet you would have a bunch of fun too.

In conclusion, joining the Seagoing Cowboys is fun, friendly, and fantastic! We help many people but we have fun at the same time. Everyone in the program right now is having fun. I would love to see all of you join the Seagoing Cowboys. Hope to see you sign up soon!
