Anyone who has watched television for more than five minutes in the last two or three years has undoubtedly either seen a commercial that shows the gruesome consequences of texting while driving or seen a news story that spoke about a person who lost their life because of a text message that simply could not wait.

Texting while driving is not something that should be done under most circumstances, as a person should be giving their full attention and focus to the road in front of them, not the phone in their hand. Texting should not ever be the main priority in a personÂ’s life and there are a number of instances where the person should put their phone down and wait for the proper moment to send that all important text to a friend. Once a person gets used to texting while driving, there is no telling where it will stop. One of the biggest problems with the technological advances that are being made is that it is turning people who used to be thoughtful and caring about the world around them into zombies. When you are constantly staring into a phone, you are bound to miss out on the little things in life.

Texting while driving does not encourage a person to care about their surroundings and fosters a sense of detachment from the world at large. Constantly waiting for that next text to come rolling in is no way to live.

Life is not always entertaining. But with the advent of smart phones, people are now discovering way to keep themselves amused constantly, which is not healthy. There are moments in life that are sad, boring or simply indifferent. When you do not give yourself a chance to appreciate the slower periods in life, you are not able to appreciate the good times as much.
