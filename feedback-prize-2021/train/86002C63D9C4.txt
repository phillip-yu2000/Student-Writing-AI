Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think students should perform in community service to help our environment.

For example they can help in picking up trash, helping schools, or helping other people. If we start to do community service our environment would be a better place for us to live in. Once someone stars to help other people would be interested in helping to.

We can try to get the students interested into going to the parks and pick up thrash that we see so our parks would look cleaner. We can also plant trees so we can make our community better.

We can help in elementary schools with the smaller kids. We can take a day of and go to their classrooms and read to them. We can talk about the importance of helping others.

We can also talk about how they can help our community into being a better place. We can go to the bigger kids and try encourage them into helping and they can try to encourage their family to help as well.

We should let the parent know that is important to keep our community clean by doing community service. If they know about these, they might help and get their kids interested into helping to. Once they know about community service they can spread the news to friends, family, and neighbors. If can get the city into helping us do community service then we would be making a change in our community and making it a better place to live in.
