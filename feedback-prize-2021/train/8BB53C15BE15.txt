dear: principle,

i have strong feelings about playing sports and would love to play them but some times school work gets ahead of me and i can not get a break once in a while. i was thinking of a way to allow students to play sports with a c average because if students are able to play a sport they are given happiness and free time is crucial to the students.

the first reason i will give you is about having hard classes. if a student has a hard class and does not have a B average then that's because they are stuck inside the walls of the school and that's is not fair. student s say that oh man school is so boring, well that's is because they are trapped inside the walls of the school.

my second reason for this dilemma is that didn't you as a child like or had a passion for any sport? many kids do and they are being blocked by demanding grades like having a B in all classes its not right. ok i could see if having all B' s is fine and nifty but geese give us a break. you know we are only kids were not super-man you know!

if i had ran a school i would make sure that kids of all ages could have fun and still be very smart because over cramming your brain is not healthy one bit. i assure you if you do make your policy change you wont be sorry. kids and parents would actually recommend your school. a great man once said i have a dream, well i have a dream that all kids should not be ridiculed of having C' s instead of B' s.

are we as kids not given our independence? don't we have a say in our America? and with i say give me fun or give me books but i will not stand and let grades be the end of my social life!

thank you for reading with love and concern:
