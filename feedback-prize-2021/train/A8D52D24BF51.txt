I agree that this technology is hepful, I believe it can help a lot of different people in many ways. I believe that this could be helpful because some kids/adults go through hard times and turn to death as an option. Many others may not agree with this technology because they don't want help nor do they want their emotions being able to be detected. This type of technology could help others in a various amount of ways. Here are some examples, a kid at home could be upset and the parents will never know because they don't pay attention to their childs emotions.

The parents would be required to do an everyday scan so they are aware of their childs emotions. Some parents could find out how their kids really feel and get them help. This technology could keep the suicide rate from uprising.

Doctors could use this in their offices to help patients. Especially infants, infants can't state how they feel. The doctor could scan the babies face and see their emotion.

" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."

Those six emotions detectors could be very helpful. Who knows they might even come up with more emotions to detect. This could help large amounts of people. So I agree with this technology.
