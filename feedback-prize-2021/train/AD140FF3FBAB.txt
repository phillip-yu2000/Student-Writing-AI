You should join a Seagoing Cowboys program. It is very fun to see some things for free with us. Young man, would you want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program? No! Why? It doesn't seem fun. Well you should join my friend Luke, he loves this job. No! Well I'll tell you it is fun

This is a fun thing that a young boy could see practically something every day. Well it doesn't seem cool. A kid did this every day once his friend asked him, it was a chance of a lifetime and he took it. Chance of a lifetime. Will I get to see the Great Wall of China? Maybe. Great, I'm in!

See folks chances of a lifetime rarely happen so join today. It is cool sites just ask my friend Luke. Luke sum this thing up. Well when I was a city boy and I was invited on a trip of a lifetime and it was fun. I reconmend you join now.
