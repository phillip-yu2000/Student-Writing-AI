Do you want to see a lot of cool places and help out people? If you do then join the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think that you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program because you will see a lot of unique cool places. You get to help different people. You also get to do a lot of fun things while adenturing.

Some of the places that I saw was the Acropolis in Greece, I went on the gondola ride in Venice, Itally, and I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Another reason you should be in the Seagoing Cowboys program is that you get to help other countries in need and you also help the people that lost mostly everything in the World War 2.

You should also join because you get to do farming and if you did that when you were little and have been experienced then you will know what to do. You also learn things while you are in the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you like farm animals then the Seagoing Cowboys program is for you. You have to enjoy ships if you do this program because you will be on a ship for a while.

When you are on the ship you get to do a lot of stuff to pass the time like you can play different types of games with other people on the ship. You can play games such as table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. You can also play baseball and volleyball. You get to see exciting things on the way to different destinatons. You also get to go to different destinations all around the world.

When you are a Seagoing Cowboy it is more than an adventure to some people. You get to learn more about the world. You get to do stuff with different people around the world. You get to have an awesome opportunity. But most importantly you get to help other people suffering from loss around the world.
