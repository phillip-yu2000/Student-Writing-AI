Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is a better choice becuase the people arent actually voting for the president, the are voting for a slate of electors. this unfair because the people aren't picking who they want. People should be able to vote for who they want for president.

Changing to election by popular vote for the president is a better choice and it is fair. I know this because in source 2 it says " Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president". That example shows that the electoral college is unfair because the people arent actaully voting. Also it doesnt matter if the one presient gets more votes from the people, what matters is how many electoral votes they get. The electoral college system is not letting the people of America vote for who they want for president.

Changing the election by popular for the the president of the United States would make everything simple and better. Some people think they are voting for the better president who would make the country better but in reality they aren't. The votes of the people dont matter in the electoral system they are only voting for electors. The electoral college system is unfair and not right.

In conclusion, removing the electoral college is better and voting for president by popular votes is fair and better. The people will get who they elected for to make America better and a happier place for people. Also the people will be satisfied.
