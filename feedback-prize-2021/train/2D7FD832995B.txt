Dear TEACHER_NAME

I'm here to talk to you about community service, and why I believe that kids should take apart in this satisfying activity I hope after reading this, you understand why I think students should not be Required to join this action.

By doing community service not only are you impacting the person next to you, your also impacting the entire community. Doing something that helps can make you feel good on the inside, however I believe that if the student is willing to or not to, should be able to choose for themselves whether not they should take part in it or not. Example; I rather have a Student who is willing to do the work, then a student who is forced to it because they are required to.

You also wouldn't want the student to feel obligated to join Community Service because He/Her will have guilt of doing it. Instead of requiring students to join, have announced events and school projects for Community Service, and maybe even offer breakfast for the people show up.

I hope this has opened your eyes and heart about requiring Us students to do Community Service, also please take in mind; The students who want this opportunity rather then the ones that are forced, will give more effort in their work and time.
