Dear principle,

I believe that your first policy seems to be a good one. As long as students are not using phones during important class times they should be allowed to have their cell phones. I do not see why they should not be allowed to use their phone during a free period such as lunch or an advisory class.

Although, this is a very good policy their should be an agreement that phones must be in a locker during important classes. Also, since this is such a sweet deal for all students, I feel that if students are using a cell phone during a class that they should not have a phone in, that their are strict coincidences such as:

Detention

Suspension ( in school)

&

Suspension (out of school).

I also feel that for every time they are caught with a phone in the wrong classes, that the punishment gets longer and longer each time. Also, if they do not learn their lesson after 3 times they cannot attend ANY fun school activities.

If they are caught with a phone in the wrong class more than 5 times that they should be suspended for the rest of the year, and when they get back next year that student should not have any phone privileges at all.

If you disagree, I understand but i think you should agree with me one hundred percent. Phone use should be okay as long as it's a strict policy. No phones out of a free period or you face the coincidences. Now, doesn't that sound like a fair deal to you? Because i must say, that seems extremely fair to me and it sounds like an amazing deal as well. Now, I know you adults usually don't make deals with us students, but i think this is a fair exception.
