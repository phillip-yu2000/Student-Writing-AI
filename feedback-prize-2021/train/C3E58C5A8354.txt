Peaple should join this program because you will learn about what the passage is about and write what you think its about. So,Luke was a cowboy that rode over seas. He rode the Pacific Ocean 18 times. No one's ever rode the Pacific 18 times. He started ride the seas in August,1945. When he was heading for greece he was 18 years old.

So,I think he rode the Pacific 18 because that was how old he was turning. But it wasn't that he wanted to ride the seas he rode the seas because World War II in Europe so, I think Europe was is homeland. Luke had found many countries in some ruins. The countries were running out of food supplies so,since Luke was generous he gave them the food supplies they needed even animals. How nice was that of Luke. Luke wanted to help them more so he told them to get in the ship.

Luke was incredible he made nine trips. It took Luke to cross the Pacific two weeks. So,If you times the two weeks it took him to cross and eighteen times he crossed is thirty-six weeks to cross the eighteen times. The ate and drank water but they had to be fed twice a day or three times a day. They played basketball and volleyball. Where the animals were housed there was more games to play like table-tennis but only tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,wittling,and other games. Being a seagoing cowboy was harder than having a adventure but thats Luke opinion.

Other peaple will have different opinions like adventures are better than being a seagoing cowboy,hating doing both,or not noing what a seagoin cowboy or a adventures does.
