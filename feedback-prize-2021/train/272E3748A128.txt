The voting system, known as the Elctoral College, is still being disputed today. There has been many occassion where it has been tried to be elimanted. Some voters think that it is an anachronism. They don't realize that it is a well thought-out voting system. It helps gives more opportunity to smaller states and makes elections alot easier.

The Electoral College, is basiclly a winner-take-all system. Where whichever President has majority of elctoral votes, wins, no matter what the popular vote was. It gives opportunity to smaller states. The way that the Elcetoral College works, is that your state is entitled to a number of electors, a Congressional delegation based on state population, as explained in "What Is the Electoral College?" For an example, the District of Columbia, is "...treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College..." It gives the District of Columbia, almost like a voice, saying, "Hey I'm small, but my votes matter."

The Electoral college, helps alot with making the elections easier. The election season is already stressful and pressuring to begin with. Waiting for results of who the next President might be, raises anxiety to the roof. The Electoral College, helps very much to predict what the votes may be. Why? "Certaintiy of Outcome" as titled in, "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President". The share of the Electoral College also depends on the popular vote of the state, even thought they are two different things. Even a very slight plurality can cause a "landslide electoral-vote". Most of the time, the President that has the most electoral votes, has aswell most popular vote.

I know that the Electoral College isn't the most perferred method. But it is a secure way of voting. It makes the election alot easier and gives chances to smaller states. It shouldn't be abolished like Bob Dole said. Lets keep it.
