What do most people think can do things better, people or machines? I, like most people, believe things are done better by hand. Would someone want a lifesaving operation done by a living doctor that knows what is going on and where things are, or a robot that is programmed to do it and could malfunction. I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times.

Cars do not actually see the things that surrond them. If the driver decides not to pay attention and one of the cars sensors were to malfunction then the lives of many people hang in balance. Road constructions and traffic jams could pose a threat as well. When these things happen do the cars just shut down or try and get through themselves. Either way major safety hazards will arise. Just like in paragraph 2, right now "driverless" cars cannot even get out of a driveway alone. Unless some major ajestments were to come soon, driverless cars remain a huge threat to safety.

What if someone were to get hurt in a driverless car accident? The car malfunctions and the driver could not take control and gets hurt. Who willingly takes responsibility, the driver or the company? Like stated in paragraph 9, to figure this out the country would have to make more laws. All that will waste a large amount of time for both the companies that make driverless cars and congress who makes the laws. Driverless cars will give people trouble before they even hit the road.

I believe that driverless cars pose a threat against people and cars should remain in human control at all times. No matter what driverless cars do not have the instinces and emotions as humans. Cars cannot see what lies 500 feet in front of them, only humans can see that. Technology fails too much and letting cars drive for us poses to great of a threat at this time.
