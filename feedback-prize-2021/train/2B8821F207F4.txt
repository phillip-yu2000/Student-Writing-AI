Luke Bomberger works at a grogrocery store and a bank, he wants to get a better job. His good friend Don Reist gave him an opportunity of a lifetime. Don had invited him to got to Europe on a cattle boat, he excepted the invite. Luke just knew that this would change his life.

In the middle of the story people realized that people, animals, and more looked dried out, so 44 nations had joined to form UNRRA and hired "Seagoing Cowboys."Luke and Don had signed up for it, knowing that they were going to help animals. When they had arrived from taking the animals to New Orleans the day the Pacific War had ended. They had 335 horses plus enough oats and hay to feed them. Luke had recently turned 18 before arriving to Greece. He had made 9 trips before being discharged.

I think that thanks to Don, Luke had gotten a great job just for him. I also think that Luke enjoyed the buisness he was in and what he was doing. Don is very encouraging, helpful, nice, and thanks to all of that he had gotten his friend,Luke, a job. Luke had later began helping his auntie on the farm and it prepared him for hard work. This story or passage is something that I would read again and again. It is very interesting and different. You should definetely think about joinin the "Seagoing Cowboys", it has made a great affect on Luke and his friend Don.
