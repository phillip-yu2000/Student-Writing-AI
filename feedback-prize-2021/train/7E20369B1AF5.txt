Driverless cars? Are we ready for them? Are the safe?

Is the technology thats going into these cars really fail proof?

What kind of laws will apply to these cars. what happens it car crashes start increasing?

There is a lot of irresponsible people in this world. drunk drivers, people who text and drive and some people just dont pay attention when they're driving at all. what happens when a person whos is extremly drunk and is passed out when a human needs to take control of the cars? Young people might be at high risk for car crashes, they might be texting or playing a game and a warning pops up and they dont see it and end up crashing. what new laws will be passed if or when these cars get released?

Me personally im against driverless cars. I think it could potentionally be dangerous. I wouldnt fell safe on the road with these driverless cars. Car crash related deaths could go up at a fast rate. who would be held responsible if this were to happen? The company who makes these vehicles or the owner of the vehicle?
