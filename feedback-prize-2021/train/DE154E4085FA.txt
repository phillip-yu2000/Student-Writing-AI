Do you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy? Well,if you do then join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program consists of many reasons to join. Just one reason is so you can help people out if you join the program. For example,I helped out countries with gaining food supplies,animals,and more. We had to take care of the animals such as horses,young cows,and the mules that were all shipped by sea.

Besides helping people from around the world I had the benefit of seeing diffrent countries,such as Europe and China. But to me seeing the Acropolis in Greece was especially special. But,so was taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,the city with streets of water,but other than that I also traveled to an excavated castle in Crete and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. And I was grateful for seeing all of that.

There are also many things that can keep you busy. I know what really kept me busy,caring for all the animals. They all had to fed,at the most two to three times a day. Also bales of hay and huge bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship. And the stalls all had to be cleaned.

If you think that was hard work...don't worry! Life as a Seagoing Cowboy isn't all hard working. I still had fun doing it! I played games with my pals,we played all sorts of them. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where all the animals stayed,we had the time to play table-tennis tourtaments,fencing,boxing,we read,whittling,and the games all helped to pass the time.

But to me most importantly about being a Seagoing Cowboy,was to be able to let it open up the world to me. It made me more aware that people in other countries and their needs are suffering at hard times just like us. I hope that after reading this you learned alot more about being a Seagoing Cowboy than you ever did before, and I hope that after reading this you will want to be one too.
