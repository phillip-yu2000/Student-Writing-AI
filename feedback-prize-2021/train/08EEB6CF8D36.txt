The author is trying to show us why we should try to shrive for having a human on Venus for the first time, but he did not do it correctly. The author does not support his idea on why we should keep researching Venus and take a human to Venus.

The author uses facts that does not fit his opinion on why we should try to put a man on Venus. He actually uses more reason why we should not put a man on Venus. The author uses the other side of the arguements evidence that he is against as evidence which he should not do. " Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades" (paragraph 2). This shows how the author was saying reasons why we should not try to get a man on venus.

The author may have had a few evidence for his side of the arguement, but he used more of the other side which will make people think the other way than what the author really wants you to think. The author could not support his arguement all the way because he tried to use the evidence on the other side of the arguement.
