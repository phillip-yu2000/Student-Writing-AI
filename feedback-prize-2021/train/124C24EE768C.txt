Dear Principal,

I am very sorry you are considering taking away the sports and other activities just because of students having a c average grade. If you feel that you should take the sports or other activities just because some one has a grade lower than a c average you should take a look at what they are struggling at. First I think it is unfair to take the privilege because some students have a learning disability. It is the schools responsibility to help that student if they need it. Second I also feel that as a school they should help the student achieve a higher grade. The teachers should give more help if the student wants it.

Why would you consider taking the privilege away from students receiving a c. Maybe a student does not have a good life at home and they struggle to complete work because they have no help at home. What if the students are trying their best but don't understand the topic? Or maybe the class is too loud, or the teacher plays favorites? Think about all the possible things that could result in a c average grade because the teacher or subject where a difficult aspect?

The problem with taking away an extra curricular activity is that the student might not have a good life at home. I do feel that this still should require a grade d average or above to play in sport or other activities.

Please consider this a helpful matter. Students need the extra activities to get away from home, enjoy themselves, and maybe help find some things they didn't know they could do.

Thanks,
