Dear Principal,

I believe that students should be allowed to bring their phones to school but can only use them at lunch and passing period. I believe this because if students are allowed to use their phones, they will appreciate school more and want to be here more and if they use them in class they will be confiscated.

One reason I think students should be able to use their phones is if they need to contact a parent/guardian, they can be able to communicate with them or need to get information from another student, they can have access to them

One example of what you should do to confiscate it would be to take it and a parent/guardian must pick up the phone. If caught twice will be kept till the end of the year. I the student is a caught the next year with their phone, it will be taken and given to them after graduation. Another example would be to take the phone each day they are caught with it and have them send a letter to the principal, their parents, and their teachers.

I believe that through this much information that you would consider letting students bring their phone on campus and let them use it during passing period and lunch.

Sincerely,
