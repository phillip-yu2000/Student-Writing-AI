Dear Principal,

I believe that Policy 1 should be the policy that is used in schools.

Phones can be a distraction but if used write they can be useful and helpful pieces of technology.

Cell phones can be good tools if used correctly you can call someone to get you out of a bad situation.

They can even save your life if you get in a really bad situation.

There could be major issues if you don't let students have cell phones.

Someone could get lost and have no way to contact a parent.

What if they absolutely needed to contact a parent and there wasn't a phone around.

Cell phones make it easier to contact friends, family, and others anywhere they are.

There would be little to nothing good about not letting students not have cell phones at school.

Most people now have a cell phone.

Most teens have cell phones.

They are useful, and helpful and can be used for various things.

They are helpful and do more good than bad.

There is no reason to not be allowed to carry one if they follow the rules.

Most kids use them responsively and for the ones who don't well then there can be punishment.

There is no need to make them not allowed

There really isn't a reason not to have them.

If they can't use them during class then there's no problem.

If there not allowed then kids are still going the bring them.

So there is no good reason why cell phones shouldn't be at school.
