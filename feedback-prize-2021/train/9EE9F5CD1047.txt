Luke Bomberger had no idea his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. Until his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say know. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

Then the UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys''to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke then says''besides helping people,I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

Later on it opened up the world to him ."I'm grateful for the opportunity,"he says."It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."And that awareness stayed with him,leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many yaers.

Luke has a lot of experiences and know how places in China and Europe but Luke's favorite of all was seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special and if you were to join you might see those places to and probobly make and meet new and old friends.
