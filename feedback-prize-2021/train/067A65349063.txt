I think policy one is the best choice because like teachers need there coffee, kids need there phone and i think they would fallow this rule and besides kids text during school and lets say you want your parents to bring you lunch i don't want to have to sneak off to the bathroom . Policy 2 is way to strict if you tell kids that you know they wont listen and disobey you. And i almost think all kids including me are hardheaded and giving them or us that kind of responsibility i think we would respect that rule and follow it use it and not try to push are limits i think kids would just cherish this rule and i know i would i mean that would put i mean make a great impact on kids during school not trying to push Policy 1: but i think we should also be allowed to have are phone out like if we completed all of are work in like a study hall i think we should be able to use them like i have an IPhone 4 and i love my music i mean i wouldn't even be texting during a lunch period i would just be listening to my music. And we have this 10 minute brake after 2 period i think we should be allowed to have it on during that break.

,Thank You (:
