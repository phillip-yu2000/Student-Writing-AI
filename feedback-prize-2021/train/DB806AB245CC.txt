I think children should do community service because it could help them stay out of trouble& make sure they do what they suppose to. The children should do everything to help the community it could make thing much easier for them. I think if the children do community service that they won't have to worry about thing that happen on the street and stuff happening to them. Most people would like to do community service because they know it could help them a lot so that nothing wouldn't happen to them, And to keep them with good grades, good behavior it could really help them a lot kids could have a better life with working with community service. Also community service that could really change people around to make sure they doing the right thing and paying Attention to their responsibilities making sure their getting a good education. And to make plans for them to go to high school, Good colleges, to have them with a better future. Some of the community service children could help with little children to make sure they doing what they suppose to do and staying focus on their work Education, Future, And career that's why i think it's good for children to help out with community service and other things to help people out with any thing they need help on. And what they could do to make their life's turn around
