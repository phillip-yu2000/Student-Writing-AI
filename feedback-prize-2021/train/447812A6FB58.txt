Tap ! Tap ! Tap ! is the sound of me texting in the group chat. My friend wanted to know what we think about him instead of just asking me. Maybe the more opinions the more he knows about himself.

Opinions are sometimes things we hear in life. Sometimes good sometimes bad but people still hear them. More people telling their options about you the more you know about yourself.

I know this guy from YouTube who dose a lot of videos but he gets a lot of hate. The things he post is hated by his viewers. He never knew why they had a problem with the videos but he did not. A fan texted him saying that his videos are horrible but it was only one fan so he did not pay it no mind. One day he went live for a Q and A video but all everyone was telling him there opinions instead of questions. So he finally realized that the first person to text him was not the only one with opinions. So here on out he started to make contents his fans liked.

Opinions are better asked to a group then one person. One person could tell you have their opinions about you but you might just brush it off thinking only he thinks about me this way. If you had more than one person to tell you that same thing then you will think I didn't know they all felt this way about me. So a group is better then one when telling opinions.

In conclusion it's okay to ask one person for there opinions about you but your better of asking more people their opinions about you to. Always ask how people feel about your ways to better yourself. A group is better then one.
