In the aticle callled "Making Mona Lisa Smile'. It talks about Dr. Huang made a new system that the computer coul indentift your mood like happy, sad, mad , fear and etc. This new system could work in classrooms by telling the teacher whats the stundents mood, like if they are bored the computer could tell the teacher to lighten the lesson up a bit so the students don't get bored.

This system is a really good system for schools, why? well because it could identify the students emotional expressions and could help the teacher if the studnets either bored or sad. The teacher could help the studnet if he/she is sad. If the stundents are bored than the computer could tell the teacher to make the lessin more fun. This new system could help the students to do their homework and assignments. This could increase the studnets to graduate when they are suppose to gradute or graduate early.

This system could help the school for better eduaction and help the students to learn even when they get bored. This could help the students to graduate when they are suppose to graduate. This could help the parents how they can tell if their child is happy or sad when they come home from school.
