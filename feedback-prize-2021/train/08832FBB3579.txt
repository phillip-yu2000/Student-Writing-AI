Dear $tate $enator,

I believe that the electoral college should be shut down and choosing the president should be popular vote; first, the people don't even vote for the president, and, second, the peoples votes are not even recognized by the president.

For starters, the people don't even vote for the president they vote for a slate of electors that vote for the president. It states in source 2, " Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." This quote shows that people don't even vote for the president. That is just sad.

Also, the peoples votes aren't getting recognized. A quote from Source 2 shows this by saying, " If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry." This quote explains that the peolpe vote for this guy, and the president is elected because of 34 electors, not you, them.

However, people say that the electoral college gives the certainty of an out come. It states in Source 3, " A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote." This quote shows that a dispute is more likely to occur over popular vote. On the contary, it is unfair for the electoral college to cast votes for the people.

Finally, I believe in popular vote because you vote for the president and your vote is recognized.
