Dear Principal,

I believe that community service should be required. I feel community service helps build good character. Also Community service teaches others the importance of a community. It teaches the that by coming together they can accomplish anything.

Community service doesn't only benefit the community it benefits your self too.

I think that community service helps build character. It teaches us children how do be responsible.

Also community service shows that you care about others.

I think that the school should have a day of service. This would be a day set aside for community service. I think this would teach the kids that service can be fun. I think the kids will enjoy it because they are with their friends. If the kids have fun they will want to do it again.

Community service is good for young kids. It teaches them many things. The school is a big part of the community so i think they should take a big part in community service. I think it is a good idea to require community service.

Sincerely,
