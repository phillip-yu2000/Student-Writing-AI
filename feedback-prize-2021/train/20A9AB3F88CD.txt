He did a good job supporting his idea, i see that he keeps comparing it to earth. He said that Venus is the closest planet to earth. He also said the air pressure of Venus would be cose to that of sea level on earth.

However venus is the hottest planet but is second from the sun. I personally ould not go to Venus even if i had a chance. He also mentioned that Venus doesnt have easy conditions but are survivable for humans.

The author also explained that the atmosphere would liquefy many metals. If so it would be very dangerous to go to Venus unless the structure is strong enough to pass thru the atmosphere. There is a 97 percent carbon dioxide atmosphere that blankets Venus.
