Hello dear president, my name is Nathan and I think it's already time to admit that the Electoral college system should always be part of our government.

The electoral college process was established by the founding fathers in order to settle an important compromise in our nation. This electoral process consists of regulating the way in which our nation will decide who will be the next president. Consisting of 538 electors, a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This system allows the most experienced people to choose the future of the nation, and changing it to anything else would slowly cause the whole federal system to collapse. The electoral college method may not seem democratic in a modern sense, because it's actually very unique. This method turn off potential voters for a reason; The candidate that must be chosen is the most prepared one. There is so many factors related to the immense amout of security the college electoral process brings to our people that changing this precise system would be like deciding to turn off the country. Choosing an unprepared president will potentially cause the economy to break, civil wars involving every state, protests, and our nation's reputation to die. It was also revealed this year that in the states in which education is one of the main investments, nearly 90% of the people were in favor of the keeping the system the way it is. The electoral college method is professionalism at it's highest level, and any other different system is clearly inferior to it.

It's politically notable how the nation is reacting to this possible change with disappointment and sadness. I hope you as the leader of the people we all love, will understand the amount of value put in this constitution, and notice that changing it would be catastrophic.
