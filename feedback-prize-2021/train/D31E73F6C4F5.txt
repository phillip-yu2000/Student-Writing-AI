In America,people get into crashes everyday, some fatal or some with minimal damage. Some crashes are caused by people's own stupidity, reckless driving, or distractions like using their phone or staring at something outside. People should use driverless cars because there will be less accidents, more safety, and people can go wherever they want without the distractons of a GPS or map.

In the new driverless car it is said that a 3-D laser will be constantly updating the car's surroundings and that it can mimic the skill of a human being. Most accidents are from drunk driving so if a person is intoxicated and must take the car home they can use the car without having to actually drive and more people will be safe. It is also said that sensors can detect and respond to the dangers of skidding or rolling over because of the computer hardware and aoftware so if anyone is close to an accident, they won't have to worry because of the sensors. Lastley, when people use a GPS or a map it can either break down and have a glitch or just get in the way of driving. With the new car all people do is put the address in once and off they go to their destination without having to worry about what will happen if it breaks down.

In conclusion, people should have driverless cars because there will be less accident, more safety, and not having to worry about a GPS or a map. Future technology is coming and there will be a better future so more lives will be spared from the manual use of a human behind a wheel. Parents will feel more safe about their children in the street and not having to think about what's going on with the driver. Embrace the future technology and don't be afraid of a new dawn and era.
