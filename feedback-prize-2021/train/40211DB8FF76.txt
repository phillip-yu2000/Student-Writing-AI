Are you interested in taking care of animals? Do you like going on boats out in the sea? If both of your answers are yes then you should be a seagoing cowboy. A seagoing cowboy is a person who goes onto a boat and takes care of the animals on the boat.

I think that you should particapate in the Seagoing Cowboys Program because you could explore all of the oceans. Also you could see Europe and many other countries. You could help all of the people that need food supplies, animals, and more. To support this in the text it says "Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,"

Also I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program beause it was an oppurtinity to have fun on board. I know this because in the text it says "Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

To conclude, I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get the oppurtunity to explore all kinds of countries. Also I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Prgram because you got to have fun on board playing all kinds of different games to past the time.
