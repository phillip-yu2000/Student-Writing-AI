Dear Principal,

I write this letter to you because children are not suppose to perform community service. so sometimes children have time to do community service, and some don't have time to do it. For me I rather kids not doing community service because maybe they have better thing's to do. first of all, that kids have to do homework and important projects. secondly, children have the choice to do community service. finally, children have to do chores at home or help mom do something important.

first of all, kids have to do homework and important projects and that's because they have final project for the quarter, but you have to do community service what do you rather do i rather do my project for the quarter. Also homework is a important thing in your school grade and you also have to another community service again, and it is important too and that's why children are not suppose to take community service it take away to much time from important things like family, class work, and projects.
