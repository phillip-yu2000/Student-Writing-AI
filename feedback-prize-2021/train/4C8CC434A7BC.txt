The Seagoing Cowboys is a program that people recommend you join and this is why. Luke Bomberger is trying to convince others to join the Seagoing Program because you get to help peolpe in need,experience new things,and visit tourist sites in different areas.

First,you should join this because you get to help peolpe in need. Luke helped people after World War II was over in Europe recover their food supplies, animals,and much more. Another way that he helped is he took care of people's horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas by himself.

Secondly, you can experience new things. Luke first took care of the animals on a ship and after that he was a night watchman. On the boat he got to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed with the cowboys. He also got to do table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading, whittling, and other games.

Lastly,you an visit tourist sites. Luke got to visit an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. He also got to take a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Lastly,on his way he got to see the Acropolis in Greece.

Now you can see why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys. From helping people in need, experiencing new things, to visiting tourist sites. Now you know what program you can join after hgih school, in the future.
