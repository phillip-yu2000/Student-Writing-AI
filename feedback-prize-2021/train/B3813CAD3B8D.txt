Dear principal,

I believe that children that are in school should be aloud to have there phones just not in the class room itself .I think that because it's not really fair telling someone that they cant have something with them even if it is off in there pocket or purse because it is not bothering anyone if its off .I mean really the only age groups you have to worry about having phones is middle school and high school student because most elementary school kids do not have cell phones .

I also think that if you have your cell phone in class and it goes off and interrupts the class it should be took for a week or two and then your parents can come and get it back from you .That is because it will teach them not to bring it in class or it will get took for a couple of weeks and most kids that have phones use them all the time and they know how hard it is to go with out them . So there for they know that if they bring it to class and it goes off they wont be able to talk to there friends except for in school and if they have a house phone to call people on . So maybe if you enforce this policy most intelligent kids will not bring there phones to class except for if they are put up and also off. So maybe if you do that you wont have to get rid of phones totally at the school you just have to make sure phones are off when kids step in the class and also make sure they are put away .

So now you have heard my opinion on what to do about cell phones in school what do you think of my idea ?I think your idea about getting cell phones out of the school totally is a little bit to hard on the kids .I understand why you don't want cell phones in the school nut still in there free time they should be able to do what they want well in reason anyway .So please take into consideration my idea about letting the kid have cell phones at school just off when you step into the classroom .Let me know as soon as you can what you think of this idea .

Sincerely'
