I disagree with the principal. Not all students can take the time to do extracurricular activities. Not everyone's time is the same after school. The decision would not even be effective. It wont be effective because students may have a hard time in school already, effects sleep, and lack of interest.

Students may have a hard time in school already. Some students struggle with their classes. They don't know exactly how to keep their grades up. Things going on at home already that effects students at school already. Theres challenges that students face that effects school. Students cant handle but so much at a time.

Extracurricular activities effects sleep. Students need their sleep at night. It wont happen if they have a lot of work to do but they couldn't do it right after school. Do to the activity they have to do. Students wouldn't focus well in class which cause them to fall asleep in class.

Students may have lack of interest in the activities. The principal wants students to be interested in the activities. But, if the activities are boring no one would take interest in them. The students would goof off in the activity and cause things to mess up.

Schools shouldn't want kids to have a hard time, mess up sleep, and not have interest in the activities. If students want to do an after school or during school activity then let them. But, if students don't want to it's their choice. Doing something extra is a choice. Students should't be made to do something they don't want to do.
