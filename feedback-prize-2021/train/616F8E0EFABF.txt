"Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore"? As said in the being of "Driverless Cars Are Coming" the question is simple. I can say without a doubt that I can invision diverless cares in the future. Although I can hope for sooner rather than later that is one aspect I can not yet answer.

As I have already stated in the previous paragraph that I can invision this future, but I also support this future. The era of perfectly calculating autonomous cars would be an era of complete safety on roads. The driverless cars not being subjected to human errors would not make the foolish mistakes that a human might make in situations like slick roads, alcoholic influence, and peer preasure. The only flaw with autonomous car that I can visualize is the possible glitches in it's programing that could be prevented with annual mantainance. As said in the article "The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todayÂ’s taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus" Although I do not see a public transport system being the only use of these cars I can agree with the amount of options and the decrease of polution put into our daily life styles.

In the end I fully agree with the use of driverless cars no matter what the primary use is for. With only minimum tolerance for errors in todays technology I do not see the likelyhood of an accident due to the fualt of the car. Although, as the article states, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault". I refute this statement just as the article did it's self by saying "Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved".
