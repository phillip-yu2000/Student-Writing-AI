Driverless cars to me are not such a bad idea; however it is also not the brightest idea as well. Me personally I wouldn't want to drive a driverless car because I would not feel safe. Technology is something big in our generation, and even though I love it, I would not want to be in a car I couldn't control myself.

The first reason I am against driverless cars is because of mine, and others safety. People these days are very lazy. Technology does almost everything for us nowadays. If driverless cars become very popular I feel there will be more accidents. People will be texting and driving , and not paying attention to the road. Another big issue for me is falling asleep! Not having to put in so much work when driving the car will make it rather difficult to stay awake. "Traffic laws are written with the assumption that only safe cars has a human driver in control at all times." Driving a car where you have to do all the work is already hard to stay awake while doing , so why make the job easier by having your car do it for you ?

Some people may be for the driveless cars but in most states they're illegal. Some states are premitted to using semi-autonomous cars, such as : California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driverless cars are not relaible and if they were good cars and one-hundred precent safe they'd be legalized everywhere. Anything can go wrong with driving a driverless car. What if something goes wrong with the car its self; or when its system shuts down and doesnt notify you for all the things that it would if it were on.

Driverless cars are not the best idea ,it may seem cool but if it doesn't forsure keep everyone safe and is not even legalized in all 50 states , it is a bad idea. This is why I am , and will always be against driverless cars.
