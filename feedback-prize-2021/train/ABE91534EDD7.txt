In my opinion, driverless cars are a bad idea.

Yes, I get that it would save fuel and be much more convenient for everyday life, but i think it would cause more problems.

I think it is unnecassary to try to make these driverless cars becuase it could cost a lot, and end up not working out in the long run

First off, in my eyes these driverless cars would just cause more problems for everyday life.

These driverless cars would have trouble getting through complicated areas such as detours, road blocks, parking lots, etc.

And even though there are positive effects for this type of car, I think there are many more negative effects that could put lives at risk, and waste a lot of time getting places.

Do we have the technology to make these driverless cars happen?

Absolutely, but the risk/reward is not worth it in my opinion.

Whats wrong with just hopping in your car and driving it yourself?

"Backseat" drivers that try to tell the actual drivers what to do are already bad in todays world, just imagine a backseat driver trying to yell at a robot driving their car.

Overall, I think trying to make these driverless cars a reality is not worth the time or money.

It would be much easier and safer to have humans controlling their cars and evaluating the situation through their own eyes to mkae the judgement on what or what not to do.

I do not see anything wrong with todays ways of transportation so why fix something thats not broken?
