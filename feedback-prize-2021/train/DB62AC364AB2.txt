Phone should not be used while driving on the road because you're putting yourself, others drivers at serious risk and you can get in trouble. That's why the law says know texting while driving because it wouldn't be safe. Well really you get a ticket but I think they people should go to jail because that's something can't pay around with like people get in bad car accidents because of people wanted to be hard headed and not following rules.

Rules are helpfully especially when it's serious that that people should follow. That all about being safe and doing the right thing. If you don't want to follow them. Then you will have to face the consequence and learn from them. People may make mistakes but when you're on the phone or texting and you get in a car accident, someone dies from it. That something you can't really take back. Then you would really want to go back and change things for the better. But you can't. Just imagine you lose someone because of that person was on their phone and not pay attention, you would want to know why just wait wouldn't till their done driving. You would of have been very much be upset.

I think that drivers should text and call before getting in the car. Its better and it would make more since if they do that. They can also leave their phone at home. At long they don't drive while texting and call other people knowing that they can get a ticket. It's not good to put other people at risk while driving you can hurt yourself, that person, or people that's in the car with you.

Being safe is important and following the rules is also important too. That's why people should take thing like this serious and tell their children to put on a seat belt and also don't text and drive eat the same time. You never know what might happened to you and you may face some consequence.
