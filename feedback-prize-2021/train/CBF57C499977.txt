Dear Principal

I believe that student should be allowed to play any given sport with at least a C average or higher. Some students may try their hardest to get even a C but it may be difficult for him\her. Also, some students may be able to succeed at least a B average. I believe it is a little unfair to the students that try their hardest but can only reach a see, therefore, I am against the situation. I believe that not only does it build good physical characteristics, but it also motivates students to academically succeed. Also, it may encourage students to share a positive attitude at school and at home with peers.

Not only sports even just regular school activities as well. Such as chess, robotics, yearbook staff, or even honor band. I believe that it will help those students with a C average to bring their grade up even further.

There are so many opportunities in school for students to do. I think students should be able to attend activities with even a D sometimes. Some students know what it takes to bring it up and school activities can help. It can be a hobby if students don't have one at home. Also it may give them something to look forward to on a bad day. You shouldn't change school policies... that's my opinion.

Thank you,
