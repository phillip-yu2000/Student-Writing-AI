Every day, people die in car accidents because of the usage of their cell phone. According to research cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents today. But, despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to always stay in touch with other people.

Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to a car crash. For example your boss calls and it's not a good conversation and you eventually get upset. This 1 conversation can lower your driving ability that 8could then lead you to lose control over the vehicle and cause you to crash.
