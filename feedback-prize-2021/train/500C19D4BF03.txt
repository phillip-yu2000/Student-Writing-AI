I think there  would be many advantages when i come to limiting car usage. People would get more exercise when they walk espacially if they are overweight. People wouldn't have to much money on gas that often. when we drive we let out chemicals into the air that causes people to get sick.

Citizens should take advantage of limiting car usage. according to robert duffer, ''after days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. this means, that by breathing in those fumes people can get vary ill or cause them to have a lung problem. also, it would cause a hazard if something were on fire. For example,''vauban, home to 5,000 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life''. clearly, they have less space for parking. obviously people may start using public transportation. Citizens should take advantage of limiting car usage.

additionally,Citizens should take advantage of  limiting  car usage. for instance, ''In previous bills, 80 percent of approprations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport''. this means, that people started taking the highway instead of the freeway. this also means, that they also took  public transportation. futhermore, ''on mondays motorists with even- numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at hom or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)''.overall, if people brought their viechals the would have to suffer the consequences. clearly, they would have to pay out of their pockets if they bring their cars or motorcycle. Moreover,Citizens should take advantage of limiting car usage.

In summation,people should decrease on driving. People may get sick from the the cars fumes. many people may have  to pay a fine if they bring their cars to a certain place if they dont leave them home .many people will probably start taking the city bus as transportation.
