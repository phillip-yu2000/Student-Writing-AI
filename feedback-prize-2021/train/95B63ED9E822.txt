In my opinion i think that we students should have the right to have our phones out during our lunch period and turn them off when its time to go to class. Since lunch period is the only free period of the day then i feel that we should be able to take our phones out. In my school we have assigned tables which means we cant sit with whoever we want. So, I feel that we should be able to text our friends that are in other tables so we don't have to get in trouble if we want to talk with them.

There is more to do then just text at lunch time with your phone. You can play games, listen to music, watch videos, record videos and more. If we could have our phones out at lunch, it would also reduce the amount of noise there is. Sometimes people would yell across the lunch room in order to talk with someone on the other side. If we could have our phones out, there wouldn't be as much of that as there is now. I don't see the reasons why we cant have our phones out in the cafeteria. Its not like we're going to be able to text somebody in another class because they would have their phones off. Most student would be texting while in class instead of paying attention. This is a reason why some students sometimes just don't learn. If we were able to text at lunch and have our phones off while in your other classes, kids would pay more attention and learn more. Being able to have our phones out at lunch would make things easier for the teachers in the lunch rooms and students. The teachers wouldn't have a hard time looking for any students who have moved from their assigned table, and the kids would be more silent and occupied.

I think that if the principal changes the schools phone policy to this, it would make things easier and better.
