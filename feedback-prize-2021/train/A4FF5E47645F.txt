Do you get sea sick and if not you can be a Seagoing Cowboy. It's nineteen forty-five, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries had left the ruins! Luke Bomberger would like you to help out too. If you would take a guess of what you would have to do? You would get to help out people that have lost their economy, food, and shelter.

The thing that this eighteen year-old boy enjoys coming back to get more supplies because the Cowboys play volleyball in the pens where the animals are located. They also play table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

When luke is helping people they also get to go to special places such as the Acropolis in Greece was special,"So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city of streets of water." He also toured and excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

What if I don't want to help said one of the people Luke had ask and what if I don't like taking care of people or animals. Luke had just said but it's a lifetime chance to go to all of those places and it would really make you happy but, if you don't want to go then just don't go. then that person named Joe said he wanted to go and that was Lukes best friend and Luke knew that they were going to have fun.

In conclusion they had been on that ship for over four and a half months just to get to South Africa. Luke and Joe had played table tennis tournaments and many other games. The two boys even played volleyball. Finally they had arrived at South Africa.
