I think "taking online class is not a good idea and it, doesn't have any benefit for students". Some of students asking for online class they think "we can do it, but it is not too easy". I used to have online class, and

"in my opinion online class is very hard"

. And doesn't have benefit. when there is no teacher in class to help students, and some of students are too lazy. they need some body to pust them in class.

june 7,2017. I took my online class. And i was new in USA. That was really hard for me, because i was new here and, i didn't know. How i need to do my works? So that wasn't fun. And i didn't get any thing from that class. Because the class was boring for me and very day works became alot so, unfortunately i drop my class. It is very different; when we are in normal class or we are in online class. Because in normal class, there is a teacher, students and a lots of things to they can make class very easy for students. And have a lots of benenfits, but in online class there is noting of these stuff are in online class. And some times online class make students to skip

, because when they face to face with a problom. They can not ask from online class, teacher direct that make students to skip the class, and make the class boring for students, that is what happend with me. And some times student can not have good attend in class, and that can make student to drop the class.

As wall as online class and conferencing class are the hardest classes. But nothing is impossible in this life we can do it " with hard work and with a good attend in our class". If i need to take online class in future. I will always try to have communication with my teacher. Because teacher is the only person to can help the student on that class.
