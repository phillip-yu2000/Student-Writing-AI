I personally think that it is a big step forward towards a better future, if used properly. I agree that many politicains lie these days, but with technology like this can make a better nation out of us. This example is, i feel the best example of the story. Using this technology properly is the safest way to do it, but. I believe that using in a classroom full of students can be a disaster, i am a student myself. It's why i perfer not to be emotionally monitered throught these computer, most likley because alot of things happen putside of school that teachers arn't aware of. So using that type of technology on students, the'yre emothion would constanly be changing due to being around drama in and out of school. Another reason this would not help the students is because they need to learn how dectect these emotions themselves, and so do the teachers. Using this type of technology can help our courts determine wether a criminal is guilty or innocent. We could use this in way to get people out of danger, such Zologist. they feed and tame animal to be less aggressive, if this computer can detect emotion, then it can help avoid attacks from wild animals. This technology is impressive and can be used in different forms to make things better around us, they can make life easier and get us farther in future. being able to make computers that can detect emotion, can make a robot detect when its being theatened, can see when criminals are up to somthing. technology like this can help us get farther then the planets we know now. I my opinion on this is, i can agree it is an amazing invetion, and can be used an a lot of good, and bad ways its just the way people see on using it. we can both beleive that it should be used to get are nation farther then it already is, but lets not let are own technology controls us.
