What is Venus? Venus is a planet that is the second planet from our sun. The author wants us to explore Venus to make it our second home even though there are some risks that can harm us humans and any other life form on that planet. It will also become expensive to study Venus.

With expolring Venus and humans possibly exploring there it won't be such a good idea because it can cause those peopl to die. In the text it states "On the planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the amospheric pressure is 90 timess greater than what we experience on our own planet."Paragraph 3 second sentence. The author should not include this information because than less people will become less intereted to visit Venus and acttually live there. These are dangerous temperatures for us to luve there becaue we also won't be able to grow food and we could possibly be cooked to death.

It would cost us money to build mechanical computers again. In the text it states

"Another projecct is looking back to old technology called mechanical computers...,but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers andd do not require electronics at all."Paragraph 7 sentences 3 and 5. By stating this in the text he wants us to know a possible solution to explore Venus. A mechanical computer hasn't been used in almost a decade. How can they possibly find how to make these computers again. They probably will make them over and over again that wil recuire more money and by the time they actually get it rioght to explorre

Venus someone could posssible already found a solution for it to happen.

With this being said the author really doesn't give us a view on why we should explore Venus. By giving us possible outcomes such as building the mechanical computer and sending people to Venus. Those don't really help because they don't give us a better explanation to what will happen if we ddo become succesful with them.
