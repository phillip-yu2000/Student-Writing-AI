Dear Principal,

I do not approve of you requiring students to perform community service. Community service was something designed to punish people who do mischief. Requiring students to perform community service may make some students feel liken trouble makers. The school should not take away time that students could use to study, do homework, or exercise.

If you do require students to do community service then some students may do more mischief because they will be doing community service anyway. If these students do more mischief that will be more work for the other students to do. If community service is required the law department will have no way of punishing students for what they have done.

If you require students to take part in community service then some parents may be offended that their child is required to do something that was originally a punishment. While doing community service students may meet kids who got it as a punishment and befriend them while that student is from the "bad group". Since community service takes up a large amount of time students grades may start to slip because they have less time to study and do homework.

My reasons for this decision are students grades will plumate, students may start hanging out with the wrong group, and the law department will have almost no way of punishing students for mischief.
