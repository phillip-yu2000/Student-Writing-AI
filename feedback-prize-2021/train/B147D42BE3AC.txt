The Face on Mars has been a popular icon of space, and evidence in arguements for the reality of ancient alien civilazations on mars. The Face on Mars is a natural landform similar to many on earth, like mesa's common in areas like the nevada desert or the grand canyon. Nasa has taken photos of the land form whe never they have been able to get a good shot of it, which is not very often.

Skeptics were far from convinced by the 1998 photos, many of them claimed that NASA had chosen to take the picture during a cloudy period of Mars' year to cover up an ancient alien artifact, or possible markings. Skeptics did not realise that NASA would benifit monumentaly from the discovery of an ancient alien monument on the surface of mars. In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor again was close enough to catch a pitcure of the Face on Mars, the picture spanned a total of 1.56 meters compared to the Viking's 43 meters per pixel photo, The Surveyors photo revealed simply a landform similar to that of a mesa of butte.

The Face on Mars has been a populars icon for many things in the past, and has been used time and time again for debates on ancient alien civilazations on Mars. The iconic Face on Mars was a subject that was only important to the taxpayers not some scientific marvel or long lost ancient technology. In reality the Face on Mars is simply a land form like any other on the red planet, not an ancient alien artifact or monument.
