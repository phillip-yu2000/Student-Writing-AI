In the article "The Challange Of Venus" the author suggest that studying Venus is worthy to pursuit because our earth and beyond shouldn be limited by danger and doubts but should grow to meet our imagination and innovation.

Venus is the closest planrt to Earth and accasionally the closest in distant too. Scientist have sent many spacecraft to land but each previous mission was unmanned because they could only get to cloud-draped and be there for a few hours. Whitch explains why a single spaceship hasnt touched down on Venus in more then three decades. The reason why its so hard to explore Venus is because almost 97% of carbon dioxide is covering Venus, and the most challanging part is the cloud of highly corrasive aurfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. Aparrently Venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet. It has been a difficult mission to go there.

Long ago, Venus was covered largely with ocean and could have supported various form of life, just like Earth. Till this day Venus still has the same feature that are similar to those on Earth. Venus has rocky mountains, valleys, and craters. They even say Venus can someday be our nearest option for planetary visits. The National Aeronautics and space Administration has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Imagine being able to live on another planet.

This challange to go to Venus has a value, not only because of the insights on the planet its self, but because Venus can also become a home to use. Danger and Doubts should not limite our ways to explore but should expand, to be able to meet our imagination and creation.
