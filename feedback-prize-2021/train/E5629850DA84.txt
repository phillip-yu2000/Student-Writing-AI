Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that you should change to a B Average. Not only does it give kids incentive to work harder and pay more attention in class, but it helps them become harder workers. If they don't think school matters but only sports then you should try to put school before play.

When kids get something if they work hard, they tend to work a lot harder than they usually do to get that reward. I find your way of trying to get kids to work harder in school so they can do what they love best by upping the required GPA is a very smart way. It makes them pay much more attention in class.(Which will help them in the long run)

Hard working is the only thing that has kept this nation intact for all these years, not laziness. So you as a principal should strive to make your students hard workers. And i think the only way to make them hard workers is to make the requirements for them higher and higher. Sure the students may not like it but it's what needs to be done. So i just wanted to tell you good job for trying to make us work harder.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
