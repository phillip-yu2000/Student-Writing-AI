Hi my name is Luke Bomberger . I am a Seagoing Cowboy . I helped countries recover from World War II . Countries were left in ruins and destroyed from the war. The food supplies, animals, and more were scarce . If you have read another article about the same topic then you know 44 nations joined together to form the United Nations Relief and Rehabilations Administration (UNRRA).

When you travel as a Seagoing Cowboy you are doing great deeds and helping countries , but you see wonderful sightings of the countries. I've toured an excavated castle in Crete. It is such a benefit having the job. Also your not just helping animals and with food your helping people . For me being a small-town boy it was a unbelievable opportunity of a lifetime.

If you want to join you have to be fairly prepared because when it rains it is slippery. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is much more than an adventure it opened the world up to me. It made me more aware of other people and other countries needs. On board is rteally enjoyable we play baseball, volleyball, boxing , and others. If this sounds like something you are intrested in please sign-up . I am postive and most certainly promise you'll have a eye-opening experiance.
