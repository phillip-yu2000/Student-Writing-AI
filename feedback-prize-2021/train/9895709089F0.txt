Dear Principal,

I do not think it is okay to have to average either an A or B average to to be in athletics and other activities. Lots of people need to show their passion for sports. If it isn't soccer season in the community, where can they play soccer and participate in after school activities. Especially outdoor sports and activities in the community (soccer, lacrosse, tennis) only play in the spring, summer, or fall. And what about winter? Do you believe in teenagers staying happy and healthy during the winter. So, if , for example, there is a girl in basketball who is getting a C in math but is not failing, don't you believe that she should be allowed to participate in basketball? Even from a 70 average, it could take weeks to bring it up!

And just imagine if someone was failing! And what if there was an after school club.

Maybe a Social Studies group? Yes, there would be exceptions because of that certain club being a study club. But what about, for example, a Drama Club. What if certain boys and girls really liked to act or sing. Should they be allowed to show their passion for it. But, they would not be able to because they are averaging a C instead of an A or a B! And if a student was/is playing the flute in band (the only flute player in that band) would not be allowed to go to a contest because she is averaging a C in science. I strongly believe that you should keep it where it is. Students should be able to express themselves in what they like to do! There can still be exceptions it there completely failing, though!
