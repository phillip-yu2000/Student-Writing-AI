NASA has recently been discussing what is believed to be a face on mars. Some people think that this is some kind of alien marking. The essay says, "scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."(paragraph 2) This may convince certain people to believe that there was once life on Mars.

While it may be true, the essay does not say anything about anyone actually getting on Mars to see if it was really just a rock. Maybe there were bones from a human body attatched to the head. Also in the essay it states, "although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."(paragraph 6)

As a result, the essay also said ' "we felt this was important to taxpayers," explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program."(paragraph 6) So this statement could be implying that they could be making stuff up just for money. If they put that in the newspaper everyone would want to buy it, which would result in making a lot of money.

In addition, the essay says, "only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."(paragraph 2) this evidence from the article supports my claim and says shadows made it look like something. It could also have been the way something was reflecting off of it.

In conclusion, I believe that this thing was just a natural landform. Many of us have seen weird shaped rocks sometimes we just dont pay attention. Also just like the sun forms shadows, that could have been what happened on Mars to make people believe they were seeing a human face.
