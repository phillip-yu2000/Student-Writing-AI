Join the Seagoing program! The Seagoing Cowboys will be a great opportunity to have fun on the seas. You could go to different country's. I went to China and Europe. UURRA hired Seagoing cowboys to take care of young cattle,horses,and mules.

I went on gondola in Italy and I took nine trips. That was the highest than any other Seagoing Cowboy. If you join the Seagoing Cowboys you could beat my highscore. It might take long to go place to place but it is worth having fun on the boat so it doesn't get boring like that and this ain't where it ends. the fun doesn't stop here.

If you don't have fun going to different countrys. Then, have fun on board.

Make up tournaments while you are going to a different place play different games like baseball, volleyball, and much more to do on board. Then, relax and read a book and sleep or take a nap and feed the animals and keep them clean so they don't be stinky and filfty. Keep yourself occupied and do something so you don't get bored and quit.

There are so many reasons to become a Cowboy. For starters, if you don't know how to do what a Cowboy does watch from other Cowboys or ask for help. Secondly, if you want to relax and to have a peaceful time just read a book in a quiet place and read so no one has to bother you. Lastly, the animals need your help to survive and live and so they could go to the other countrys they need to go to so that they could be fed and taken care of. If you sad for these animals that are sick and need you. Join the Seagoing Cowboys today!
