Can you imagine living in a time zone where no one buys cars because they are no longer needed ? The world depend on nothing but technolgy. How would you spend your time? Although there are positive apsects to having a car that drives itself there are also negative aspects to this car. The cars can drive themselves but are unable to drive through traffic jams or raod work . Therefore I am against cars that drive themselves.

Even though the cars are smart enough to drive themselves they are not smart enough to drive on non-smart roads. In the late 1950s GM ,General Motors created a car that could run on a speacial track but the track was enbedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to the car. Therefore all roads would have to require upgrades and this is something that is too expensive. The passage says that the cars can't drive through traffic jams,road contruction and when the vehicle is around danger . So if the driver is not paying attention to the car , the road and others around it then how can the car ,the car would be unable to save itself from crashing. With this being said I believe driverless cars are dangerous and would be way to expensive.

As i said there are benefits to this driverless car , while the car drives it self it provides enteratinment such as sound but when it is time for the driver to take over it turns everything off. This is a great idea because it creates less distraction for the driver.

Imagine driving a driverless car and it shuts down in the middle of traffic ,there is a person driving behind does not notice you are having car troubles and hits you. Whose fault is this accident ? Whose going to pay for the damage?

I feel that there are more downfalls with this idea than great ideas .It is dangerous , too expensive , and takes as much energy and time as driving yourself around. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen .
