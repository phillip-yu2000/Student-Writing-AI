"Mom im going to go outside to get some fresh air" FREEZE! Wait one minute , the air that you breath isnt all that fresh nor clean.

Its polluted.

But check this out people want car usage to end completely , i know you might think limiting car usage is the worst idea you ever heard . Just to stop pollution ? Yes .But if you think about it no cars equal no bad air.

China is one of the MOST polluted cities in the world , cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap air comission.

But oh man, oh man France blame diesel fuel to be the problem . 67 precent of diesel fuel is used in france cars. So maybe that statement is correct.

Another reason why less car usages could be a good thing , it prevent being stuck in traffic & reduce alot of car accidents. Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaaza stated that "Its a good opportunuity to take away stress & lower air pollution" which i highly agree with. Cars are very stressful, they're always breaking down or something ends up going wrong & you spend tons and tons of money just fixing the problem.

"When i had a car i was always tense . Im much happier this way" said Heidrun Walter a media trainer & a mother of two . She walks verdant streets & love listening to her surrounding.

But oh my god in Paris if you get caught driving you will suffer a 22 to 31 dollar fine, Leave the car at home please. Since this no car usage thing started colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work & school. There goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The sidewalks have been replaced in Bogota by broad so it could be smooth and easier to ride on.

President Obama goals are to get greenhouse gas. It would lower emission and improve safty! So i think it would sorta be a good idea if we would go through with no car usage . It would be a much healthier and cleaner environment.
