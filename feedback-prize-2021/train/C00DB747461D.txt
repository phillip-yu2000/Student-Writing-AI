Facial Action Coding System (FACS) should be used in the classroom. The FACS technology would be very helpful in classrooms because it can help the kids in the class understand things better.

The FACS technology would help kids understand better by reading their emotions and telling what they understand and what they don't. The technology is capable of reading human facial expressions and giving the verdict on what they are feeling. Say for example a kid in a class has no clue what is going on in the subject, the FACS system can read his/her emotions and change the course to be a little more understandable for them. It can also help by seeing if the anyone is feeling sad or depressed and they can help that person.

Although this technology sounds great and seems like it has no flaws or problems, it does. The system may become a distraction to the children by them knowing about it and continuing to think about it. The FACS system may also mess up and read the wrong emotions on someone and send the wrong information to whoever runs the system. It is not said how long of a process that it takes just to figure out one persons emotions. Having the system would be better than nothing though. It's better to know how the kids are feeling rather than not knowing at all.

Overall the FACS system is very impressive at figuring out human's emotions based on their facial expressions. The FACS technology would be very helpful in classrooms because it can help the kids in the class understand things better.
