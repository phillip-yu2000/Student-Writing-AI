Dear Mr. Principal,

I have noticed that there is a diversion between students in our school who take part in community service, and those who do not. These students who take part in community service are putting their best efforts to helping their local environment, schools, and families. Those who don't take part in community service are not hurting only themselves, but also hurting those around them who need help. They would rather do what they want, and not what needs to be done. They will never feel the satisfaction of knowing they helped someone in need, nor will they ever feel appreciated by those who needed help. I strongly believe that all students in our school should be required to take part in community service.

Students should not have a choice to participate or not. If it were required, some students may not enjoy it at first, but I assure you that once their time is done they will appreciate the satisfaction they receive for taking part in helping to do something that would not be possible without them. Why wouldn't you choose to do this? The major outcome of adding this requirement to your curriculum would only be positive. This would help students realize what they can do if they really try, and this would help many people and places that need it.

If you choose not to do this it will effect many people. This will effect the students who so far have chosen not to take part in community service. This is because since they have not chosen to help yet, if they are not required, I'm sure they wont change their mind any time soon. This could also effect many areas who need help because less people will be going to clean up local places, or help local people who need it. If you choose to do this, as I already said you will be helping many people. That is why I strongly believe that all students in our school should be required to take part in community service.

Sincerely,

A Concerned Student
