Do you think everyone should be put in an extracurricular activity? I think we should allow this because maybe some students are lonely, maybe some of them need to make friends.

Some people need to work together with other people because their a social butterfly. Some sports like football and basketball help you interact with people because you need that whole team to help you score.

Me on the other hand I like to be independent when it comes to certain things like track if you run track you most likely run alone. Like with having anyone to count on, if you run a relay you mostly need your teammates to help you get the baton passed around to win the race. We do need to stay somewhat in shape though like go for a run once a while. Some of us arent sporty types of people maybe you want to help someone or volunteer for somethings like year book club or the Special Olympics. You could make a club for your school like the homework club or a gaming club or even a after school tutoring class to help people out with there grades.

You could go out and volunteer none of this has to be school related you could just help the community out go plant some trees help the earth. I think we should have a running club or maybe a conditioning club for people who want to train for some like tryouts for a sport or just wanna stay in shape. But if some people dont want to do some things after school maybe we can have some things made to be in the early morning I used to have choir rehersal evryday in the morining and it was sometimes really tiring. But also fun you get to hangout with my

So yes I do agree that we need everyone to do some sort of after school activity.
