Limiting car usage have advantages. For example, being tense can happen having a car but if you do not have a car then your much happier that way just like Heidrun Walter stated in the story. They use smart planning. In suburbans life not having a car is more compact, more accessible to public transportation. Meaning people would not spend more money for gas or anything they will have more money staying in their wallets instead of leaving. They would not car about car insurance or anything because they do not have a car. Also, suburbans are in a new approach of this because now there are stores a walk away.

Also, limiting car usage means less pollution. No more car emissions would be trapped from those cold nights and warm days. There would not be smog also. Cars are stressful and rather than a car use a two-seated bike. Lots of new things can be made in a city rather than cars which are so much distractions.
