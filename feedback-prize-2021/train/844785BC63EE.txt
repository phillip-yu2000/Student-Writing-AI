The author gives many reasons why we should study venus despite the dangers it present. He give also a lot of information for why the planet does not have a good environment. He also list so of th dangers that are there for people and how it could effect them if they traveled to this planet. Like how 97% of the planets atomsphere in carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid.

One reason that the author gives NASA has a possible solution to the hostile conditions. The author says " Imagine a blimp-like vehical hovering 30 or some miles above the roiling Venusian landscape". Like the Jet airplanes today it would travel at high altitude to fly over the dangerous air conditions. But every 30 mile above the temperatureis still a toasty 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

Another reason that the author gives is NASA is working on other way to study Venus. The author says "Some simlified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions". Would the machine give workers the time they needed to study the thing the need.

The last reason that the author gives looking back on old technology called mechanical computers. The authors says " these devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2". The thought was computers existing in those days may sound shocking, But these devices make calculations by using gears abd levels. Modern computers are powerful quick and flexible but are delicate.

The idea of traveling to Venus is a very real thing that could be achevied. Though had work and smart thinking what the author has share give us ideas of what the planet is like and the surface and in the air. The the space ship and vehical and devices that will take us there and help us learn.
