Why is it so important to Do these type's of activites in school? Thesis is that many students don't have things to do at home or they don't do any type of activites at all. I agree with this decision because it would help students make new friends and get along with each other.

I think that Sports is a good decision for the student to participate in because they get to work out,Have fun with thier friends,and meet new people that like the same things as them. Plus when they win in the games they get to spe nd a fun time with their teamates,and can learn how to work as a team and leadership skills.

Wow! Working on the year book that is so cool. I think that working on the year book would be cool because you can be as creative as you want,Take pictures ,and spend time with friends doing fun things. Having the year book is really cool because when you are older you can look back and see you friends and yourself so you can compare yourself from back then to know.

For this conclusion This idea was really good for students to get distracted from electronics and other unuseful things. I hope that students get intrested in this activites and have fun.
