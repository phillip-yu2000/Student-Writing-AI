The author discusses the good and the bad of these cars. The author talks about how they could easily replace buses and/or other methods of transportation. Though the author also states that some of these methods can be costly and impratical. I think that driverless cars should not be developed further. For the reason that it would be much safer with drivers and we do not need to change much then.

With a driver behind the wheel, the driver would be much more effective at keeping themself safe. The driver can see the oncoming cars, traffic, or construction and avoid them. The driverless car could possibly not be aware of some of these conditions and then wreck the car. The sensors on the driverless car could also malfunction while driving and result in the same effect. The driver could just work around all of it and not have to rely on their car to keep them safe. The author even states that right now these situations require human skill rather than the car doing it all.

If we were to have these driverless cars, we might have to change the roads to allow these to work. Changing all the roads to work with these cars would be very costly and take quite a while to finish. We also have to worry about putting new laws into place about safety. Like the author says, if someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer. Would the driver be at fault because they were in the car, or would the manufacturer be at fault because the car's technology failed?

To conclude, the driverless cars should not be further developed. They could potentially put a person in danger, they would not be very cost effective, and a lot would need to be changed. We do not need to change if we already have a system that works well for the most part. The driverless cars would be pointless.
