Dear Principal,

I do not think it is a good idea that you could only play sports or join an activity if you only have a b average or better because most people have a c average. i think u should at least heave a 2.0 to play sports or do any other activity. If most kids have a c average how is there going to be anyone on the soccer team or any other sport. a c isn't that bad. You should change the rule to if u have a 2.0 or better u could join a sport or an activity. If most people have a c average then there isn't going to be a soccer team, basketball team, or a volley ball team. It is hard to turn all your c' s to b' s. Please principal change the rule so we can be the school with the best activity planners and best sports players. Think about it. And remember we love our principal and we will do anything for her.
