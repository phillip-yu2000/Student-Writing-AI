Dear Principal ,

I believe that we should to be able to have our phones in school. I think that we should be able to use them during free time, and lunch. The reason i think this is because there a way to talk to your friends that are not at school or that are at school but your not sitting with them.

Also, I believe that we should use them during free time . Let's say there is a game or event you want to stay and watch , or participate in. You would have to call or text your parents and tell them that you are staying , and to tell them what time to pick you up. I think that we should use our phones in our free time , because if we are not doing anything it is not like were interrupting the class, or ignoring the teacher.

Another reason is, we are not doing anything else at lunch so what's the big deal with using them during a non academic time. We also have games and other fun things on our phones that we like doing . It's a different way to have fun , and yet get into trouble. Also, if we are at lunch we can show our friends something cool or interesting that we have on our phones. If you needed to call your parents to hand in a permission slip , you could just call them at lunch or in your free time.

I hope you understand where I am coming from , a lot of students feel the same way that i do about this phone policy. They also think that this rule should apply to this foundation , and that there should be phones aloud in school , but only in use in free time or lunch.

Thank You for taking your time to read this letter.

Sincerely,

Your student STUDENT_NAME.
