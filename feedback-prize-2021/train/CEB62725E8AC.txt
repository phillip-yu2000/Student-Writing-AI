Letter for the principle

In this letter I'm going to explain which of the policies i believe is better. The policy that I think is better for the cell phones is the first because we could use the phone to ask question like in my case I forget thing and i could ask one of my friend to help me with the homework and if there a problem i could call the police and during class is good idea to turn them off because at some point phones are going to distract students from learning the subject or to study for a test and if you don't have a computer you could use your phone like for an example my phone I have the iphone 4g I don't have computer but i could go on the internet and search what my question is a video to show me how to do my projects. Maybe you left your lunch home grab your phone call your parents if they can they could bring your lunch.

the first policy i believe is better because many students like phone and want to call to have a little freedom to call someone a friend and i now that they could get distracted in calling everyone but that could be good way of communication to help out, to be in touch with your study group. maybe they had an accident in the school and no one has your parents number and your the only one.

so that's why i think that number one is the one that I believe is better. I believe too that this letter helped you out with your decision
