Electoral college votes are used to elect the new president, It consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 must be won by a canidate to be elected. The ammount of electors is the number of memberis in its congressional delegation; One for each member in the house of repersenatives, Plus 2 for the senators. There is also a pouplar vote which is used to see what canidate is the more pouplar one, But this is not used to select the winner. I think the pouplar vote should be used because if the pouplar vote for one canidate but electoral vote is higher for the other the one with the pouplar vote is clearly the one people want more.

I think that the way someone is elected as president should be changed from who has the most electoral votes to who has the highest pouplar vote. For example say you were and 16 other people were sitting at 8 different tables, 2 people are at all the tables, Your voting on which is better mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes, you all have different numbers, and say yours is the highest, which ever you voted for would would basically win unless no one voted for it, Which isnt fair in a real election. In a election the candiates focus more more on the stated with more votes such a california or florida, And if they get the bigger states vote they've pretty much won.

All in all the electoral college isnt fair, the pouplar vote is how we should elect our president, so lets change this and see what happens, Maybe it wont work out that well, we'll just have to try and see.
