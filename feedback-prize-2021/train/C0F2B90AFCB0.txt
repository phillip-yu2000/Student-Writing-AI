The day-to-day need of your own cars may not be as needed as you think. Cars aren't as nice as they seem to be. First of all they cause smog and pollution. But people say that not driving themselves is a stress reliever. Although can be handy people just don't see a drivers license a priority.

Paris is one of the most polluted capital in Europe. They decide to cut the smog and ban some cars of being on the road. "On Monday even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day." You can imagine people weren't happy about it because around 4,000 people were fined; and 27 people denied the fines and their cars were impounded. "The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday."

Although some people were not friends without their cars others thought it was a stress reliever. In Bogota they have a car-free day where no one is allowed to drive their cars; they are only allowed to bike, walk, skate, bus, or take taxi. Anyway to get around with out useing your car. "It's a good opportunity to atke away stress and lower pollution,".
