In this essay, I will write an argument aginst the development of high tech cars. I believe using these cars can be good. These cars are advancing regions in the technology world with the use of more enhanced technology. One thing people must think about is how this idea is not perfect, it will run into error. Lets suppose and accident occurs, who do you blame, the person or the car? Well the car is highly developed isn't it? Well, the person could've stepped on the break?

These may be some questions pondering your mind right about now. In my opinion, I believe we should not have driverless cars.

There's a difference between having a more developed car and having a car where you do not need to drive. A more enhanced car will higher technology, sseat warmers in the back and cameras that help you view the blindspot. Man, we have come a super long way with technology. Driverless cars? That almost seems too advanced for our present time.

We must realize that being advanced in areas is not a bad thing. If anything, it's good. We must remember the safety aspect of it all. Is it safe? We must remember the cost. Is it affordable? Some of these questions will really make you think.

The idea of having more developed cars is certainly not a bad thing, just maybe now is not the right time. We can think of better ways to farm and cultivate our food. Helping other countries that are in need with more useful techniques. We should use this time to find out a more efficient way to do more for the people around us. Maybe having a more developed car is doing that, but I don't see it.

Thank you for letting me share my opinion.
