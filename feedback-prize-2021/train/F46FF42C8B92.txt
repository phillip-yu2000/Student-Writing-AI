Have you ever thought of how the Facial Action Coding System could be beneficial in your everyday life? In a painting of Mona Lisa this sofware is very helpful at describing emotions. This technology can help computers and humans to communicate better. "At least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The softwarre is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institiute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate." This invention can make a difference in our everyday lives.

The Facial Action Coding System can be very effective on teachers in a classroom. Some teachers might have a hard time understanding if the student is grasping onto the content or not. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrector. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive." This could dramatically help the teachers and students become more successful. It can help identify emotions that a person is feeling, without verbally having to say what is going on.

This is a valuable technology that can greatly impact the world. Identifying specific emotions for what a person is feeling can do a great deal of help. "According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them." This invention will help make life a lot easier for a lot of people.
