In the article, the author does present a lot of postitives and negative aspects of driverless cars. In my opinion, i am for the development of these cars. technology keeps growing and spreading wider each day. In the article it says how these cars are already on the way of being developed, Goolgle has had cars that could drive indepedently, but only under certain conditions. Googles cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash, so you know that the "Driverless Cars" will be safe.

I personally think that these cars would benifit people and the world in many ways. Gooogle cofounder Sergey Brin says that the cars he foresees would use half of the fuel of todays taxis and that it could offer way more flexibility then a bus, these cars would fundamentally change the world. Plus driving would be at at a way lower risk of car accidents, because it is a smart computer telling the car what to do. The "driverless cars" have already made alot of progress and alt of diffrent companies are trying to make these, as safe and as fast as possible.

The company BMW announced the develpoment of the "Traffic Jam Assistant" in 2013. The car can Brake, steer, and accelerate all by themselves. The person in the car has to have his or her hands on the wheel at all times because they are not made completly driverless yet, but they are getting more advanced every year, and i believe that someday driverless things will be a thing, and i hope it is. More lives will be safe. Less gas will be used so its better for our enviroment. If people are angry or have had to much to drink they can get home safley and with out an accident.
