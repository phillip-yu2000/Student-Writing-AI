In the article "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" , Luke joined , or signed up , for the Seagoing Cowboys. This job was to do hard work overseas to help with cattle and feed.

On their way, Luke went and seen different places,like China! Convincing others to participate in this important job would be hard. I think it would be hard because it is hard work. You also have to go overseas , away from your family and friends.

It would be hard to convince people to participate, or help. This is because, it is hard work, and your always busy. Here is an example from the article,"His job was to check on all the animals every hour." That proves that he is always busy. "But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs." That is an example that he is hard working.

They have to go overseas to Greece to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. Here is an example from the text, "They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece." People would miss their friends and family. They would also be sore from all the hard work they have to do.

Luke was greatful from start to end. In the beginning he was greatful to participate. In the middle, he done hard work , visited and saw great experiances. In the end, he was sore but really greatful for his part. "I'm greatful for the opportunity." he says. "It made me more aware of people of other countriesand their needs." That was an example in the text.

But best of all, he helped. These were some reasons and examples of why it would be sort of difficult to convince others , or people, to participate and take part in helping.
