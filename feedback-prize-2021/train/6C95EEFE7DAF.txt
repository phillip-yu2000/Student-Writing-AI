"The Face''

As we all know in the year of 1976 Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo which was belived to be a "face'' formed in Mar's surface. There has also been arguments over the years if "the face" was created by aliens or was it just a natural landform. Here is why I belive it is a natural landform.

In the article "Umasking the Face on Mars, in paragraph 12 it says what the picture that the picture actually shows that the Martian is equaivalent to a butte or messa which are landforms common around the American West. Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion. Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ," As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.

Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.

In conclusion, I belive that "The Face" was a just a natural landform. I belive this because of the eveidence that NASA provided and the fact that they went back to space and took anthor picture with up to date technology.
