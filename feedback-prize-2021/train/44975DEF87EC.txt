I think that we shoud include this type of technology into the classrooms. So that this way we could know what a student is thinking about the subject he is learning. If he/she is bored the teacher can maybe think of a way to make the class a bit more fun or entertaining in a way. The text states "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor." This type of technology could also help with class debates were the teacher says something like who ever wants pizza raise your hand and who ever wants salad raise your hand. Which ever one gets the most votes is what we will eat. And some where between the kid some one might say make sure to vote for pizza or else were not friends anymore and with the machine we could detect if a kid is truthful to what they voted for.
