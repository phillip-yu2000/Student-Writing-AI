My idea will be not let the students bring their cell phones to school. They should not bring their cell phones to school because if they use their cell phones during class they will get distracted and they wont do their work. The students wont do there work and also they will get distracted from texting. Also if the principal and the school districts would of let the schools in the county would of let the schools and the students use there cell phones during class CST test scores would of been low and also there grades would of been low. If the schools would of let the students use there cell phones the students could cheat off a test by going on the internet and going on GOOGLE and asking them the test questions and getting the answers.

Next if they would of let them use the cell phones the teachers would of had to deel with the students taking pictures during class. It would of been distracting for the teachers because the students would not let the teachers teach. Also it would of been distracting for the students not to learn. What else would of been distracting would of been the phones ringing during class and the music ring tones it would of been distracting for them and the students trying to learn and it would stop the teachers from teaching.

Last if we kept it the way we have it whright now students could learn teachers could teach and no one couyld have a proble
