Would you rather want a teacher-designed summer project or would you rather design your own summer project?

Well In my opinion I think summer projects should be a teacher-designed because It can be easier for kids and more kids would most likely complete their projects faster.

Having a teacher-designed project can be very easier for kids who dont like doing any work. For example, some people are really lazy and just need a little push, so If any teacher consider doing a teacher-designed project It will give the kids the push they need to completing their project. Even though kids like to complain alot maybe this would stop them from complaining and actually finish there project, you also can get a good grade.

Another reason to having a teacher-designed project will be more kids will be able to complete their projects faster. For example, I dont like doing projects because It take me to long to complete, I will probably miss the dead line to turn It in,and even though Its my design It takes time. If my teacher was helping me In some type of way I would complete my project faster,turn It In on the dead line, and get a good grade on It.

Some people say that student-designed projects can get you thinking or you can be creative. However It will take you way longer to complete. For example, If I was doing a project I would have to think about what I wanted to do and get my supplies that I would need, but If it was a teacher-designed project all I would have to do Is get the supplies I needed to complete the project.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by your teacher because it can be easier and more kids will complete their projects faster. Know you have read my response teachers should try to consider making summer projects that Is more teacher-designed then student-designed.
