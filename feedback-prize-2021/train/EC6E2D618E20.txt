I do not believe that distance learning would benefit students. the reason for this is that there are too many distractions that students face today, such as, cellphones, television, and just the internet as a whole.

Cellphones are a major distraction due to the fact that they can be taken and used anywhere. due to this students are easily distracted. Cellphones also can recieve call and texts at any time.

T.V. is a distraction because students can have a conference open and not pay attention to it. Because of so many shows and specials taking place at all times, it may be hard to work in a conferes between shows. The internet is a major distraction because in an online conference someone can easily open up a new tab and do whatever they want not learn anything.

These are the reasons why i think distance learning wouldn't be beneficial to students. With so many distractions and the immatureness of students i think it would be better to have a student learn in person.
