Imagine you are on the road at a red light and all of a sudden you get rammed in the back by a truck going 60 mph and now you are injured and your car is totaled. All of this happened because a teen was too busy on their phone texting their friend on snapchat.

I do not believe that the use of your cellphone to text or play games on should be allowed on the road because so much can happen in the blink of an eye while using them. Personally I've never experienced being in a car crash but I know that a car crashing into you going even 30 mph is going to do physical damage not only to the car but to your own body.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create.

I do believe that people should be allowed to make phone calls via voice but any use of the device can cause a huge hazard to yourself and others. A car can travel the length of 2 football fields in the time span of 5 seconds, and that's approximately how long it takes to send a message. If you only make phone calls that will prevent the need to glance at your phone and respond to it as well. Especially in this age we have devices that will respond to your voice when you say "Call Dad!"

it will call dad hands free without risking your life and the life of others.
