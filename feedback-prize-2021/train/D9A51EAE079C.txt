I see driverless cars both dangerous and useful. They can help the dissabled and many people who can't drive at diffrent parts of the day.

People that would have driverless cars would be both lazy and easily angered at the car. The lazyness would come from the fact that they just have to sit in the car, and the anger would come when they had to put their hands on the wheel when the car wouldn't be able to drive its self.

The cars would need the human to direct it in the correct way at times it can't and the humans would be angry at the car when this happnes. Also the humans wouldn't see the point of having to take a driver's test. The humans would be angry at the licencing branch and the branch would go out of work because they don't have to test people.

Honestly, I think this would only be good for only a small amout of people, however if only a select few can use the cars the other people that can't would be angry. I think this could be harmful for the population, but this is only my idea others might find it helpful.
