Viking 1 photo was taken in 1976 and had people believing all sorts of things. It apperred to be a human face, but was not yet proven to be one. Some belived that is was just a natural landform, but which one is it? This mask on Mars was soon unmasked on May 24, 2001, and is proven to be a natural landform. They have used better pictures and comparison from Earth.

Using pictures to discorver the "Face on Mars" was difficult in 1976 because we did not have high tech cameras to prove anything, but as the years gone by we could soon tell the truth. For example, 22 years later Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) was able to take a picture of the figure ten times sharper. After this picture was taken, more people were able to believe that this mask on Mars was just natural landform. Then 3 years later in 2001 we had taken another picture that was even closer and it diffinetly showed landform.

Yes, the "Face on Mars" was discorvered to be a mesa, or landforms common around the American West. With all these pictures from 1976 to 2001, we had compared them to these Earth landforms. For example, Garvin says that it reminds him of most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

This mysterious figure on Mars had turned out to be just natural landform called a mesa. The evidence and details have proven that through pictures and comparison. There is no longer a need to believe any alien monument or life on Mars. Sure, the viking 1 photo gave an illusion, but the MGS image from 2001 gives more evidence to what it really is. Thanks to Malin's teams, that caputured an extraodinary photo to prove the truth.
