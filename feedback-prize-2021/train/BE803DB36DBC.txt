Dear principal,

I think that cell phones should be aloud at school because their are various reasons why students would need a phone. What if a student's parents needed to call them and the didn't have the school's phone number? What if a student accidentally missed the bus and they need to call their parents? What if their was an accident at the school and the student needed to call someone? Their are a wide variety of reasons for a student to have cell phone at school which i will go into more detail about.

What if a student's parent needed to call him/her to tell them that they're not going to be at the house and the key is under the mat. What if the parent wanted to tell the student that they're going to pick the student up after school and the student's all ready let the school on the bus? What if one of the student's parents died and needed to contact them? These are logical reasons.

What if the student wanted to contact the parent and tell them that there was no school and to come to pick them up? What if the student needed a medication and needed to contact the parent? What if the student needed help with getting a project home and needed to contact the parent? These reasons are valid.

What if the student's school was on fire and needed to contact you? What if the school was at a threat? What if the school was under lockdown and the student needed to call the parent? These are reasonable reasons.

I hope principal that you would reconsider banning cell phones after reading these reasons.
