My opinion on driverless cars is that it is a good thing for everyone. If we had a public- transport taxi system, we wouldn't have to use as much fuel if it goes the way Sergey Brin envisions this. In 2009 Google had them independent under specific conditions. These cares have been driven up to half a million miles without a crash. These cars would change everyones daily function in a positive way.

Google has also modified Toyota Prius to use position- estimating sensors, rotating sensors on the roof, video cameras mounted near rearview mirrors,there is alot of technology in this car but there is something way more important in this car. It is a spinning sensor on the roof, Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the cars surroundings and you could use that if the car was driverless. You could do this to see where to have the car go if it is auto.

In 2013, BMW announced the development of Traffic Jam Assistant. The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 Mph, but special sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. These can steer acurate and break themselves, this is a machanic that driverless cares will have to have. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving- Driverless 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have plans to have cars to drive themselves by 2020.

Driverless cars will help tramendasley with everyday people that need to go somewhere but cant drive, teens without a license, elderly people who cant drive anymore many people. When this gets here I hope i can test this out for myself because it would be a positive side to everything driving. By 2020 many car brands will have this in there hands and everyone elses hands.
