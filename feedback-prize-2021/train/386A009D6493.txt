Being a Seagoing Cowboy let Luke see all over the world and help people in need. He had the most fun on his home with the other Seagoing Cowboys. They would play Base baseball and volleyball in the empty hold of the animals been housed. They would aslo play table-tennis touranments,

fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. When he turned 18 he wsa his way to Greece (as a Seagoing Cowboy) and he got draft. When they found out he was a Seagoing Cowboy they said he could do his service as a Seagoing Cowboy.

It opend up the world to him. He got to see the Acropolis in Greece and he rode up in Venic, Italy were the streets are water. Helping out on his Aunt's farm helped him for the hard work as a Seagoign Cowboy but it didn't help for the danger of the sea. It made him more awar of peole in other countries that need help and that stayed with him for life and he shared that wiht his family. He always said it was more than just an adventure.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy can be fun at times but can be realy hard at some parts. It helps for life like school does. I think that more peole sould get a try to become a Seagoing Cowboy just to learn soem of the same thing Luck did or see the things he might have seen. So give it a try it can be fun!
