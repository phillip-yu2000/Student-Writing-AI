Cars without drivers are the future. It will allow many things to become obsolete but for good cause. It may be because of the recreational aspect of there being too much stress in extended periods of driving. It could also be because of the added safety that these cars will create for the occupants and pedestrians. Either way, people will begin to see the wonders that is driverless cars.

There are an abundance of people that dislike driving for extended periods of time. This will make road trips much more bearable so that the driver does not have to use all of his or her concentration solely on driving.

Although, the driverless cars of the present are not truly driverless. They still rely on humans to do some of the work to go around speific things like accidents or complicated traffic issues. As such, it may not be perfect, but it does more work so that the driver does not have to. This was partially the goal of driverless cars.

If these cars become a reality and the need of human drivers becomes obsolete, accidents will be greatly reduced. Perfected driverless cars can lead people into an era where people do not have have to rely on their cars to not let them die in an accident. Instead, we will rely on the vehicles to not cause an accident. It will also cause drunk driving to become a thing of the past because the car will do the driving in place of the drunken person. Rather than thinking solely of the recreational aspects, the safety that comes with these cars will cause them to become adopted into states more easily.

As such, driverless cars should be sought after by companies and people so that they worry less on the road and its dangers and more on having a family friendly time in cars like sedans.
