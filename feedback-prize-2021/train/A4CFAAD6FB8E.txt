My opinion is that i think there are no other life forms on any planet but planet Earth. I also think it's just an natural landform.

In 1976, the technolohy wasn't good, so you could be staring at any thing from that photo. In the artical it says "few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact". Those scientists did a lot of research on that photo so if they say its not an alien artifact i believe them.

In 1998, when the MGS took another photo of the "Face" . You can see there is no face on the planet is wasn't an alien monument on it. It is just a natural landform.

2001, the MGS took another photo of the "Face" and it revealed an extrodinary photo. By this time the technology has gotten way better. You can see that the photo shows an "Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa". Those are common landforms around the America West.

Inconclusion, the 1998 and the 2001 photos show its just and natural landform. It isn't made by aliens it's not an alien monument.
