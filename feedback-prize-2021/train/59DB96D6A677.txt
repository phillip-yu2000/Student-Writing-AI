Dear Principal,

Wouldn't you like to keep the community at its beauty? Community service is really good for the community and our self-being, but not all of us have the time and will to help out. That's why i don't think that community service is required for all students. I will tell you why I think this is so, and i urge you to keep reading.

There are many things you can do for community service. like cleaning up your city, park, beach, or any public place that you live near. You wouldn't want your home to be messy and unmanageable, right? So why shouldn't you keep your surroundings magnificent, helping keep your city beautiful is something everyone should want to do. Helping out children in need academically is another form of community service. Children should be well educated for a better future, and maybe help your community when he or she possibly becomes successful in their later years.

But sometimes people don't have the time to help out. That person could live a really busy life. your job or getting done what need to be done should be something more important than helping other people. Or maybe they're the ones who need the help with their academics. Sometimes people just want to relax and take it easy for a while.

community service is a good thing for yourself and the community, but you should take other people's needs into consideration. That's why its shouldn't be required for students to perform community service.

regards,
