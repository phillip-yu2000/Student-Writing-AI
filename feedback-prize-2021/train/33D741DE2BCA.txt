I think that students should not be able to use cell phones during lunch periods or other free periods because students do not need to use their phones during lunch if they're already with their friends, and students will get tempted to use them during class. Another reason why I think they shouldn't be aloud at school at all is because if you give us more freedom to use our phones it would be more likely that students would loose their phones or phones would get stolen.

If students are at lunch with all of their friends I don't think they would need their cell phones because all of their friends are right there, they can walk over to a friend if they want to talk to them. It would make lunch time less social because every student would be attached to their cell phones, plus some people don't even have cell phones so how do you think that makes them feel?

Also, if students are allowed to use cell phones anywhere except the classrooms I think students will get too tempted and use their phones during class. During free periods students can be doing something useful for example, doing class work or studying.

Lastly, I think students should not be allowed to have cell phones in school at all is because it is more likely if you give us the freedom to use our phones students would leave them out somewhere and loose their phones. Also cell phones can be easily stolen or lost. That would lead to a lot of conflict for everybody in the school

In conclusion, I think that students should not be able to have cell phones at school at all because students wouldn't need to use them during lunch because all of their friends are right there with them, students would get tempted and use them during class time, and it is more likely for people to loose their cell phones or get them stolen.
