Dear Principal:

Your idea of changing the school policy about having a grade B average, to participate in sports and other activities, I would have to agree with. For if you do the students of this school will surely keep their grades up and strive for excellence more then they do today. To have this new policy come in students will think twice about letting a C go by as a good grade. Also the students (because of this rule) will have a much better future than the students who think grades are a joke.

When you are a principal of a school of course you want the kids grades to go up if they already haven't. For it definitely brings up the schools grade point average making the school look much better for future students and parents.

Also today students don't really care about a bad grade. they would just toss their graded quiz paper aside and move on. While they really should fix their mistakes and get that paper turned back in for a better grade. Sure it would be nice to allow kids, who have a C in every subject, participate in an exciting sport or activity but the truth is that would really hurt their future. the reason it would hurt them is because if you allow them electives the will get a certain thought stuck in their head that they will live by and that is "Hey I can get a lot of bad grades and I'm still invincible.

To allow this grand rule come the school will be a much better and smarter place then how it is now. So please do think about allowing this rule to come to action to save the students who are creating a terrible future for themselves. For it won't only improve their grades but also their attitude towards learning as well.
