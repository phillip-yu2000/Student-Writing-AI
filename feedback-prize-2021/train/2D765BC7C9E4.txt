Dear Reader

I would say yes to having an extracurricular activity in school cause it could be healthy, could get you to quit being lazy, and might teach you a valuable lesson for the future. The reason why I may think this could be a benefit to your life is because it helped me alot. You should try it at some point and see how you like it.

People ask all the time how is this healthy. I think this is healthy because in some of the activities you are getting exercise. Exercise is helping people lose weight everyday. If you think about it can also help your body for lots of things. Dont put your body in to much pain though.

It might help people with their lazyness although they still might reject sports. It could get them up out of bed to talk with some new really good freinds. It might honestly do a lot of things like they actually have fun. It would definietly get some kids off the video games. Like my Brother for example. What do you think about how this can also get kids off other things?

I know some of these things has definitly tought me some valuable lessons for the future. I mean you could change this world.

With these lessons in your head, it could change your family if you share, or teach the lessons to them. Have you ever learned a valuable lesson in life from a extracurricular activities?

These are my reasons for why I would have kids in school have the extracurricular activities for their health,

lazyness, and last but not least, the lessons they could learn.
