Cell Phones haven't been around a long time, so people think they are the best thing yet. People use phones for everything. Surprisingly people are using them at the wrong times, causing car accidents and other accidents. Driving while texting or even talking sometimes on the phone is not safe at all. All of this makes it extremely hard to focus on the road and your surroundings.

Therefore, since driving and texting is illegal, and people still do it, there are now fines and tickets people have to pay if they are caught or even suspected to be on their phone while driving. Most drivers cannot maintain the same speed when they aren't focused on the road so the other drivers will either be so close to them or get mad and speed around them. There have been reports of 36% of drivers who admit to being on their phones while driving. 14% of that 36% ended up in a deadly wreck.

In conclusion, I think it is best to stay off your phone while driving. This could save so many lives of innocent people. This would also save so much time and money that cops and ambulances have to put into coming to help someone who should've just followed the laws to begin with.
