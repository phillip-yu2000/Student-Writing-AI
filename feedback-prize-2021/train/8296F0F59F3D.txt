Dear Principle,

I believe that you should leave our school policy how it is. There are many good reasons to do so. First most of the students have a Grade C average. Next, there would be hardly any team mates for our sports. And, finally, the students will then want to go to a different school.

To start off with, most kids don't have a grade B average. Any student who has less than a grade B average will feel left out. Also, over half of our school would get less exercise and will not go outside at all. Plus, these students will not be able to hang out with their smarter friends because they will be at practice or at games all the time.

Second, the teams will have close to no players. All of the school athletes will have too low of a grade to participate. This will cause our teams to be horrible. Then, in games, the teams will not be able to play because there will be hardly any players.

Lastly, the students will want to go to other schools. Most other schools may not have this policy. Slowly our school will get smaller and smaller. We will not be able to afford team sports, clubs, or any other extra-curricular activities. Not to speak of buses or renaissance rallies.

I would like to ask you to please consider my statements. I'm sure all the other students would agree with what i have said. Thank you for taking the time to read my reasons for disliking your idea of changing the school policy.
