The author suggests that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the author wants to study and know everything about venus. Like how Venus is Earths twin they have the same density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too but the arouth is willing to take risks knowing that a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus and on the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahreheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater then what they experience on earth them conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter. Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet its beyond high pressure an heat NASA worked on other approaches to study venus they simplified electronics made of silicon carbide it lasted 3 weeks in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus which are erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. But the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becaues human curiosty will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors.
