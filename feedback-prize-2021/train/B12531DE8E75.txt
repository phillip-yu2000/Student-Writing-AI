The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining the similarities between the Earth and how we can overcome our differences as well.

The author believes it is worthy of a shot because of the ways to avoid major problems, such as flying at a high altitude to evade the extreme pressure of the atmosphere and dangerous sulfuric acid clouds. The text states, "Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans." This piece of evidence shows how clever the author is willing to get to investigate Venus and just how possible this may actually be. The text also states, "...not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equallty intimidating endeavors." This evidence goes to show that not he is not interested in exploring the planet to purely learn about the planet itself, but it is also human curiosity that pushes us as a race to adventure and discorver things that are of the unknown.

In conclusion the author strongly supports the idea of pursuiting the exploration of Venus despite the dangers it presents. Although as the author stated, it is better to think of these "dangers" as challenges, as we can overcome them and reach our goal. We have the potential and technology to get there, we just need to put our heads together and do it.
