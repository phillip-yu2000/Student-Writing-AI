The author supports the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it shows. In paragraph 2 the supports his claim by informing us that "Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms- humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world". Although no spacecrat survived the landing for more than a couple hours. This adds on to why in Paragraph 3 that, "on the pantes surface, tempatres average over 800 degrees Farhrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet". Another reason in paragraph 3 is that "Venus has the hottest surface tempatre o any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun".

The author then supports his reasoning of Venus being worthy of exploring with an idea by NASA in paragraph 5 that despite the hostile planet conditions of the surface "Venus would llow scientst to float above the fray". the author explains to us a vehicle that will be able to hover 30 or so miles above Venus's hostile conditions. he also explains it as "just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendl ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Even though tempatures would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the pressure would be similar to those at sea level of Earth, supported by solar energy. Altough the author does bring up insight that the vehicle will only have imited information, and it is just another challenge that many researcher are working on to innovate.
