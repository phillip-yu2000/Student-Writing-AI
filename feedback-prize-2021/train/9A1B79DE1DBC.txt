Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free time because their cell phones will be off during learning time. They won't feel the need to have to text during class. I'm sure there will be a decrease in the amount of complaints you receive from the teachers as to how many children continue to text in their classrooms. I believe you will be happy with how the numbers will change.

Also I believe that student may get a lot more work done in class without a lot of them texting. If they have time to read their text at passing time then they won't have to stop doing their work just to read their text. I'm sure the teachers get tired of repeating themselves constantly telling the students to put their phone away. constantly taking their phone. constantly calling their parents about it.

However, there may be students that will take this experience for granted. You can take that away form them which is only fair. But I'm positive this won't happen if you make this a school policy.

As you can see a lot of students grades can increase and the class texting rate will decrease if this policy was to happen. Please think about this. It may really change the school. There will a lot of honor roll students and less detentions.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
