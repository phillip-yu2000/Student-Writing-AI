Venus is Earth's neighbor its right around the corner from us. No spacecraft has been able to land on it in more than three decades and they only survived for a few hours. We have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world and each mission was unmanned and for a good reason. Venus has been a hard planet for humans to study. A thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Venus is also surrounded by clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid it is also in Venus's atmosphere. The planets surface temperatures can reach over 800 degrees fahrenheit. Also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we have here on Earth. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in our solar system. Astronomers are very very interested in Venus because it may have been one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. Venus has a surface that could of once had a rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as vallyes, mountains, and possibly at one point and time craters. NASA is going to create a vehicle that can float above the dangerous parts of Venus and that can provide humans to get some insight on the planet so that we can see if we can learn more about it . This will provide only limited but little insight on the planet. Researches will not be able to leave the spacecraft to get samples of rock because of the dangers of the planet wich makes there job a lot more difficult. Scientist today are trying to build a peace of spacecraft that can last longer on Venus's surface so that scientists can get samples of what they need to learn more about the planet. One day scientists will for sure figure out how to build machines to get better insight on Venus and see everything this buetiful but extreamly dangerous planet is all about.
