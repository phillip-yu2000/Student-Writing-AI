I think the author supports his idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because he tells why he agree with this but explaing that it isn't that different for Earth and that it used to have Oceans and could have supported like forms. He also explains that it would not be a good idea because it would be 170 degrees Fahrenheit and would won't be able to survive in that heat. He says both sides of the point so they can see where is he doubting this topic.

In some places he says that is would be a lot of money and it might not be worth the effort to build things for so many years and not even get to collect data. The things NASA is sending to space to look at Venus is only from a distance, this causes then to not collect as much data so see if humans are ableto live her.

I think that if we have the right materials then we should be able to see if life forms like animals and humans can live here. I think that NASA should study it up close even if it takes a lot of money because if we had to option to have two planets then that would be good. This would be good because if anything happens to earth where we need a new planet or it gets destroyed then we could move to Venus and start new life. I agree with the author and think that trying this out would be good for humans as they upgrade each generation.
