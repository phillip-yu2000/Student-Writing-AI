My Opinion

My opinion is that student's shouldn't be allowed to have phones in school because it disrupts the learning process of other people. A lot of

kids have phones because their parent's want to know if they are okay and safe but if they are in school they will be safe because it's the school's responsibility and that's why they have camera's and security guards, and if their not in school the school calls the parent's to ask why their son or daughter didn't go to school , and the parent's will know if their son or daughter showed up to school or ditched.

Also instead of talking on the phone at lunch they can be hanging out with their friends or studying for a test . Sometimes kids forget to turn off their phone and it rings in the middle of the class it disrupts the kids around them. And it stops the teacher from teaching because she has to take the phone away and give the consequences . It is disturbing because everyone stops learning because a kid forgot to turn of his phone.

School is made to learn not to talk at lunch and text during class. It also stop the learning process of themselves because they are more concerned about getting a call at lunch or a text message that they wont pay attention to their studies and when a test comes they won't know what to answer because they weren't paying attention. For example let's say a girl named PROPER_NAME was on too busy on the phone and didn't study for her test the next day, She will copy the person sitting next to her , and what if that person is guessing on all the questions ? PROPER_NAME and her neighbor both failed that test.

I also think it's unfair because some kids spend all their time studying for a test and a person ,who didn't even bother to open their book to study, is going to copy them. I think everyone's opinion count's and noone should be left unheard because one change can make a world difference
