If driverless cars use less gas, polute less, and do not crash, I'm sure everyone would love to have them. The problem is that they might crash. Companies may state that their car will not crash, but people are reluctant to believe them.

If a car is 90% comupter driven, the only thing it is saving is stress the driver might build up while driving. The driver still has to be aware if their surroundings and still might have to take control. If the car was 100% coputer driven, I think more people would want one. If it was only computer driven, people could be more productive in the car. They could maybe get some work done or make important phone calls. Human error is always possible, but so is computer error. If money wasn't a factor, we'd already have smarter cars or smarter roads.

The only people who will want to be able to drive their car are people who don't trust the car, or peopole who want to speed and drift. If the cars were computer driven, they probably would go over the speed limit, unless a little computer error happens. If a computer driven car crashes, people will lean further away form the idea. I support the fact that they are trying to make them driverless. I would only trust them if they are proven to do little to no crashes.
