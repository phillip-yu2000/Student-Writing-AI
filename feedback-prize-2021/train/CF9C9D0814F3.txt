Since the day the first car was made cars have only gotten better. Now there are hundreds of different cars with differents styles and purposes. Recently driverless cars have been added to the list. Yes, cars that drive them selves are finally here.

In my opinion driverless cars are a great idea. Imagine if u could just sit back and relax while your car is casually stolling through traffic. In paragrapgh 2 it says the cars arent truly driverless. Which i think is a good thing. If our car was 100% driverless we wouldnt have controll of how we get to places. And what if your car accidently makes a wrong turn. You should have the power to put it back on the desired path.

Driverless cars are closer to being apart of every day life than we think. Google has been developing self driving cars since 2009. Imagine the progress they will have made in 2020. Yes driverless cars have negative aspects but the positives are just to much to ignore. Driver less cars are indeed the future.
