I think it would be helpful for students in the text it says that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomeing confused or bored, ''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. I know how that feels when you get that way when you are on a lossen and you dont understand a lesson. but some people might not like that because they might be contused or bored but they might like to have a chaleng and if they chang the lesson to make it esery they might get frostrated at the program.

you have to think about the other sied of this argumint some you might be mad a some one else or be upset about some thing else and the computor might think you are upset with the lesson a chang it and everyone shows there emotions deffrint so how would the conpter know how you show yours , and it does say in the text that is still working on the moldel of the face. it says that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. And that might take awiel.

I would love for this to work someday i think it would help me alot because i hate useing computers i like haveing a techer tech me and if i could have a computer that asked like a humen and knew when i was confused with a lossen and help me with it or even chang it to a lees cofusing losson that would be grusgt so i hope this works one day.
