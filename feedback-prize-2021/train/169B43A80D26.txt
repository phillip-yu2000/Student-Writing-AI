Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience. You don't only help people, but you also get a benefit of seeing amazing places. If you love animals you can take care of them. You get to have fun and know that you're doing something that helps others.

Luke was just a small town boy and he got a great opportunity. First he had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank. Luke was invited to be a Seagoing Cowboy by his friend Don. He accepted it and knew he was going to have a lifetime opportunity. Luke had a benefit of seeing Europe and China, saw the Acropolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

This job may be fun, but it still is a life changing experience. You see more than you could see just from home. You also know you're changing other people's lives. Luke may have had a wonderous adventure, but it also made him more aware of the needs in other countries.
