This rule is foolish! I disagree with the principal, I believe that it is not required for a student to participate in a extracurricular activity. Although it is a good for them to participate if they want to. Students should at least have a choice between participating in a activity or not.

You may be asking "How does an activity distract students?". If they are doing a activity, their time is less flexible. This means that they won't turn in work on time or even worse, not doing schoolwork at all. This is exactly what happened when the principal forced me to join the book club. My grades went down because the book club took up the time that I used for doing work.

Also, If a student is already participating in activities he or she may not be able to attend these school activities that the principal is enforcing. When my principal started the rule, I had soccer practice everyday right after school. When he announced that everybody has to participate in a activity after school, I didn't know what to do. I talked to my mom and she said that she won't allow me to stay after school to do something my principal wants me to do. She'd rather pay for something I liked doing and that was soccer.

In conclusion this rule is very unnecessary because it distracts students from doing school work, Students could have no time to do school activities and parents could be concerned.Â
