The author supports the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author thinks that if NASA could get close enough to the planet to study it they will have gained insight on the planet and will lead to human curiosoty into many equally intimidating endeavors. The author believes it will be valueble even though there are challenges it presents which include high temperatures, the pressure, and a thick atmosphere.

A challenge of studying venus presents include high temperatures of 800 degrees. There is also a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide which also contains clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. A big problem that NASA faces with landing on Venus is the pressure that the planet has. The pressure there is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth.

If NASA found a way to solve those problems than they could learn valuable information about Venus.

The author believes that Venus has a lot of information that NASA could still learn about the planet. Information such as; what causes the erptions of volcanoes or why is it so Earth like? The author states that scientists are fasinated by the fact that its the closest planet to be like Earth in our solor system. The author also states that, "Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various life forms, just like earth." If this is true NASA could believe that there might be other planets that are just like ours.

The author supports the idea of Venus being worth studying even if there are risks. THe author believes that if NASA could get close enought to the planet they coul see if there were truely other life forms other than earths. The author supports the idea of it being valuble by saying, "Not only would we gain insight of mars but also lead human curiosity into many equally intimidating endeavors. "
