Dear Principal,

In the policy containing that students should not have a grade C average to participate in school sport programs that they enjoy or any other school related activities should be changed to having a grade B average.

If you allow them to be apart of something they enjoy and care about then they shouldn't have a grade C average. Students that do what they enjoy and care about such as sports and or school activities should care enough to make the good grades for those activities. Being in those activities and sports is a privilege. Not something that is just given to you. They should care enough to make the required grades if they really wanted to play that sport or activity. Let the student know that they should have better grades in order to play the sport. It's up to them to get that grades to play the game or be in the activity. If they want to continue playing the sport or activity then they should get the grades required such as a grade B average. By telling the students that they should have a grade B average lets them know that they need to work harder to succeed. By working hard to get what they want is a great experience for the student so it teaches them to focus on whats important and be responsible for there work and what they care about. Later in life they may not have much trouble doing what needs to be done and getting it done with ease.

The policy in my opinion should be changed to the requirements of having a B average in order to play school sports and participating in school activities.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
