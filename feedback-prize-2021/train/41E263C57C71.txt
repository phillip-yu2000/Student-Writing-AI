Dear state senator,

I very much think that the voting of the president should be changed to popular vote rather than the electoral college. There is too many things that can go wrong with he electoral college. If popular vote is taking place, it solves many problems. For examble, the electoral college does'nt have to vote for the president they were chose for, and a tie could end up happening because the votes are even at 538.

Many important people of the government have tried to abolish the electoral college at times, including Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole. There is many flaws within the electoral college. Like in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but then lost the electoal vote, if this is a government based on what the people want, then popular vote should by far be appointed over the electoral college.

In 1976 a tie could of been very possible, if 5,559 voters in ohio would of voted oppisite, and 3,687 would of voted oppisite, there would of been a complete disaster in the election. In 2000, people in 25 of the biggest media states didnt get to see any campaign adds, also voters in 17 states didnt even see the candidates at all!

Some people feel that if there was a popular voting for the president, there would be many disputes, but if this is a democracy and the government is ran by the people, then the popular vote is by far better than the electoral college.

All in all, popular vote is just the better way to go, it'll be what the people want, and there wont be any questions asked about the outcome of the election.
