The reason why she should not do that is because a lot of people do like sports and don't have good grades.

And some times kids only go to school because of there sports.

If she would have done that there would be no team sprit and no one will come to there games because there will be nobody playing.

I say most of the kids only get those grades is because they just don't under stand it so the teachers don't understand what there going threw.

And some kids are special in some things and they will probably not get to try it because of there grades.

There is no reason to make it into a B average because if its a C you can still pass that class but not with a high grade.

Most people get kicked out of the sports because of there grade we don't need more people getting kicked put because of that.

The main reason why they shouldn't do that is because people just cant get high grades if the way there teacher act.

If there teachers don't act good then the students will probably have a problem with they act and do the stuff on purpose if they act they way they want to act.

so that's why i think they shouldn't make it to a B average.
