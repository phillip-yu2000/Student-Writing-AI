Exploring Venus will be a good idea. It is the closets plant to Earth astronomers have found, even though Venus is a very challenging planet to examine because the planet is dangerous and unstable. In the article," A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere" (3). Exploring Venus might give NASA a reason to believe how the planet is so closely related to Earth. Therefore, despite the dangers Venus produces it was once just like Earth, the planet had charcteristics and life forms that are similar to Earth, now the planet still has some of those characteristics but is dangerous.

The author stated, "Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary vist" (4), with all NASA's visits into space Venus would be the closet plant to Earth resoulting to where astronoauts don't have to make a long trip, but how will the get on the planet? NASA has been trying to create a safe but effective way to study the planet so they can travel on the planet safety despite the dangers it holds. NASA has been working on complicated technology and has been going back to WWll technology to help with ways to get onto the planet with out losing a person.

Finding ways to explore Venus despite its dangers may be benificial to Earth explaining what might have happened to the planet. Was it always dangerous? What if something abnormal happened to Venus resoulting in why the planet is so dangerous. Studying Venus wll open our minds and answer all our questions and putting people onto that dangerous planet might give us hope, hope that if we can study Venus then that is saying how we are evolving and that we could find a way to get onto any planet despite the challenges we might encounter.
