The need for these car free suburbs are very imprtant because the more cars that we take off the road the less green house gas fumes are released. Different means of trying to clear the air have been taken,in some countries on certain days people with even numbered licence palts have to leave then other days odd numbers have to leave their cars. So sume places take it very serious people fail to notice that we are killing our planet we have have to do everything possible that we can to save our planet because we won't have another chance to do so.

A few places around the world have band cars for a day or two so that people would take alturnitive transportation like taxi's or buses so that people are aware that there are other means of transportation so that it can re duce greenhouse gas. Mayors from the bordering cities have come to see what all of the comotion was about and they loved the idea so much that they sre starting to take a stand on the issue.

Studies show that less and less people are driving so that shows that people may or may not be able to purchase a car or just decide that they don't want a car and enjoy taking other means of transportation. I beleave that it is good to car pool or ride the bus but some people might have to own a car or ride the bus so that they can get to work. Some people may not have the money to own a car so they have to ride the bus or take a taxi to work or school everyday. so it doesn't bother them so think about the people who own their own cars or don't have time to wait for the bus or a taxi to take them to work. some people have very busy live and don't have time to wait for people to come and pick them up. so thats one big reason.
