Article one was about electeralÂ college and how it works. It explanined to us how when presidents get elected they have there own party to vote for them and, how the goverment has to prepare a certificat of ascertainment listing all candidates who ran for presadient in your state alony with the names of their respective electors.

Article two was about the electeral college, and why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. well in differnt places or state's you would vote for a cernten person supposably all fifty states are differnt some are republicans and some are democarts. so the states that are democrats are the ones that would vote ofr the democrats and the ones that are republinacs would vote for there kind and hopefuly there kind would win.

So i feel that both of the aritcles are the same but personally i thinkthat the first article has more support and more detail. I honestly dont have no idae what the heck Electeral college is it takes more than just two little articlesto tell me what something is. but I think I will have tosay i would like to vote to keep it beacuse it sounds ok from what i've read i maen. It is like i said if I had more information on it and understood what it really maent and what it was for I would be abke to give u a more striaght foward answer. But i do have to say I think we should keep it beacuse it looks like something good and something worth giving a shoot but form where my family is and what they belive i am going to have to go with there choice of who the go for or what they go for which they are republicans so therefor we r going to want nothing but republican to win. I mean not saying i will ever go my own way but i am just not ready to go and pick which party i want to follow yet. So yes i am going to have to vote for the keeping and trying of this i think it is worth the shoot.
