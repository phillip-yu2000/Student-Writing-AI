I think that you should let kids use their phones during their free time through out the day. I think this because students still use them anyway so if u let them use it they wont have to hide or worry about getting their phone taken away. The students will also be happy that they can use their phones during their lunch time and other free time they get.

As a kid I like to talk to my friends during the school day. I don't like it when I have to hide from my teachers just so I can use my phone. If you would let us use our phones during school in our free time we would pay more attention in class. We would be paying attention to what the teacher said not to what our friends are saying to us on our cell phones.

I think you should try this policy out for a month to see if it helps students pay more attention and get better grades. If the policy does not work then you can remove it. I think you should try out the policy. It will also stop students from getting in trouble during class for using their phones, it could also get rid of disruptions during the class.

If you do decide to let us use our cell phones during class we might even get better grades on our test's. This is why I think that you should let us students use our cell phones during our free time. I hope that you consider the policy of letting students use their phones during free time.
