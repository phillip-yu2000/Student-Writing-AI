When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person for different opinions. It is a good thing to ask different people on their advice about a certain topic, because one person might say one thing but it might not be the best advice for you. So if you ask several people you can see what might be right for you to do.

Say you ask one person and you ask them if you should propose to someone and they really don't what your saying and they just say yes. Well if you told him that you just wanted their money and didn't really like the person for who they are. The guy said you should propose so you do and you end up getting divorced. But if you would of asked someone else's opinion they could have told you that you should not be doing this and it wont work out in the end.

Here is some other examples. If you want to know if you should get a certain gift for someone on their birthday it is good to ask people that know the person. Like if their a girl you can ask if they are into dolls or if they really like volleyball and get them a new volleyball to play with. Another example is if your at the store and its your first time shopping for avocados, you want to know which one to buy so you ask the person next to you. they say they prefer their avocado to be hard but still a little soft. You then go ask another person and they say they like theirs hard. You know have an idea on what avocado to get for the next time you go shopping.

When people ask for advice it is a great thing to ask for different opinions because it can really help with the outcome of what ever you need.
