Dear school principal,

I think you should go with Policy 1 because the students might need their cell phones after school, and during free times incase of emergency. The reasons for an emergency would possibly have to be ones such as "Your parents got into an accident." or "Somebody robbed your house." If the students don't have their cell phones during this time, then they will have to come home and either find their house destroyed and things missing, or their parents not home and in the hospital.

Students may also need their cell phones for after school rides. Like if their parents won't pick them up and they need to tell them, or a different relative is going to take them home. If the students were not allowed to bring cell phones at all, what would happen if one of them was the last one to go home and somebody held a gun to their face and told them to get in their car? These students would need to call 911, but if they don't have their cell phones, they would be in some big trouble.

Sometimes during school the students might have a lockdown incase of weather conditions like a tornado or hurricane. Then they would have to call their parents to make sure everyone in the house is safe.

Other reasons the students might need their phones is if they forget something at school and they need their parents to bring it right away. They might not be able to use the school phone because there is a line of people waiting to use it, or someone is already using it.

What would happen if a crazy person came to the school and shot students? The other students would need to inform their parents about things like this so they know they're safe. Most people in the world care about their children and their safety. If they know that something happened at their child's school and they cannot know if their child is safe or not, they will have a big meltdown.

These are just a few reasons on why you should have the school go with Policy 1.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
