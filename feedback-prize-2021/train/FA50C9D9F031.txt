I'm personally not for the self driving cars because i dont think they would be as safe as what the creators say they are and many things can happen as the car is driving itself. These cars can obviously save a lot of money for some people but they can also be dangerous in ways that people not might even think about.

These cars obviuously can save money from any point of a persons view but what happens if something goes wrong with the car and it doesnt respond to what the article says it should like construction. Would you hineslty trust a driverless car to take you places. The car could plow right through the area injuring people or even worse. What happens also if the break dont work or it just automatically starts accerlating to high speeds. Right there, people will be filing lawsuits or even sewing the makers becase someone in there family was hurt or killed. Sure the driver can take control over the car when needed but what if that deosnt happen and theres something wrong with the car. driverless cars can either help people or hurt people, but some people are just going to have to make that choice on what they want to do.

Driverless cars should not be allowed because if something goes wrong in can hurt people in so many different ways, and it could also destroy a family if someone gets hurt or dies. People need to realize that they would not be the safest cars. it shouldnt matter if there free, what should matter if there built to physically be safe and if something happens, the creaters will cover any tyoe of bills that need to be payed if something goes wrong with there creations.
