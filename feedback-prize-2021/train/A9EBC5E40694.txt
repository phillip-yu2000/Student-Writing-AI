Don't Take Our Sports!

Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

I write to you, to argue against your wanted new school policy on sports. I do not believe that student should not be able to participate in sports with out a B average. I find that very wrong to be completely honest with you, because from my point of view some students are only capable of a C average, because of a slight learning disabilities or any thing of that sort.

My point of view is that any student should be able to play a sport as long as they are passing, not just with a C average, with a passing average. I know there are some students that don't want to try in school, but try hard in sports. Doesn't mean you should punish the whole school because of them. I am a straight A student believing that this is unfair, even though I would be eligible to play because I have good grades.

But there are honestly people trying that just don't get it, and get lower grades because of the not understanding of the material. Or it could possibly be the teacher not teaching it a way the child understands it. I think you should be proud that your school is all obtaining a C average of above, and not punish them by taking there sports from them. Our school needs our athletes!

I hope you take all of what I am saying into consideration, and give us our sports, and not take them.

Thanks for all of your time,

STUDENT_NAME.
