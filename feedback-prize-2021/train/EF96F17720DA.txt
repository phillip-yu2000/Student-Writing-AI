Dear TEACHER_NAME

As our school policy is now we have to have a 76% or above in all your classes in order to participate in school sports such as basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, track. We have some students in our school who are very good in many sports but are not as good in school, so they don't have very good grades. Many of us at our school think that students should have at least a 70% or above to play sports , because if you have it at a B grade average not very m any students will be playing sports because not that many students are able to keep there grades up.

Students love to play sports it keeps them entertained and out of trouble out side of school grounds, but not very many students who are very well at sports are not able to play because they can not keep their grade average up to a B average. Although many think that it is good for a student to have a B average in all their classes others disagree. Others disagree because not everyone is the smartest and doesn't do the greatest in their classes, so they are not able to play any sports, and therefore they get themselves in to trouble.

For the past years at SCHOOL_NAME has done very well in education but in sports we were not the greatest and know that we have to have a 76% or above we have gotten way better because of they fact that students that are very well in sports are able to keep their grades up to a 76% and are able to play sports. know we don't just have good education but we also have good sports and actually place in the tournaments that we have.

As you can see we are better off having the sports grades up to a 76% because not only do we have good education we also have good sports.
