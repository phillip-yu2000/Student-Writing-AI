This artical shows that Dr. Huang could maybe idntify human emotions on an computer, but they would have to scan your face to prove exactly what you might be feeling. They use Leonardo da Vincie's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa -- as an example; when they do this they say that she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. But, How could a computer read your emoitions? Could we really ues this in a classroom to help identify students emotions lke they did in Leonardo da

Vincie's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa --. In the aritcal it says that this computer could see if a student is confused or bored. Dr. Huang predicts "That it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.", but if this computer is doing all of this then would there be a need for schools or teachers. This new tecnology is making as though this emotion reading computer could be placed in you're home and then you're children could just learn there. THe reason i say this is because if it can tell when a student is bored or confused then what would happen if the other students are getting it then it changes just so one student could understand it. Would that confuse the other students, or would it help everyone in the long run? Maybe they do have a good idea and maybe it really could help., but I also this it could hurt as well. It could put school teachers out of a jod. this computer could making it to were there is no need for schools because this computer could be instaled into your house and your childeren could just learn at home. Along with them learning at home this computer could tell them other ways to understand the work by reading their facsal expretions and emotions.
