Have you ever thought the ''Face'' was made by aliens? The ''Face'' Is not made by Aliens. The ''Face'' Is A Natural Landform. On May 24,2001-twenty-five years ago something weird happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was snapping pictures of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted something that looked like a face.

An enormous head seem to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Scientists thought it was just another Martian mesa,common around Cydonia. In paragraph two it states,'Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh'.The ''Face on Mars''has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film,appeared in books,magazines,radio talk shows ,and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!

In paragraph five it states,"Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide,say conspiracy theorists". Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5,1998,Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) team snapped like 10 pictures. In paragraph seven it states,"When the image first appeared on a JPL web site,revealing ...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all".
