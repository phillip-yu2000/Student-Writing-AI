Texting and Driving

Ten percent of injury crashes in 2011 were reported as being distraction-affected crashes. "In 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver, while in comparison to 3,267 in 2010". An additional 387,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes that involved a distracted driver, as opposed to 416,000 injuries in 2010. Texting and driving is not worth the risk of killing or injuring anyone.

Texting and driving is the most preventable type of car accident worldwide. If everyone will just put their phone up when they drive, they could prevent one more car crash. Another way to prevent texting and driving is to purchase then apply a drive cam, which records a driver's activity while in the car. Another way is to get the AT&T app called AT&T drive mode that disables the person's phone while driving so they're unable to text and drive. Most if not all texting and driving accidents can be prevented before they happen.

If your phone doesn't have any storage you can go to the AT&T website, itcanwait. com, and take the pledge not to text and drive. Itcanwait. com is one of many websites that gives facts and statistics to try to prove to teenagers around the world to put their phone down while driving. No text is worth someone else's life. Not only does this one mistake destroy the life that was taken caused by the mistake it destroys the life of that person's family.
