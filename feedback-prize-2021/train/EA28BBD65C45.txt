No robot has ever survived and no human has ever landed here. Its Venus. The Earths twin planet. a mission that plenty want to do but is too dngerous and risky for us right now. But scientists and NASA are working on getting to Venus, but why?

Like i said Venus is Earths twin. Venus, at some points, is the closest planet to earth. The only exception is Mars becasue all 3 travel around the sun at different times. Venus is our closest and most reliable planetary visit. Its conditions dozens of miles above the surface are rough, but liveable. With temperatures at that height at 170 degrees Fahrenheit, Venus is the closest things we can find to Earth. Meaning at one point Venus was probably just like earth with large oceans and mountains. If Venus was just like Earth back then, there is a chance that there was forms of life on this planet. This make scientist want to go and get sample of the gas and rocks on Venus and try to see if there was life on other planets except Earth.

With Venus surface 90 times hotter than earths 800 degrees, right now it almost seems impossible. Every robot theyve sent to land on Venus has not lasted 2 weeks. This dosent stop NASA from researching and still giving effort to land on Venus. One day, scietnists believe a Venus visit will be marked down in the books.
