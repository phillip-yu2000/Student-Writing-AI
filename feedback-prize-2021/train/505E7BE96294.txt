Dear Principal or whoever this may concern:

Many kids have cell phones these day, and you can't help the fact that they do. I agree that students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and other free times, as long as their phone are turned off during class time and other important times.

I feel this way because if kids are using them during free times and not during class they aren't hurting anything or anyone. It should be the student's choice to use it when they are not in class. I don't think teachers and other adult authorities have the right to tell us not to use our cell phones when we are not in class. Many kids may have to contact their parents for important issues, so using their cell phone when they aren't in class is a way to let kids communicate with their parents or guardians very easily, plus it is not effecting anyone when they do it.

Using cell phones during lunch and other free periods doesn't hurt anyone or anything. I strongly believe that until it starts to effect people, students should be allowed to use their cell phones in their free time at school.

More and more kids are starting to get cell phones and it's a fact. This is why I agree that students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as their phones are turned off during class time and other important events. Times are changing, it's 2011! Students should be allowed to bring their cell phones to school as long as it does not effect class and learning time.
