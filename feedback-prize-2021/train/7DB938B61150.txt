I believe it is wrong and i disagree with it. Here's why, the students should have their own rights and opinions on what they want to do, they shouldn't be forced to do an activity. A student could have a medical problem or they may not have the time to do the activity. Students should feel comfortable and feel like they have freedom. It could also lower morale at the school, because students could feel pressured or stressed.

An activity is not must, it is usually something thought about doing for maybe spare time. It is an invasion of freedom, In a way, to make students pick to either play a sport, work on a yearbook, or serve on the student council without their will and some type of benefit. It could also effect their parents/guardian, if students are made to play a sport, because the parents/guardian would most likely have to drop them off and pick them up from games or practices. It should depend on what the students want to do and what they can do, no one should ever be forced to do something if they don't want to do it.

I think they should allow students to do an activity and give them the choice to decide if they want to do it or not. It could make the school benefit, if they did that, because it would raise moral and it would make students feel comfortable and not stressed. The students would have way more energy and focus if they are abled to decide if they want to do an activity or not.

My conclusion is if you want students to feel comfortable and positive let them decide what they want to do with their lives. don't make them do an activity if they don't want to do that activity or if they don't want to do any activity at all. Students should have atleast some freedom at school and they should feel like they have control over their life. Let students decide what they want to do if you want the school morale to stay positive and the students to have good energy and focus.
