Being distracted while on the road, no matter what it is that you're doing can be highly dangerous to everyone involved.

Over 90 percent of crashes are the fault of drivers. The most frequent driver mistake is "recognition error," which encompasses driver's inattention, internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance." In other words, most crashes are not caused by flagrantly intoxicated people, nor that driver who will do whatever it takes to get to their destination one minute earlier. Most crashes are caused by people like you and me who think they can pay attention to the road and do something else at the same time. When you are engaged in conversation, be it on a call or texting or even with someone else in the car your attention is divided.

Texting while driving is a real life situation and more people are at risk by the minute. Of course some people may not care about the effects of them texting while driving but other people do. Being patient and waiting to send a text could save many lives. It starts with you. Take a stap and save lives.
