Technologies nowadays can recognize emotions. The software makes out the 44 main muscles on your face in order to identify what you are feeling. They base it off of the 6 basic emotions. Technology now is so innovative that now we may be able to use this in classrooms to tell whether or not to change a subject or not when a teacher is teaching.

So all of this begins when a computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 of the major muscles in your face. In the model all these muscles move like a actual humans. Dr. Paul Echman ,creator of the FACS, classified the face having 6 basic emotions- happiness ,surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness. Each thing is accosciated with its own characteristic movement. Each and every single person has the same universal emotions on there face, they are all universal. Dr. Huang said that " even tho individuals often show varying degrees of expression." The real question is tho is how this can help us when it comes to school and teachings in the classroom. What I mean by this is that teachers could know when the students are not finding interest in a subject of a disscussion anymore. This technology can scan the room and see what peoples emotions are during the subject and if they are not good then the teacher could try a different approach and if that worked then they would know that is what they need to try for the next class. Everyone learns a certain way and if you have a class that has a majority of people that learn a certain way then you know the sense of direction you need to teach based on this technology.

Now that we know that everyones emotions come off the same way and that everyones reactions to things are relativly close, don't you think that this would be good in a learning enviroment? Every person learns a certain way and if you know this then why dont we use this technology in classes so the teachers know that they need to change up teaching styles or just come back to something a different way.
