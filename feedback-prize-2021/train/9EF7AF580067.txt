I think that the "Face on Mars" is just a naturual landform. I think that it is unlogical to say that Aliens created that face. I'm going to give you a few reasons as to why I think that. What do you say?

Okay so, if the "Face on Mars" was really created by aliens, why would there be absolutley no evidence of the aliens creating it? How come it has only appeared in books and magazines? Im just curious. I do believe that the "Face on Mars" has always been there and is a naturual landform.

I know that this is just my opinion though. You all have the rights to your opinons as well. So, what do you guys think about the "Face on Mars"? I would love to hear your guys' opinion! Feel free to write the NASA scientist labratory to fill me in on what you think!
