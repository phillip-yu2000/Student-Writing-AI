Phones and driving

People should not use their phones while driving it is very dangerous. There are many risks when it comes to driving so we shouldn't make the risk higher by using our phones and getting distracted. This can cause you to wreck into someone or run off the road.

This can be a serious problem and people are doing this more frequently now and it has cost many people their life. If your using your phone while driving it gets you distracted and you can often not pay attention and do things you could've prevented if you weren't using your phone. A deer could run out in front of you at any time and if you were looking at your phone you would most likely hit it and that can lead to some serious damage to your car. To prevent from getting on your phone you can try things like turning your phone off when you get in the car so when someone calls you wouldn't answer.

Stop this from happening because people are loosing their lives due to a text from someone. A text is not more important than life rather its yours or someone elses.
