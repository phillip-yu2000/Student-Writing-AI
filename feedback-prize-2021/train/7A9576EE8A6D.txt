The Facial Action Coding System will not work, because it can only understand six basic emotions, when their are much more. It can only understand happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saness. It doesn't understand regret,passion, and hungar. It does not have sempathy, so it will be hard for the Facial Action Coding System to help the stundent with the promblem it detects. The Facial Action Coding System won't understand why the stundent will need to leave to use the restroom. And it won't understand why the stundent act out on emotion. Or what the emotion can make then do.

Yes the Facial Action Coding System can dect basic emotions by looking at the facial musles, but their are so many more emotion beyound that. The Facial action Coding System has no teaching ability. Nor does it under how teach and explain thing in a simple way. It does not know how to expain things to the younger stundents how don't understand things. The Facial Action Coding System is a fantasic idea, but it has a far way to go before it teaches any stundents.
