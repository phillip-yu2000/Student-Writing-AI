Dear, Dr. Generic_Name

I agree that students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity and heres why. I think that students should participate in a extracurricular activity because some students might not like the idea about doing a activity, However if they try it out maybe they will like it and will be interested about it. I also think that if some students try an activity such as sports, working on the yearbook, or serve on the student council, it will help them come out of there comfront zone.

First I agree on your decision because some students wouldn't like the idea about doing an activity for school, However if the students tries out an activity than maybe they will be interested in it and will carry on with it and make it a carrer in the future. Me as a student I want to play sports. Sports interest me and if I play sports I belive that it can take me a long way.

My last reason on why I agree about your decision is because certain students in our school are shy. Students that are shy can do certain activies that will help them come out of their comfront zone. I think it will help them get over their shyness.

So Dr. Generic_Name, the decision about making all students participate in at least one activity is a great idea. I relized that the activites I can do in school can help me take my carrer far as I can go. It also can help other students figure out what they want to do in the future. Shy students can come out their comfront zone by doing certain activites that will help them overcome their shyness. Dr Generic_Name this was a great decision you made.
