Dear, principal

I think kids should be allowed to bring them to school and use them during lunch and passing periods because if they have a problem in or outside of school they would have a cell phone to call 911 for example if their walking home and they see a fire they would be able to call 911. And if they would have some free time to text during lunch maybe they wouldn't text during class.

Incase of an emergency student could actually save some ones life for example there's two kids in the lunch room and one of them starts to choke and the other one could call 911. And after lunch period their cell phones would be off and the teachers wouldn't have to worry about kids texting in class.

There is a million reason why kids should have their cell phones at school i just can't name them all. this is why i think kids should bring and have their cell phones at school.
