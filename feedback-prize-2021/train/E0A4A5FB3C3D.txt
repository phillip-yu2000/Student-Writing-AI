Projects over summer break should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed so it provides a challenge, provides a glimpse of how the class will be taught, and if complications were to occur the certain individual can contact the teacher.

If students designed the summer projects they would make it easy for them to complete. The projects should require hard work and effort, as opposed to little effort if designed by a student. The project wouldnt be preposterous, just hard enough so that a challenge is provided.

Students can become accustomed to his or her teaching methods. Also, it helps parents know what to do if later on during the year the student is having complications. Scholars can better prepare themselves ahead of time if they're confused about the methods.

Teachers can easily contact the student. In addition to that, the student can also contact the teacher if they have further questions or problems. If this was student-designed it'll be hard for the professor to reach the particular student or group.

Over the summer, teachers believe that students will forget information that they just learned during the school year. So due to that matter, debates over if projects should be assigned during summer break are still controversial till this day. summer projects will make teens become more responsible and make them manage their time wisely. On the other hand, they'll come into school on top of that particular subject.
