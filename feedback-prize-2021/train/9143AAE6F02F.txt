I think that it would be a great idea limiting the usage of cars and what the advantages are beacuse when people have cars u hearing about crahes and all the other bad stuff. so a good way to revent al this from happening would be to get rid of car uasage and make people bike or walk to wherever they want to go to. Also limiting the usage of cars would prevent all the bad stuff from happening and help have a safer life and a longer one too.

In source it talks about how their are now cars in germany in the Suburbs. street parking, driveways and home garges are generally forbidden. In the new approach stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some istant highway. Heidrun Walter is a mother of two and use to have a car but sold to move to germany because alot of people alot of people dont have cars and she feels safre their because she knows that her children are going to be safe their. when she drove a car she felt all tense and freaked out. So in germany they tring ti create walking to stores or plaes that are like a block away because they feel like that is the best method.

The adavntages would be that u dont have to worry about getting all thses fines, getting your car impoud and not having to pay the fee. Also when u havea car u have to pay for the car insurance, the gas. Also it wouldnt create any cathos on the road and u would be much safre if the usage of cars went away because u wouldnt have to hear about car accidents that killed people. It would be a stress free world if cars went away. Also an advantage would be that u dnt have to worry about getting stuff stolen.

Ive explained to u that the limiting of cars would be a great idea because then u dont have to worry about all the bad things that could happen to the u if u had a car and u could walk somewhere or bike somewhere and that would be better than cras because it would be safer than a car.
