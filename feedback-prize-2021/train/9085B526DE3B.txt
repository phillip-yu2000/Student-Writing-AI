Dear TEACHER_NAME, I think that every student should have a c+ average because have that is easy for a lot of students but have to have a b average would be hard for a lot of people because many of us are passing by the skin of our teeth. I believe no they should not have to have a b average

My first reason why is if you hade to have a b+ average a lot of students could not reach that so there would not be many kids participating in the school activities so if there where not a lot the teams would be un even (A lot would not have a varsity, JV team) So it would be pointless for many schools to even have sports.

One of the reasons is the average should not be in general it should be where your talking about because if you talking about inner city kids that don't have a lot to get for them self's like school work so it would be harder for them to keep up with the other schools and if you talking about higher end schools yes the average should be a b+ because they have everything they need to pass school and if they don't then its there fault for behind lazy at school

My least but best reason is that the schools should be at a b+ average are proble the smaller schools because the ratio would be easier to have a b+ school when you only have 100 kids i go to SCHOOL_NAME and we have atleast

1000 kid's and it would be hard for the few people to try to keep the b+ average up.

So my TEACHER_NAME i hope you see why i say No for the b+ average to be able to in sports. Thanks for taken the time to look over my reason and see why i picked no.
