I disagree with the idea of driverless cars. They may seem like a good idea to some people but i say it is just more of a hazard. People now a days text and drive all the time and do not pay attention to yield signs or even the speed limit. Being in a car that you do not have to drive will give people the bad habit of not paying any attention to the road or things around them. With a car driving on its own they wont think it is neccessary. I say it is not a good idea at all to start such a bad habit.

Although people may think it is a good idea to have driverless cars on the roads, I disagree. They say that the car can steer itself and ecelerate and slow down but what about all of the other things. There are multiple different things a car must do on the road that technology can not take over. Such as getting onto a highway or passing another car. How would a car know how to move left the back over right or if a car was coming from another direction. Technology may be upgrading but i think that it is not smart enough yet to control a car and get a passenger safely to their destination.

Lastly, driving a car is a huge task and priveledge. Their are many different rules in driving such as no texting while driving and you must wear a seatbelt at all times. A driverless car is way too dangerous for teeneagers or even adults for that matter. I feel that being in a car that somehow drives itself will make people think that they have no responsibility anymore and they will think its okay to text and drive or not pay attention to their surroundings. Driverless cars were a good idea but i do not thing they would be safe for our generation.
