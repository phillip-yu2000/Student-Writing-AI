Dear Principal,

Not everyone has the ability to get a B average. If they try as hard as they can, and still don't get

B average they should still be able to play sports, and do other activities. Exercise is very important, it helps you do better in school, and it is fun to do. Other activities are also good because it boosts peoples confidence and they can make new friends. Grades are not the only important thing in this world.

Where the world is right now, obesity is taking over. It is mostly from fast food, but also a lack of sports, but if they eat fast food and play sports they wouldn't be obese. People shouldn't have to suffer from getting lower than a B average, since C is average. If someone has lower than a C average, they should have to suffer from not being able to play sports, or do any other activities. Then they would be able to work harder on there period of no sports or any other activities, and concentrate on there school work.

Some people just can't get good grades, like in the B average range, but they work as hard as they can to try to not to get lower than a B average. If they enjoy this one sport, or this one activity, i don't think they would enjoy not doing it, though it would make them work harder, so they can play again. Sports and other activities take up time, which students could be using that time to study or do homework, though they have time to do there homework or study either before and or after practice.

Parents should be the ones who decide when there kid should stop sports or other activities to get there grades up. The parents are the people who make decisions for there kids, and if they thought there grades were not so great, they can stop them from any sports or activities. It should not be up to the school to decide.

Signed,
