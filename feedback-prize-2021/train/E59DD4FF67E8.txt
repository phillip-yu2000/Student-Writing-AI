Having students take classes from home could work out very well, but also at the same time be very defective to the student, simple as becoming less motivated to do stuff as in sports and extra after school activities, I would love to take my classes from my home being that i wouldn't have to raise my hand for things, ask to go to the bathroom, or let along ask borrow something. I also feel that students would get in less trouble if they were to take classes from home, therefore theres less of a chance of students getting into fights with others and less of a chance of students showing up late to class. Being in the comfort of your home while working on class assignments is what most students would want instead of being cramped up at school with other students.

There are mostly flaws with this idea, consequently students wouldnt always be focused on what there really suppose to be doing, I wouldntÂ really understand or know how it would work or how it would process therefore i couldnt say that all students would even attend the class since there is no school to go to. I think a majority of the students would be lazy and like i said less motivated to get up and do stuff because school isnt just a place where you get your education its also a place where you learn how to become a young adult and being at home everyday taking online classes would not teach any of the skills of being a young adult.

In fact taking the online classes instead of going to school could be challenging for most because some students may not have the basic requirements to get on to the online course as in a computer/device and internet overall if it came down to having to take online classes or just go to school id rather take the online classes, speaking for my self i know that i have the requirements to take online classes others may disagree.

For the parents that are involved it would probably be a hassle for them as well and what i mean by that is they would have to be the ones to register you into your online classes and plus some parents may not trust there kids home alone while there at work, I cant say that all parents would have a problem with it in fact some parents might love it because it saves them the trip of having to come down to the school when something bad happens let along helps parents that take there kids to school, therefore it helps them on their time management. Overall having a online class for students would actually be very beneficial just cause of the less inconvenience of getting to school and finishing school.
