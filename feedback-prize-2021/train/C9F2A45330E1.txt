Dear principal, I think policy 1 because students have a lot of free time at home to get on their phones. I understand that teachers want students to keep their phones away in class because they are trying to teach us new things. Another reason is that if the student has a test he/she must put them away so they won't get distracted. That's why teachers want them to get on them if they are not in class or anytime when they get out of school. Many teachers say that phones can make the student feel like he/she don't care about their work but they do. I think phones are allowed because there might be an emergency that happened at school and they can't contact their parents.

If you would allow the students to bring cell phones in only for emergencies, there might not be as much disruption in class from the phone ringing. Some parents tell their children to bring them to school because you don't relay know what's going to happen. Probably because something at their school happened and the child can't call their parents. No one knows what might go down in a public area like the school.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
