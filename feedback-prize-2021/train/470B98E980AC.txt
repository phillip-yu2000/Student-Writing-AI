What I think about phone and driving is that it is dangerous it can cause an accident and kill someone. For example, what if someone crashes and kills one of your family member just because they were on their phones or you crash into someone because you were on your phone you would feel bad for the person you crash and the reason was for being on your phone you might end just getting arrested. This shows, that no matter whenever you are driving you should keep your eyes on the road something can easy cause a accident so fast. This is important because, now they have made a new aw about if a police sees you with a phone on your hand while driving you will get ticket or get arrested just to prevent an accident. Clearly this is why its important to not use your phone while driving.
