Dear Principal,

I think that you should consider Policy 2 because I have experienced many people using their phones during class secretly without the teacher or the person monitoring them approve of it. Also, phones distract students, and can lead to lower grades in school. In fact, my parents do not allow me to bring any phone to school, and they will neither purchase a phone for me or allow me to buy a phone till I can be independent and earn my own living.

Another problem is that many students are dishonest. Texting on a phone is another way people can be dishonest and exchange answers from another. I have seen many people throughout my life that cheat on a test or plagiarize another person's work. Most of my friends procrastinate and ask me for my homework so they can "compare answers" and to avoid failing a certain subject. Some copy off my answers during a test, and some, a very few amount of people, copy my name on their test. Soon after grading the tests, the teacher then asks why I have multiple tests, and then assumes that the cheater(s) miserably failed the test. Phones make it harder for me to not fall into peer pressure to give my homework to my friends, and texting is increasing the chances of dishonesty in this school during tests, quizzes, etc. In conclusion, integrity, honesty, and character in students can be improved by making sure cell phones are not on campus or school property, and can improve a numerous amount of students academic experience.

Sincerely,
