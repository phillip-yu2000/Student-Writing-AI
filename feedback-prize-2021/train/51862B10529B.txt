The idea of changing the school policy is not fair, since many students work hard everyday just to pass, some students work so hard that the most they get is a C average. some students may have a grade lower than C. then when they start to get involved with sports and other activities and they like it, it then makes a huge difference in their school work. After the students finds out the have to have a certain grade for that particular sport they try and do better. For many of the students they love and enjoy sports and other activities and when it comes to grades the feel like a grade of C is the best that they can do. If u change the policy they will start to fall behind in school and that C will start going to a D then maybe even a F. many of the students grades start to go up when the do sports and many other activities since many of the sports wont let you play unless you have a average of C possibly a B and if it turns out that is what it is going to happen then they would try harder and their grades go up. If a person participates in different things like after school sports or something that keeps many students out of trouble. When students participate in sports the get more active a bit more. and they go on healthy and stronger. stronger now because sports help a person learn their strengths and weaknesses. If you still decide to change the school policy still i just want to say that's going to be a big mistake. it will be a mistake now because students will stop trying and won't get higher grades or be healthy.
