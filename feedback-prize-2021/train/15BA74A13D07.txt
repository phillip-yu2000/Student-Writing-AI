Driverless cars wouldn't be able to sense where pedestrians, any animal, or buildings that are in area. Without there being a driver available, the world would be horrific. For the basic measures of not being able to control the seeing of environment. As well as the driverless car being able to move on its own.

There would be accidents contineousely. In paragraph 7 it states the model in 2013 BMV,

notifies the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, naviation through work zones and so forth.. What if the buttons you were accessed to sensor the car stopped working in the progress of you being on the road? What if the system got corrupted, and begin to not function with those features described?

It would be putting your enviorment in danger, as well as yourself.

In conclusion, driverless cars shouldn't be a factor anywhere. Due to minors, systems being corrupted, or the simple fact that it's no one to blame for damages or deaths it could lead. The government, or the president would have deal with each matter if the cars became a law. Who has that much time on their hands? Is the invention really worth putting yourself and surroundings in harms way?
