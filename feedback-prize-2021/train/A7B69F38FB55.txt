This article states that venus should still be studied further despite all of the danger that it brings toward the people and the equipment used to do so. The author supports this giving evidence and ideas. The author talks about the things that we have tried to do in the past that have failed and the ideas that we and NASA have for the future.

In part 2 the author states, "Each previous mission was unnamed, and for a good reason, since no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours." Then the author goes on to talk about the new ideas and advances they have made such as, NASA came up with an idea of peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet.

In conclusion I think that the author supported this claim very well. The way that they talked about in the article it made it very clear that they knew exactly what they were talking about.
