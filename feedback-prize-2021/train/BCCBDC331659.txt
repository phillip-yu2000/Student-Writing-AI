I favour the election change to popular vote because the electoral college is not reliable.

In the second source,

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong,

paragraph ten states "voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president." the whole point of an election is for the voter to vote for who they want not vote for someone who might not even stay true to their word.

Paragraph ten of the second sourse aslo states "Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office.", "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always." How can voters vote for someone who they don't even know? How can voters trust them not to betray them? This system has not been set up to benifit us, it basically makes us give power to the electors and hope for the best. This seems like a shot in the dark.

Paragraph sixteen in the third source says "each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)" yes it says it rarely happens but there is still a possibility that it will happen, it's inevitible.

Be skeptical. Question everything. then and only then will you find the truth.    Â
