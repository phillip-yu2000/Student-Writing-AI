Dear, principle

I think that student's should do community service because it help those that need help like old people and our community when they clean up trash and recycling it can also be fun like making games out of it like for example trash hokey were they use trash as the buck and trash cans as the goal. So I say that students should have to do community service even if does take time it can still be fun. I think the school should have a week that sponsor's community service and all the stuff people do to help our community they should get a day to play games that involve community service like trash hokey and other games like that because our community is great and we should keep it that way for along time to come and it doesn't have to be picking up litter it could be tutoring elementary school children during the after noon or helping the old do stuff like go outside and enjoy the fresh are and the sunshine that's the important stuff and the helpful stuff that we should all do every now and then.

sincerely one of your students, STUDENT_NAME
