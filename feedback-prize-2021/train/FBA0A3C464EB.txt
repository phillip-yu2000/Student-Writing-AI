There have only been a few spacecrafts sent to Venus but none of them lasted long scientist are trying to figure out how to get a spacecraft to hover over the surface. The reason is to collect samples from there and then be able to make it back or have enough time to send the information the spacecraft got, back to NASA.

For example " Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcaneos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface". We are having trouble getting the data back because the spacecraft it is getting destroyed.

It may be very expensive to attempt to get to Venus but it could give us some good insight on what we can research and study back at Earth. The stuff we find on Venus could be benefical to us going to different planets and exploring different parts of the Solar System.

In conclusion we shouldn't let money be a factor on if we get a spacecraft to Venus we just have to figure out how to safely get there and be able to gather the data from the spacecraft. If we do find something we will most likely go back and try to find more of it or more helpful resources.
