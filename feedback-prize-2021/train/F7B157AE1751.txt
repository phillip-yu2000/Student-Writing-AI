dear principle,

i think you should go with policy 1 is you would reconcider the cell phone policy in our school. i think you should use this one because 8 periods a day for for 6 hours a day all we do is learn and have a little break is lunch but in between periods there are lets say 5 minutes to travel to class to class and hense that your not learning so that make it our free time and our free time is,our free time witch should be watever we want to do that is not dangeruos or breaking school rules. so letting us use our phone would be a great idea to keep the bad kids from doing somthing stupid or so friends can cumunicate with each other if they dont see each other through out the whole day so i think policy number 1 is a good choice for the school and they students in the school and instead of turning your phone off during class i think isnt realy a good idea because we have kids that with just think that the teacher wont notice or look im cool because my phone is on. soo to get rid of that problem i would have each teacher have a bag or a box and when each students comes in the door they would have to put there phone in the box and if they got cought on them during class i would make the teacher take it away and they wouldnt see it for the rest of the day. and another idea for the cell phone policy is that all cell phone should be on vibrate or the sound should be off so you dont have all ringtones or beeping sounds goring throught the hall way when other students are trying to cumunicate by talking. so like i said you should go with policy 1 but change it up just a little bit just like i said to do with the sound off and with the teachers putting all the cell phone in a box before class and get them after class and if got caught take it away and the student wouldnt see it untill the end of the day.
