The Electoral College has changed between what it is and what it does. The electoral college is a organization that pick people to become president. The electoral college consists of 538 people that are allowed to choose the president and have there rights. Out of the 538 electors, 270 elcetors are required to vote. Each person that runs for president in your state has their own group of electors and they all come together with one answer.

They are chosen by the candidates in the political party and after that they are given their responsibilities. When that's over, the governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment and send them to the congress and national archives for the offical record of the presidental election. The electoral college is wrong in many ways. Regular voters vote for the presidents but they are also voting for the high standard elector groups with around 34 electors in it.

Being asked to change the electoral college, my respons would be yes becuase it is unfair to us and to the winner take all system in each state. The electoral college is outdated, and irrational.

If voters came together and had meetings about how they feel towards choosing presidents it would be alot easier because some people vote just to vote, but others actually care and want their votes to be seen. They are better known as the most thoughtful voters, on average and thats how they will/can receive the most information and attention for the candidates and they should be the ones to decide the elections. Their votes are strong and may actually help the parties have better agreements on who they would pick for president.
