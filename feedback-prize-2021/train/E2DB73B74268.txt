Dear Principal,

The student body is very upset with the change in the grading policy they just don't like the idea that if they don't having a B or higher in every class that they won't be able to participate in after school activities such as sports or student council. I understand what the school is trying to do by making students try to achieve a higher standard in grades, but this punishment for not having excellence in the grade books is totally out of line. For Example, some students my try their absolute hardest in the class but yet they don't make the best grades and you want to take away their spot on football team or spot on the student council for making an effort in school. I would like you to put yourself in our schools and see if this is unfair or not. Some of the students only way to express yourself is through the after school activities and you want to take that away from them because they didn't do well in English or another class. I work my best in school and see that a lot of the kids here do the same, but I ask you to consider maybe have the grade policy lower so that more people can have a chance to work and play in after school activities. I just ask on behalf of the student body to reconsider the grading policy to be lower so more kids have a chance to play sports or have fun in after school activities.

Sincerely yours,
