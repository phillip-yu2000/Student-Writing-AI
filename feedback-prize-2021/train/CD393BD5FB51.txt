Driverless cars have good and bad things that would go along with them. From my perspective though I believe that we could go without them. Cars that can drive themselves not only puts the one driving in danger but anyone around the car. Having driverless cars just makes us lazy,if we can not drive a car. Driverless cars should not be something we should invest our money into.

Cars that can drive themselves is a very dangerous and scary idea. A big machince that is operating itselve around others that are doing the exact thing is not a good idea. Very many mechanical mishaps could happen easily to cause the car to do things it wasnt made to do. If an animal or a person would happen to jump in the street would the car be able to detect that and stop the car before something very bad was to happen?

Having driverless cars puts a bad message on us. Having driverless cars would mean we dont want to drive or are too tried to drive or just to lazy. I think that this would make the United states look bad if we were to happen to get driverless cars.

Driverless cars may save us money individualy but over all as a coutry I think we could lose money. Driverless cars have so many sensors and devices that would need to be installed and would have to be manufactured which causes a lot of money. "These smart road systems worked suprisingly well,but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical." This was stated to show that these sensors and things that are needed to manufacture these cars are more expensive than they should be. This is why I think driverless cars are a bad idea.
