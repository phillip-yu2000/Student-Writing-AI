This is not valuable to have in a classroom with students , it could casue problems with each other depending on how someone feels about what one another is talking about. This is also not valuable because what if the computer messes up and read a persons emotions the wrong way , you can always put a fake smile on your face just like when it says while looking in the mirror to raise the corners of your mouth , thats fake smiling. This also seems very personal , what if you didnt want somebody knowing how your feeling you didnt want to tell anybody then somebody brings a computer towards your attention just so it can read you . It says to an expert that faces dont lie , that is certianly not true i've seen so many faces lie just like on t. v how they say they put on a fake smile making everybody think that there just oh so happy but in reality there really hurting .This would also kind of do good in a classroom to help out confused kids when there to shy to ask for help , but this also could be bad because if the computer just throws the kid on the spot it would make the kid even more shy or nervous then what they already are. So no i dont think this is valuable in the classroom but then again it could help out alot.
