Students having the option to do extracurricular activities is beneficial, though having forced to do so does more harm than good. First it reduces the time for students to interact with their family members. Second students will lose time to sleep from doing their extracurricular activities. Third student's schedules are now shorten thanks to their mandatory elective. The next few paragraphs will explain these reasons.

Most students have families, so by forcing extracurricular activities on them, they will be unable to do certain things. They won't have enough time to spent dinner with their brothers and sisters. A second reason is that they can't play with each other. Plus those parents have jobs which already shortens the time they have with their kids. Now last these student's aren't able to take care of their siblings.

Sleep is a thing that most living things need. Having to work on the yearbook or doing soccer takes energy. Now by being forced to do so is just insulting them. Just doing school is enough work for students and by adding on to it, is making time to rest shorter and shorter. With little rest students will put less effort to learn and quickly fail.

Having a schedule is useful for organizing a bunch of tasks and by completing them with efficiency. When doing extracurricular activities, their schedules are even more shorter. Some schools are 8 hours long to attend, by adding on it could mean 10 to 11 hours even closer to half a day. Students would have about 3 to 4 hours to do something that doesn't involve sleeping. It would really make their schedule more critical than before.

To summarize having students forced to do extracurricular activities is harmful to them. Students will have less time to be with their family. Their time to rest is shorten which will make students suffer overall. Schedules are now more crammed than before. In conclusion schools shouldn't force students to do activities, It creates or worsen problems.
