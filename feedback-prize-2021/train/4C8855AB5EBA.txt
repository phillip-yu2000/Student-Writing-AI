Have you evr wanted to help take care of animals on a boat, or even go see places that you have never seen before? Well then, you should come join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Thia will allow you take care of animals travel to different places, and trust me I have been on there it is very fun. If you are not persuaded enough let me give you 4 reasons why you should join.

The UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hired ¨Seagoing Cowboys¨ to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. Now imagine that, while the animals were over seas the probably got hurt. Wouldn´t you want to help them I know I would. There were night watchmen, his job was to check on all the animals every hour. That sound like alot of work but it´s not.

Here is another reason, besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. I bet you haven´t seen Europe or China. Wouldn´t you like to see there lifestyle there clothes and all the other stuff they have. Probably learn a new language. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. It really was special all of ther colors were beautiful.

My last reason is, after we unloaded the animals we had alot of fun. We played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Now that is fun, all the time you were takig the animals back you had to keep an eye on them, but when they were unloaded you would have alot of fun.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up the world to me. I´m grateful for the opportunity, it mad me aware of people of other countries and their needs. This is why I think you should come and join Seagoing Cowboy program, trust me you will have fun.
