The Seagoing Cowboys program is an amazing opportunity. You get to help people in need, and you get the added bonus of having fun and sightseeing on the trip. If you are looking for work, this would be an amazing job that will change your life forever. You will need to put in hard work and dedication, but this job is worth it all.

Another reason to be a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will be doing a good service. You will be helping countries and the people inhabiting them. For example, "To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals..." This is a valid reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys. Not a lot of people get the chance to help an entire nation by bringing them cattle, mules, horses, and food. If you are worried that you will not get any free time, don't be. You get to sightsee whenever you land in port and experience very amazing places and things such as the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. An excerpt from the article "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves" would be "Besides helping people, you have the side benefit of seeing Europe and China." Another benefit of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that it opens your eyes to needs in certain poor countries, or countries devastated by disaster. In addition to that, you have to put in a lot of hard work and dedication to feed and take care of the animals onboard the boat. But "Being a Seagoing Cowboy is the opportunity of a lifetime."

That is why you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboy program. It is completely worth it and you will come back from this amazing experience more aware of what needs to be done to help people in other countries. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity that you will treasure for the rest of your life.
