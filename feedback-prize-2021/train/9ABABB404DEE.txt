Our current voting system seems completely unfair and odd. Why should what the majority of the people want have to go through an electoral college first, we leave it to them to decide what people want. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of electors where they vote fot the president and vice president. It also includes the counting of electoral votes by congress.

To begin with, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required for a president to be elected. The number of electors in each state equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation. One for each member in the House of Representatives and plus two for the senators. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

Next,Â  the electors can be anyone not holding oublic office. The disaster factor is the main reason why people don't like this system. The 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislators are responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy what the people want. There have been many disasters in the history of the elections having to do with the Electoral College.

Also, the worst thing that could happen is if there was a tie. If there was the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives.
