Dear principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I want you to consider policy one for various reasons. The first reason why we should have cell phones is because some parents like to check up on there son's and that can't happen in policy two, but in policy one we can do that and if you are a parent wouldn't you like to check up on your son or daughter? Second, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to bring them at all because say we forgot our homework at home and say we already missed a day of homework and if we miss another one we will get a detention, we can just call our mom during lunch break or passing period and tell her if she can bring our home work. Lastly, say we are in a lock down because someone had a gun in the campus and the man or women cuts the power off so no one can call through the telephones we can just grab our cell phones and call the police. I'm not asking you to approve it I'm asking to considerate please.
