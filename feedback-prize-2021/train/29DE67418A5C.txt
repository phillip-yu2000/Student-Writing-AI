Driverless cars have been imagined and desired for years. But now we are getting good enough technology to actually realize the dream of driverless cars. The subject of driverless cars, like all things, has pros and cons. But when it comes to driving vehicles, safety should be the first concern.

The article mentions many of the new safety features of driverless cars. Some of these are the sensors that keep the car from hitting objects. Another safety feature is the GM seats that vibrate when the driver is about to back into something. There are many others as well, and these safety features prove that we are close to getting safe, and fully functioning driverless cars.

However, there are some concerns about safety in driverless cars.

Many are concerned that the cars will not be able to respond to certain circumstances, like weaving through traffic, getting through an accident, or sliding on ice. There have even been cases of automatic breaking features breaking to quickly. What this means is that sometimes, cars with automattic breaking will break to quickly for the driver behind them to respond. This causes the driver behind to rear end the car with the automattic breaks.

Personally, I don't think we should use driverless cars, due to safety risk. It is just to soon, and the technology isn't quite good enough yet. However, our technology is improving all the time, and at some point in the near future, it just might be good enough. But untill that time comes, I believe that driverless cars should not be used.
