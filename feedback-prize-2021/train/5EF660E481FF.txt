Do you ask more than one person for advice? When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person because people have different things to say, people want to find the best advice, and find who listens the best.

People have different things to say. People have different opinions. The person can sort the options out in their head, and can make the decision faster. Another thing is others ideas. Others ideas could help situations and tell you what is best. If multiple people share options, you will have more to chose from. Having more options makes you feel better so you have a wider range of options to chose from.

Next, you want to find the best advice. Find a trustworthy person. Someone wont belittle you for your decisions or judge you. Listen to people and what what they have to say. You have to realize that unsolicited advice does not always mean bad advice.

Lastly, who listens the best. you can tell who really cares. If they are trying to help you instead of just doing nothing, it shows. You can tell if they are fully present and in the moment to help you. Most people would keep eye contact with you. Eye contact shows that they have your full attention. Listeners will encourage you to keep talking and will give you feedback.

Overall, I feel like when people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person because, there are different things to say, people want to find the best advice, and want people who listen the best.Â
