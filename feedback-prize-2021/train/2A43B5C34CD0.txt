The schools activities are decided on if the students are doing the right behaviors or goals. The students actions can reflect on if they need community services. On the other hand if the students volunteer to do community service than they should let the staff decide if they deserve it or not if not, than the students or staff should just find something else to do. The staff decides to agree to the students requests, but they should organize in advance if not than the activity will be a bad experience.

The students would probably not like to do something like that again. Also the staff would be less ecstatic about trips these are some down sides. If the trip or service is a success than the company might want the school to come back in the future. The students would be glad that they get to get out of school for a while. The staff would be glad for the kids not getting on their nerves all day.

All activities be would fun for a group of students would enjoy the experience of a trip. The staff I don't know about, but they might as well. When the activities are complete the students will know something new, and the staff probably knew the subject already. I think students should be able to go on the activities to learn or do something knew.

When some students go on trips they might not pay attention, but there glad that they got to get out of classes they don't enjoy.
