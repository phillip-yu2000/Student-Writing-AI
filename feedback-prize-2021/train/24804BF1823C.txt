Other students might think it lame or rather do other stuff. but i would take the position because i think its a great for our community and for our city. But really it depends who you are and where you come from. Other might want to do it and other might not. it all depends what kind of people you chose. i would do it because its good for our city and good for the people that around us.

Hears a good idea what kind of people you don't want to chose gang bangers and cholo's they would go but only for the wrong reason. they would go to mess around or to disturb others. the people you should chose is respectfully, kindness people they know why there coming for to help the community out.

i have a lot of friends that will join to help out and i have others that wont. it all depend who you choosing. and it depends where you getting them from. i would like t do it for a short of time. but then i would stop and go do my own things.....
