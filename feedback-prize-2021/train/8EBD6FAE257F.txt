The Seagoing Cowboys is an amazing program waiting to happen. I'm Luke and at first, I was unsure about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy, but now I'm sure I've made the right choice!

Many don't truely know what the Seagoing Cowboys is. During World War II, many animals were sick and had a scarce supply of food in Europe. The UNRRA decided that the needed a special position for horses and cows. That is the Seagoing Cowboys.

Some people may wonder about the experience and commitment of the Seagoing Cowboys. It is an outstanding experience for anyone! I get the daily benifit of seeing sights in Europe and China like the Acropolis in Greece. I've also rode a gondola in Venice, Italy! What else is on your bucket list? In addition, I've toured an excavated castle in Crete and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China!

Any sea lover or animal lover should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It took a few weeks to travel on the Atlantic Ocean from the east coast to get to China. I attended to the animals and feed them in the ships.

Many people think that being a Seagoing Cowboy is no fun, all work. You are wrong! We play activites like baseball and volleyball in empty areas. We always enjoy the competative nature of table-tennis, fencing, and boxing when we are off work. Any readers would love to join, as many Seagoing Cowboys love the places a story can take you. Games are a jolly part of any off day with the team. Also, the experience is even more exciting when you bring a friend. Sure, all of the Seagoing Cowboys are your family, but a friend makes the family even closer.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is one of the most rewarding things that has ever happened to me. I believe anyone should be a Seagoing Cowboy if they want. This experience made me get a better grasp on what other countries (and not to metion the animals) need. I hope that ou will be a Seagoing Cowboy because, it is "hays" (days) full of fun!
