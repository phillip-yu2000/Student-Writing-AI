I will be sharing three reasons with you why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

For one, if you are an animal lover you get a chance to help the animals on the cattle boat. As it says in the text, "On his second trip, Luke seved as a night watchman. His job was to check on all the animals every hour."

The second reason is that even though you are serving around the world you still get to go sight seeing. In paragraph five it says, " Luke also toured an exavated castle in Crete and maveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China."

The third reason is that you get to be of sevice around the world to help countries after World War II. In the story it says, "To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, forty-four nations joined together to form UNRRA (The United Stations Relief and Rehabilitation Administation)."

So in conclusion why you should join the Seagoing Cowbows program is because you can have fun and be of sevice at the same time.
