I think Policy 1 is better because if we had our phones at break and lunch if an emergency happened i could inform someone. Also, if we could use our phones in our free time we would be distracted from fights with means no crowd to hover over the fight. I do believe we should be able to use cell phones but only at break or any free time. Say if a student didn't feel good instead of going to the nurse we could just simply ask our parents to pick us up to save time.

I wouldn't recommend Policy 2 because what if there is an emergency at school, or if you walk home you wouldn't be able to contact anyone. I think it's a horrible if you cant bring your cell phones to school, you never know when your going to need it. In this case i hope you realize Policy 1 is much better. I hope you look over this response carefully and choose the right policy which is obviously Policy 1.

Sincerely,
