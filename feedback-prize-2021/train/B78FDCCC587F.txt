Being a Seagoing Cowboy was one of the best times of Luke's life. He got to travel the world and explore. And he got to help people around the world.

Paragraph 3 tells us about how in August 1945, Luke received orders to go to New Orleans. He arrived Agust 14, 1945. There Luke got my seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for Greece. On the ship were a 335 horse cargo with hay and oats to feed them. In paragraph 4 we learn that Luke turned 18 before he made it to Greece. This meant he was able to be drafted for military service, but his draft board said that he should just keep the service he already had. Luke was discharged in 1947, but he had made nine trips by that time, the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Not only did Luke help people, but he also got to see Europe and China. Paragraph 5 tells us how Luke got to see the Acropolis in Greece and how he take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a lot more than an advemture for Luke. In paragraph 9 he quotes, "I'm grateful for the opportunity," he says. "It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs."
