To whom this may concern,

I am writing a letter arguing against requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. I think that kids should only have to maintain a C average to participate in sports or other activities. I am fighting against this because for some kids i know it may be hard to maintain a B average. I also know that the kids with a C average would still like to participate in the activities and sports. Most kids work very hard to maintain their C average because that is a passing grade. Like I said before it may be hard for some children to get a B average even if they work hard and try their best. I think that it is not fair for the children that try their best to keep their grades up and still not be able to participate. Having to maintain a B average to play sports or participate in any activity is hard on a lot of children because if they do not reach that goal it may have them thinking they are not smart enough. This is why i strongly disagree with the fact of having to have a B average to participate in sports and other activities.

Sincerely,
