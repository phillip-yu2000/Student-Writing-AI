Have you ever wandered about self-driving cars? I believe that they should be the next step in the automobile industry. Some reasons why self-driving cars should be part of the future is because of the traffic jam assistance, in car entertainment, and the safety of the self-driving vehicle. How does a car assist you in a traffic jam?

In the self-driving cars vehicle manufactors have built it to be able to drive in conditions below 25mph. When a person is in a traffic jam they begin to get bored and eventually sleepy. Instead of a person now continuisly have to push and release the gas the car now does that for you. Also when the car is driving the person is required to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times. This feature also alows the car to react if the driver falls asleep. Wouldent in-car entertainment just be another distraction to the driver?

Most people would say that having something else to watch while behind the wheel is a distraction to driving. For this in-car entertainment the feature would only be avalible for the driver when the car is in traffic jam assist mode and would instantly shut off when the driver needs to take over the car. How is all these gagets safe for the driver and all other drivers?

The safety of these self-driving cars has been checked over and over. More and more sensors are being put into the car to make it able to detect other cars and to stop/go when needed. Although one arguement about safety has been brought up about not having a human driver controlling the car at all times.
