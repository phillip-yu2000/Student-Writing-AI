As a student, I believe that our principle is right to change the school's policy. If she would change the requirement to a B average it would motivate those students who really want to participate in sports or other activities to get their grade higher. This is a give and take situation and right now all the students do is take and take, but don't give it their all. You have to give your hard work to get something you want in return. You give them at least a B average and you get to take sports. Changing this policy will help out the students. They might not recognize the kindness of you changing the school policy, but for now you just have find a way to get what you need out of the students since they aren't going to do it themselves. I mean we need education way more than we need sports or other activities. What we learn here, we use in everyday life and the students are blowing their chances at a successful life. This is a good plan. I can absolutely feel it. This plan will be more successful than just giving a speech about importance and how we, the students, need to keep our grades up. It's not a active way to solve this problem. By giving a speech you're still leaving it up to the students and you can tell that leaving it up to the students doesn't give off a good result. By changing the policy you're actually doing something about it. This way it'll get through to the students much clearly than a speech that'll probably make the whole student body fall asleep. Changing the school policy will bring on motivation, change, and then a better future for us students.
