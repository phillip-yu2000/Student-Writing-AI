I believe that more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. There are many reasons to do so and claims too. Some may not agree, but they should know that joining this can be very helpful to people around the world.

One reason people should join is because they get to see the world over. You can look at many different landmarks different while helping people at same time. I know that if you join this program you have many responsibilities, but you will have time to look around at least see the sights. Luke Bomberger, a man who joined the

Seagoing Cowboys, was able to go see many Europe and China such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water, an excavated castle in Crete, and Panama Canal on his way to China.

Another reason why you should join is because you'll usually never be bored. There will always be something to do on the ship. Going back to Luke Bomberger, he stated that he fun on ship after animals were unloaded. They played baseball and volleyball in empty holds were animals used to be. They also did table-tenis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games as well.

Final reason to reason to join is you'll be helping many people who are in need. If don't know already, many people in different countries don't the items need for survival, and they need them desprately. As a Seagoing Cowboy you'll be providing them many animals that can give them those items.

In conclusion,more people should join the Seagoing Cowboys. You'll be able to travel around the world, you'll be able to find fun, and help people in need. Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy will be a good choice in your life.
