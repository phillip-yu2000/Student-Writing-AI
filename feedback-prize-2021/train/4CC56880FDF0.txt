Asking for Advice

Sometimes when asking for advice, it is hard to know exactly who you can go to depending on the situation. Not everyone has been through the same thing that you're going through, so some people wouldn't know what advice to give you. That's why it is a better idea to talk to multiple people about your problems or situations.

Many different people have many different experiences. Some may know more than others, and some may be wiser than others. You can get more advice by talking to multiple people. They could give you different and better ways to handle the situation. Not everyone is going to have the same opinion of course, but that's up to you to figure out and decide which way you think is better to help your situation.

Talking to multiple people about your problems not only gives you more advice, but it makes you feel so much better! I know when i'm upset, talking to someone about it makes me feel a lot better. I know some people have trouble opening up to others. A lot of people have trust issues and don't know how to talk about there problems, but getting things off of your chest relieves so much stress. It's healthier for yourself to talk to people about how you feel and not keeping everything trapped inside of your head.

There are many different people that you can go to for advice. Talking to people who are older and wiser than you are is probably the better way to go. People you could talk to could be a close family member, a trusted teacher, your school councilor or any of your friends may be helpful too. At least one of them is going to know how you feel and how to help you. You're not alone and you have people to talk to. You might not know them very well, but that doesn't mean they can't still help you.
