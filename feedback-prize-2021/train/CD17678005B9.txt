The idea of having driverless cars is quite the phenomonon. Not having to touch the wheel of brake or even look out the windows of the car. This is all very possible in the next ten years or so. The problem that lies within this idea is, how safe will the cars truely be? you can only trust techonology so much before it will fail on you and people could die. I think it is a geat idea if we could get them to be where there would be no wrecks or accidents involving them.

These cars copuld be a major blessing or a dreadful curse to humans. A lot of humans already hate driving in the first place, would they even listen to the car telling them that they need to take over the wheel. It all seems like such a lot of time and money to do so. The world is working perfectly fine without driverless cars. Nothing is more trustworthy than the human hand itself. Creating new laws to accompany the liability of the wrecks and all the lawsuits that would be filed if someone were to be injured or even killed in a wreck involving a driverless car. A lot of manufactureres woiuld be going out of business because of the fines that would be put on them. Its not as small a deal as forgetting a screw that could cause damage, you could end someones life becasue of one tiny mistake.

It is a good idea and all but the amount of work that would have to be put in is immense. The lives that would be lost or the people that could be hurt is not worth the luxury of being driven by your own car. Some people disagreee, they will most likely change their mind when they realize how catastrophic driverless cars really are. Besides, right now, the so called "driverless cars" still need a driver in many situations becasue of difficult road conditions that the car cannot evaluate quick enough to maneuver around. All in all, driving isn not too terrible w-to where we would need to risk someone elses life because we did not want to drive. Driving is fine and I am sure people can deal with that.
