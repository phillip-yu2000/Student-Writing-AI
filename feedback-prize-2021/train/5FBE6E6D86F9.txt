Dear Principle,

I believe that you should decide upon putting in place the first policy for multiple reasons. The first reason why i believe you should decide upon the first policy is because sometimes students need to call home to their parents for various reasons. For example, perhaps a student is not feeling to well and they really want to just go home so that they can rest and take care of themselves, however the nurse examines the student and decides that because what ever they have is not contagious they should stay in school. Then the student may not be able to concentrate and learn properly plus they would feel miserable and that just isn't pleasant. However if the student was able to call home during the day then he/she would be able to go home and take care of themselves. I can probably guess that one of your concerns with the first policy is that students will take the new allowance too far and not only text during lunch and free periods but also during class time. This would be a valid concern, but students already text during class and they get in trouble for it; so i believe that it would be no different than it is now in terms of students texting in class. Another valid concern that you may have about the first policy is that there may be cyber bullying since the students would be able to text in school free times; and also since their have been many teen suicides recently due to cyber bullying. This too would not be too much of an issue because if there is any cyber bullying going on than it could be punishable. Over all, I truly believe that you should really consider the first policy as the new policy.

Sincerely,

A Student
