Dear Principal,

Cell phones should be able to be used at breaks and lunch periods. This is true because they aren't hurting anyone, they allow kids to call or text their parents if they needed something, and they allow lonely people to play games on their phones if their friends weren't around. In the following paragraphs I will show you why cell phones should be aloud at breaks and lunches.

They aren't hurting anyone.

They are just communicating devices. As long as it is only used at breaks It's not like we are in a class and a cell phone goes off and then the whole class is distracted from learning.

They also allow kids to contact their parents if needed. Me and my friends take a trolley home sometimes, but i don't always get to take it because someone is already at school to pick me up. If i could use my phone at a break though I would be able to call my mom and ask her if i could take the trolley before she would have left. Or, what if a kid accidentally left a project or paper at home and it was due the next period. All he would have to do is call his mom or someone at home to come to the school and drop it off. As you can see, cell phones allow kids to contact their parents in times of need.

They allow kids that are alone to have something to do. Some times kid's friends might be absent and they might have no one to talk to. If they could use their phones they might be able to play games on their phone Another thing they could do is call friends or family members at other schools. So then they wont be so bored and they will have something to do. This is how cell phones allow lonely kids to be occupied.

In conclusion, cell phones are a useful tool and should be allowed at lunches and breaks. This is because they don't hurt anyone, they allow kids to contact their parents if needed
