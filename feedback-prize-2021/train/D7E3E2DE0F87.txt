I am with the people who are for using tecnology to read students emotional expressions. I am sure that this tecnolgy will help out everyone in different ways.

If teachers are not able to tell what is going on with a studant it make a teacher just get mad but the proplem with that is that thaey dont't know what that kid is going thought. In many different ways people are not all the same and some times school empolyees don't understand that. This technology works in many=y diffrent ways but it starts off when the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face. The movement in one or more muscle is called an "action unit"

In paragrah 6 the auother gives example's for what this technology could be in a classroom In the this paragrah it siad " A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" and this examople really shows how teachers can really benifit from have technology to help and tell what a student is felling and when they do teachers can try to help out and not just be mad at student for being confused. A student can really benifit from this as well,If a student feels confused there not going to want to make it seem that why. They will just keep flowing along and make it seem that they understand everything and when it comes to test time they will just fail and it's easy to understand that they don't want to seem like fools in frot of the class,but if we had the technology that we really asked for teachers will just know that a student will need help and stop the class to help the students a littel more.

Overall we need technology to help some student that have proplems learing in a school inverment and be able to puch them to new limits. Just thick about this technology will change the way we learn in school's ang just make everything much more easy thanks to a man called Thomas Huang who mad this type of technology.
