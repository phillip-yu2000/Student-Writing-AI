In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author is stating that he thinks people should study Venus. The author stated many reasons on why he thought they should study Venus no matter what the dangers or conditons are on the planet. I think it would be good to explore and study Venus because it was stated to be very similar to how Earth is now.

The author stated Venus is offten referred to as Earth's "twin", and that it is sometimes one of the closest planets to Earth besides Mars. Venus is also called the "Evening Star", because sometime you can see it from Earth. The tempatures on Earth and Venus are very differant, although the author thinks that at one point, Venus could of had living people, oceans, and could of been very close to how Earth is now. Venus still has features that make it similar to Earth.

Venus now has a differant atmosphere. The atsmosphere is thicker and 97 percent carbon dioxide. NASA has tried to study Venus in the past, but no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA has not tried to take any kind of space craft to Venus for more than 3 decades. On Venus, the surface averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The conditions are for more extreme. Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any other planet.

NASA eventually wants to send people to Venus, although they would not be able to touch the surface. They would float about 30 miles above the surface, similar to a jet airplane. Although through pictures they would not be able to know how the surface is, I think they still need to study Venus.

The author wrote this passage expaining many reasons on why scientist and NASA should explore Venus. Although there is many dangers to exploring Venus I think it is important to study a close planet that could have possibly been like Earth now.
