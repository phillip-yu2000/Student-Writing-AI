dear principle i think students shouldn't do community service because it takes time away from things they have to do like school work or after school activities its not a bad idea but my opinion is that you shouldn't have students doing community service for example if theres a student that don't have good grades and needs to catch up having to do community service wouldn't help at all and the student wouldn't have time to catch up. another example is that students like to do after school activities like play sports and do other things and if every student was required ton do community service there wouldn't be time for after school activities or time to catch up on homework or missing work. but we can also benefit from it because then our school would always be clean and helping younger students with there work is also a good idea because that makes the older students feel good about helping younger students and putting a good example so when they get to middle school they will make good choices and have good grades. but my final decision is no every student should not be required to do community service.
