I am against the self driving car because it can crash and it would be you fault. And it isn't even a self driving car because the driver still has to pur their hands on the wheel most of the time. It can't drive itself the driver has to keep their hands on the wheel almost all of the time.

If you get in an accident and someone is injured it is your fault. The car won't even be made until 2020. The car will only drive itself 90 percent of the time. Some states won't even allow them to make self driving cars because they are to dangerous. Like Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. The only safe car is one with a human behind the wheel.

Drivers would get bored just sitting there. The car can only go 25mph without a human's assisstance. Human drivers have to stay more alert than ever with the car. None of the cars they make will ever be completely driverless.

The cars have to alert you before they back up into something. Nobody wants a driverless car that you have to drive.
