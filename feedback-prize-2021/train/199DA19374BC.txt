I think having self driven cars are going to be dangeres becasue there is alot of problems with cars that you have to drive yourself. Why are they trying to make a car that drives by thereself? It would be cool but its to risk.

Its to risky to have a car drive by its self. Because what if you fall in hard sleep and you get to a work zone. Your going to get in a wreck. Thats putting other people in danger.

What if the sensors mess up and just stops working. BOOM wreck right there.

Theres also good reasons for the driveless car. You can play on your phone because you dont have to watch the road. There would be less wrecks because there is alot of wrecks becuase people are playing on there phone and trying to drive at the same time Or you can do you make-up when you are running late to work or a meeting. You also can save gas. If you save gas more money you have.

If you going on a road trip and you tired just take alittle nap. But they need to put a loud alarm in the car so when you need to drive you will be able to get up and drive when you need to. There would be less people falling asleep behind the wheel and getting in to wrecks.

My conclusion is that the driveless car is both helpful but dangeres at the same time. But I think there spend to much money on them when they could be working on the cars you have tyo drive yourself because those dont work properly either. There always a problem with them so what makes them think that the driveless car will work better?
