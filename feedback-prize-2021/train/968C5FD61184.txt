I honestly think that Policy 1 is a more reasonable choice than Policy 2. Policy 1 gives students the freedom to have their phones on school grounds and use them, but not the distraction of using them in class. In my opinion, Policy 1 is a better choice. Not being able to bring phones to school would mean students may not be able to contact Parents, Guardians, or other family members that they need to contact.

A student may need a way to get home but without having his/her phone they would have no way to contact someone to pick them up. Also, Policy 1 gives students socializing time without being late to class. Teachers wouldn't have to take up phones and distract the rest of the class because a student was using their phone. Students would have the opportunity to talk to people that they can't meet up with in the hallways, or after school.

I think teachers and students would benefit from Policy 1. If you chose Policy 2 i honestly think that students would bring them anyway and use them during class, causing them to not pay attention and make bad grades. If you enforced Policy 1 most students wouldn't be using them in class, for they can use them in free time and during lunch. Having the opportunity to use them in free time would make students more motivated to finish their work, and get things done.

There's a chance that students would fail because of them using their phones in class, and not paying attention to what's being taught. I honestly would enjoy being able to use my phone during lunch and free periods in the day. Others would enjoy it also. Most students would be against Policy 2.
