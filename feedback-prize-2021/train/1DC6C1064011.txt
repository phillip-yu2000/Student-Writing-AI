i think that is not far to change the school policy with out talking to us about and i think that instead of a b average they should have a c plus average instead because they have a better time making it and doing the sport they want to do. they are getting pushed so hard that some cant make the b average to play. its going to be hard for them to make the limit for the class also its not far that none of them talk it over with the students to see if that is far or reasonable for them to consider to change but them did not.

if the students want to change the policy and the principal want to still change it will also help them ok with there grades to improve them so they got a better grade and could also play any sport that they want to play. some people might not think its far because they can not make that grade to play sports or to hard to work all of that in to get a b average.
