Phones and Driving

Many people use their phones while they are driving. Almost 390,000 injuries occur each month due to distracted drivers. People should not be allowed to text and drive! Because it puts others in physical danger. We can stop this from happening by having the laws against phones more heavily enforced and discourage cell phone usage by producing a Bluetooth software to use hands-free across every device.

Furthermore, individuals who disobey the law and keep using their device on the road should have to pay a fine for putting other drivers in danger. If the problem is still occurring after the fine, they should get to face jail time or pay the fine with an added $100. The final step in stopping phone users behind the wheel is that they should lose their license for a year. Hopefully, this will be an efficient way to stop distracted drivers from losing their focus on the road by using their devices.

Also, phone companies should be directed to add safe driving features to help keep the public safe, which will in turn bring down the death rates from people using their phones and driving. Companies should encourage safe driving by making a system that makes answering calls and replying to text messages with your voice to minimize the loss of concentration due to the loss of focus on the road. It would be beneficial to make hands-free devices mandatory before they go to the market.

All in all, stopping phone usage on the road is beneficial. Creating hands-free phones by all phone companies should be a safety demand required by the law. The number of offenses on the new law should be up to 5 offenses each month. When you are in trouble for using your phone while driving by the law with an offense, you should loose your drivers license for up to a month along with additional taxes to teach you a lesson. If these actions are carried out properly, up to 421,000 road incidents related to distracted drivers could be prevented each year.
