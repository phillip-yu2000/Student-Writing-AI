Did you know that one of our students got 1000 dollars cash price because our principal put him in one of our school activity ! Our principal told us that we should participate in at least one of our school activity. First I did not like it. Then I thought of one kid that went to my school and got a 1000 dollars just because he was good at his activity. So I agree with this decision because students can get to know each other, students can a college degree, and it helps them learn new things.

This activity can get students and new students to know each other. They can find there new best friend in there.

New students can get out of there shy sell and can make new friends there. Even old students can make new friends there too. Probably the whole class room can become friends !

Kids can get to know each other more better if there in a school activity.

If a student is good or great at there activity. They can also get a big college degree in it. Like Art or sports. there art work can go in a Art Show or in sports you can go in a big show ! Maybe you can get a college degree in any activity. Also can get money and a college degree.

Students can learn new things in there school activity. Students don't know yet what and what not there good at yet. So students need to try out for these activates so they can know. Student can explore too. They still have time to try out new things and to find out what there good at. They might be good at drawing and they just don't know it yet. Probably your good at drawing too. Theses school activities can help you and your future out.

Students can get to know each other more, students can get a collage degree, and students can learn new things. Students can get better in school with this and there future can be made with this too. I think this is going to be a good plan for students and kids.
