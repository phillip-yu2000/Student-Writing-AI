well i think we should all help the community. so i say yes to assign community service because i going to tell you my three main ideas why we should .first reason is because we should all help out the community second is because it will show we care about are community and finally we should feel good we help everybody around us.

my first reason is we should all help out the community because we don't want be living in a community that is dry and there's tagging all over the wall it doesn't look right .how are people want move in if we got are community looking like a trash can. or you rather be living in a nice community where there's parks around us and the grass is green and all are houses are nice taking care of. well i rather live in a nice community.

when young people start to make a different about there community it make the community much better. even if one person gets a bag and goes around start cleaning the community each the community looks nice clean and care for. it only takes one person to do that and after that a hole group of people could paint old house and community will just feel better look better even smell better.

finally when you ever helps someone else from your heart don't my feel better about yourself. well you should because helping a community its like helping your self and everybody around you too. who wouldn't like helping other because you should feel happy .its a get feeling when you help some they really persisted your do in that.

as you can see those are my three main ideas why you should give every body community service because we should help the community out ,to show we care about are community and last because it feel nice to do something for others why we should have community service.
