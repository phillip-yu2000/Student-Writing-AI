Dear Principal,

I think that Policy # 1 is good because the cell phones won't disrupt other classmates during class because the cell phones will be off.

I like the idea of being able to use our cell phones during lunch and other free time, it still lets us do our work when we need to do it.

I don't think that Policy # 2 is good because students bring their phones to school anyway most of the time, so if they are finished with their work I suppose they should be able to use their cell phones whenever they have the time.

Lunch time is a time when students get together to eat their lunch and socialize.

They aren't doing any work at that time so they could use their phones if they wanted to.

Cell phones wouldn't disturb anybody if they were used at the right times, like it states in Policy # 1, lunch time or free time.

Having no cell phones at all could be harsh because if there is an emergency you would maybe need to use your phone at that particular time.

So in conclusion I think that we should be able to use our cell phones during school only during lunch and other free times but we would have our phones off during classes.

But if students violate the rule of cell phones being off during class, I think that they should get a warning about doing that so they won't do it again.

So that is what I think about the 2 polices about cell phones in school.

I agree with Policy # 1.
