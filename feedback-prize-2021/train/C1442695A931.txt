I think asking multiple people for advice is a good thing. Because if you are really stuck on something you are are going throught and really need help. Or you just simply need some advice asking people is good. You can different people for help and they most likely have different opinions than you but thats okay. And based on their opinions those opinions can help you on your next decision. But if you need help for anything always ask to talk to someone you trust and an adult. Because if you stay quiet it'll end up hurting you more.

Asking for help is always a great thing to do. Because it can help you relief stress. And also talking to someone can help you feel better with what you are going though. It can also help you with your next decision that you are stuck on. It can always calm you down and you won't have to worry about it as much and you'll also be more relaxed because you talked to someone about it.

Also if you are afraid to talk to somone it's normal for someone to be afraid. But never hold it in for too long because it hurt you more each and every day. And thats not a good thing because you'll not be as happy as before you'll be more stressed. You would be worried all the time and thats too much for someone to handle with. And it's okay to be uncomfortable to talk to someone but you'll feel much better after to talked to someone about your struggles and your worries.

In conclusion it's always good to let everything out. And to talk to someone about what you are going through because it'll make you happier and a better person. You won't have to deal with the pain. And you'll have more energy and you won't be sad and you'll feel way much better about yourself. At the end of the day always talk to someone never hold it in.
