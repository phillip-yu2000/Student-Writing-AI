There are many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. If you read the passege, Luke says his life was changed and he had new exsperences. Many the exsperences were seeing wonders and cities he visted. Some of things he visted are Venice, Panama Canal, and Greece.

Luke says there were many things to do on abourd the ship. Sections 6, 7, and 8 tell you the things he did abourd the ship. Some of the things were baseball and volleyball games. Then there were boring things he did on board. He had to get water for the horses and feed them. He also had to be a nightwatch men.

I would aggre with Luke, that joining the Seagoing Cowboys is not a bad idea. He says that it changed his life and he got great things out of it. Section 9 says, that because he did the program his decendents loved to help people and poor countrys.
