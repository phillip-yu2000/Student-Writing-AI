I will explain the advantages of limiting car usage. I hope you enjoy this essay.

Limiting car usuage definitely has its advantages. You can for one, limit pollution in the air. Less cars on the roads, = less gas to go into the air. Less gas in the air, = better breathing for citizens. We all could use some better air for breathing.

Some people prefer walking besides cars because of the dangers of getting hit.

Kids could be walking in the street, not paying attention to anything but themselves, and get hit. That can't happen if their city limits car usage! Limiting car usage saves lives! You could walk more safely, without having to worry if the driver is stupid and going to hit you!

Another reason limiting car usuage is good is, Drunk Drivers. If you limit car usage, Drunk Drivers are limited as well, decreasing accidents, deaths, etc. We all know that less Drunk Drivers = a safe community. No one wants to be a victim of a drunk driver accident.

To conclude, these are my reasons for why I think limiting car usuage is good. It decreases pollution, decreases accidents with kids getting hit, and limits deaths from drunk drivng. Thank you for reading this essay.
