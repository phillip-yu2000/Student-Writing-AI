There are many advantages to not driving or not owning a car at all. Though i have a vehicle and do drive it the world could be a much better place if people did not use their cars so much. In this passage i will be telling you some advantages of not driving so often. So lets get started.

The first advantage i am gong to talk about has to do with pollution. The exhaust from our vehicles is terrible for the atmosphere and creates smog. one major occurance of pollution from cars afecting the atmosphere occured in Paris where tehy had to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air. There have been many other cases of this same thing being caused by cars so too much driving can and will harm the atmosphere.

Another advantage to not driving so often is that it saves money. Not driving so often saves money in many ways one being that you dont have to pay for gas as often. Also if you never buy a car in the first place you will not have a car payment every month or an insurance payment. So save yourself some money and stop driving everywhere.

The last advantage of not driving so often that i am going to tell you about is that you will not be as stressed. Driving can put alot of stress on a person one way of doing so is road rage. Road rage can be causd by many things such as people driving to slow or not paying attenion to other drivers around them. Some people also get stressed when they are drivin somewhere they have never been before.

So all together driving less often can help stop pollution, save you money, and cause you less stress. Driving to much is a bad thing for us and the environment. So when possible walk, ride a bike, or carpool to get where you need to go.
