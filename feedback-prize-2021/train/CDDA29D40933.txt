Dear , TEACHER_NAME

We believe that not all kids should not have to perform community service .This is unfair to us because , we feel that children should not have to use there fun time on doing community service each and every day . We understand that helping the community is really important but , some times kids need to have there fun and do important stuff on there own time .We had a group discussion with a hand full of seventh and eighth grade girls and boys about community service . A lot of the kids kept asking why do they have to do community service and if they were getting paid for it . We all explained to them that community service will not always be fun and you do need to get paid for helping your community , it's just something that people in your community needs help with . We also discussed having kids who behave and get good grades to get to pick and choose witch days that they want to do community service and if they want to compete against other people to get money for doing there jobs . We choose to have 4 different groups to go into a challenge of doing the best community service . Witch ever group that wins the challenge will get 150 dollars each for doing the best community service for the school year , and would also get a plate in city hall with our pictures and our achievements that we have accomplished from doing hard work in our community .We really do hope that you wont make everyone do community service , and if you do i hope that we would be able to have fun with it .
