Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that all students need to do something that helps the community. Whether it is picking up trash or helping other in their work. If all the students do a community service, the community will be cleaner and better. There would be little or no trash on the streets. People could help other people with work.

It might take up some time, but it will help the community. Some work doesn't take very long either. If you decide on picking up trash it will only take twenty minutes. If you tutor a student it will only take one hour. Community service is not a waste of time. It will help a lot of people.

If we would not have community service, the streets could be filled with garbage. There could be students that don't get help in their homework. That could cause them to get out of school and not want to learn. Those kids could turn out having a bad life.

There are no reasons to oppose on community service. bad things could happen without it. So I think that every student needs to perform a community service. It will help the community and the students. It will also help the people living in the community. Things will be better in the community.
