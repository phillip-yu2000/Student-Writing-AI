Exploring a new planet could be as hard as exploring any planets. Planets have many differences from things we're used to on earth.

In the passage "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author suggest studying venus is a worthy pursuit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is a very close planet to us and is known as the "sister planet" which, means it is close and could be an alternative if something happens to earth. In the passage the author explains how we could adapt if people were to go there "systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces." The author also states "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus." Not only mechanical parts and machines, alot of things could be made for people to be able to adapt to Venus.

In conclusion exploring Venus would not be a bad move for NASA because of the possibilities of what could be there and what we could do to adapt there if we had to. Theres alot of things we could do for it to be ok for people to be there and could be an alternative planet.
