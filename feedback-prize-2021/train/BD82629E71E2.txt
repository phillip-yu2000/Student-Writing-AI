If some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. By a way of online or video conferencing the student would benefit.

The first reason is the student can focus because in school there are many distraction. For example you got students taking while the teacher is taking and that takes time away from the students learning. Also the student might not get their work done because he or she was taking to someone which can lead to horrible grades and a awkward relationship with the teacher. But if the student were to do online school there are less distractions and with less distractions the student can get their work done witch can lead to excellent grades.

The second reason is students can be themselves because in school if you don't fit in the student is an outcast. Therefor can lead to depression and suicidal thought also if students dont keep up with the latest trends they are made fun of. Because they dont have $200 dollar shoes or designer cloths but if a student was homed schooled they wont have try to impress someone or a groups of people. The student can just be themselves and they wont be made fun of their cloths because they are homed schooled.

The last reason is bullying most schools have some type of bullying. Student that get bulled are more focused on the bully then school witch can lead to bad grades, depression, and suicide. Also students don't want to go to school because of bullying and students don't look for help because they are scared of what people might say. Therefor if a student was homed schooled they wont worry about bullying.

Also people might say that the student needs to go to school to make friends. Those people are wrong because there are many ways to make friends like joining a sport team or making online friends. Therefor online school is more beneficial then going to school.
