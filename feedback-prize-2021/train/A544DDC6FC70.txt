The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think the Facial Action Coding System technology that allows computers to read emotions could be valuable to students in a classroom.

One of the ways this technology could be valuable is because it would help students who are confused or bored, like Dr. Huang predicts,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored." That would be valuable because students are sometimes afraid to ask for help so the computer could either inform the teacher or provide extra information to the student that needs it.

Another way that technology in a classroom could be valueable to students is because it could give teachers feedback on how their students are liking the assignment. If the students become bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicted, "Then it could modify the assignment, like an effective human instructor." So that would give the teacher feedback of how their students are liking the assignment. Then they could modify the assignment to be more enjoyable or less confusing for the students if needed.

The Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions could be valuable to a classroom for many reasons. It could help students that are confused on an assignment by reading the student's face to see if they are confused. It could also give teachers feedback on how their students are enjoying the assignment. If the students aren't enjoying the assigment or are confused the computers could inform the teacher. The teacher then could modify the assignment to make it less confusing and more enjoyable for the students. Those are some of the reasons why that type of technology could be valuable to students in a classroom.
