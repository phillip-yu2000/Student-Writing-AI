Dear TEACHER_NAME

I

think what you are doing is not fair. Students that get at least a C should be eligible to play sports.

Most kids in the school get a C

and that is a passing grade. You were to change the policy most kids would be upset. Some of them try their best and they get a C.

I think that kids in the school are doing fine with their grades and everything should stay the way it is. I know a kid who tries his best on every test and just gets by his classes. If the policy was changed lots of kids would not participate in sports and that would bring the whole school down. Sports and other activities are some reasons why kids try on there school work. So i think i speak for everyone in this school when i say it would be a bad decision to change that policy.
