To: Mr. Senator:

I belive that we need to change the electoral college to just the popular vote. I'ts not a very good way to do an election. So I'm writng this letter to you so that your can talk about it with your fellow senators. It would be much obliged if you would do that.

One of the reasons why we shoouldn't have the electoral college is that it is not fair to smalller states. Just the state of California has more than almost all of the midwestern part of the United States. If we had our election with the popular vote then it would not be bias like the electoral college is.

Another reason why the electoral college is the right method for our election is that it is not fair our voters. Like republicans in california there is no point in voting because democrats are the majority of the state. If it was just the popular vote there vote would actually matter. We need to stop think about the state and start thinking about the people in the state.

I would be satisfied if you would take this topic to your fellow senators and discuss it with them. It's not all about the rich people that live in California that get tthe big vote, it's also about the people who work all day and barley get any pay in Alaska. We need to thin about everyone in the U.S, not just the people in the big states.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME
