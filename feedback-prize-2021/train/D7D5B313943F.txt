Dear Principal,

I think community service is a good way too keep kids out of trouble. For example if a student that was supposed to do community service went with his/her friends instead.

And later got caught for stealing something from a local store and got arrested by the police. That student could have gone to the community service and get a chance to stay out of trouble and at the same time, help the community. Another example is, these student's that are doing community service will have no problem working in the future. My final example on why students should do community service is, so in the future you can say that you did something for your community and your community will remember what you did and not because you had to do it , but because you wanted to do it ,and that makes you a better person no matter what.
