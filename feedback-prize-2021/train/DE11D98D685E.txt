Helping the community is very essential to having a good, healthy environment. Doing community service is a good way to participate in making this happen. Some of my friends already do this good deed, but others think it is a waste of their time. Our principal is deciding whether or not to require all students to do community service. I personally would encourage everyone to do community service even if it is simply to help tutor some of your piers after school in a subject they are having trouble on, or even go around cleaning up waste on the ground. Community service only takes out some of your day to do a good thing for the sake of you and your community. In taking part of this service, you will be able to help out your community and also get what you need to get done too.

If all of us participate in doing some type of community service, there will be a great change for the good of our community. All students should be required to take some part of this good cause for many reasons.

One reason is because it is a good reputation for the school and city, and the other reason is because our community will be twice as clean, healthy, and happy as it was before. In conclusion, I feel that it would be best if everyone would participate in community service.
