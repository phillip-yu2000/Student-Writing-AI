Dear Principle,

I am against the new rule you have requested us athletes to have in order to join a sport. I write you to let you know our frustration over the reason that you say we have to have a B average to play a sport. I am playing soccer right now and I have a C average in the future I hope to play softball but with your new rule I don't believe it will happen. I encourage you to take away your new rule a lot of people don't like it for the fact that most athletes have a C average. If you are persuaded to have this rule you wont have much athletes playing for our school. For that reason we won't be able to win the championship for soccer.

You are probably expecting us to raise our grade in the subject in which we have a C, but most of the people can't get a B average, but I hope you understand that this rule shouldn't be applied to our school for the many reasons I have stated. A lot of your athletes are frustrated over this new rule.

Sincerely,

your student
