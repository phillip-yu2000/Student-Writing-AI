Im Luke Bomberger and I want to convince you to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Have you ever thought about exploring the world?

Do you like helping people?

Well what im about to tell you will make you to sign up right now.

Before I started I had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank.

Without my friend Don Reist i would have never found out about the Seagoing Cowboys.

He invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

I didn't say no I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

It was 1945, World War II was over in Europe and many nations were destroyed.

To help these countries recover their food supplies, anaimals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilition Administration).

UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Don and I signed up.

In August 1945, we received orders to report to New Orleans.

We arrived August 14, the day the Pacific war ended.

we boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster and headed to Greece.

I was 18 when we headed for Greece.

It took us about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China.

During that time we had enough time to go sightseeing at a lot of places.

But on the ship you do have to take care of the animals.

And what I loved most about being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you got to explore the world and help people who need it.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more then an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me Im grateful for the opportunity.

It made me aware of people of other countries and their needs.

I hope you join the Seagoing Cowboys because overal you get to explore the world while helping people.
