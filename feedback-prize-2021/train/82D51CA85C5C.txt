When seeking for advice, consulting multiple people for their opinion is important. That way you can get different perspectives followed by what they think. Getting advice from one person isn't bad, but getting multiple people's opinions is better. By doing this you have a more wide variety of opinions from different type of people, rather than just one.

At the end you could sum up all of your responses up and kind of "average" them out. Most likely the type of opinion that more people had to say about, would be one of your greater considerations. Say 4 people had sort of the same idea of opinions and only one person had more of an "off topic" opinion, compared to the others. You would most likely take into consideration the opinion that most people said. You could use some of the other people's opinions to back your own opinion up. So yes, when looking for advice, consulting multiple people is good so that you have more opinions to take into consideration and back your opionion up.
