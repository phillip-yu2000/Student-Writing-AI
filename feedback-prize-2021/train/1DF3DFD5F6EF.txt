I am against driverless cars because they could cause confusion and delay. They can also be one of the most dangerous things that man kind has made. The safety of the cars are a problem.

First, there are people in the world that are smart and can hack into almost anything. What if someone hacked you car and was able to control where you car goes? Either they are out to kill you or just mess with you. Hackers like that could have you car crash into something to either kill you or to target somthing else. They could have your car plung straight into a body of water. But there are the hackers that can mess with you. They can keep you car from turning on or even mess with where you want the car to drive to. What if terrorists got a hold of our car systems? I dont think the world needs anymore wars.

Next, what if its not he hackers but the car itself? The car can simply have something wrong with it. The car could probibly have somehting wrong with its technology, and It could malfunction and either kill you or just not work any more. when you are driving and your car suddenly stops driving in the middle of a highway, what would you do?

Lastly, " who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? You were the one that was driving it you could of done something to the car. But then again, the car company could of made a mistake in the technology resulting in your accident. Each side of the conflict would think that it wasnt there fault, and it could go back and forth in court.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea in the future. All they cause is confusion, danger, and delay. Driverless cars are just another cayotic thing the world has to deal with if it started to become a bother.
