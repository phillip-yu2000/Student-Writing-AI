Dear TEACHER_NAME,

There is no 'community service'

without 'community.' Think about that. Sure there's more to the community than just our school, but doesn't every little bit count?

There really are more important things to do than just sit around watching TV all day. What about all those children? Not the ones with all the new clothes, or the ones with the huge allowance. I mean the ones with nothing. The ones in which the only meal they eat is at school because a classmate offers them a little something. Those are the ones that need OUR help. They're not just in Haiti or Africa. They're right here in this very town, some even in this school.

Community service is simple. It can just be organizing a canned food drive and having each kid bring a little something in. We don't need to go all out. They say a little goes a long way. We all put in a little bit and before you know, we'll have enough to feed a nation. Or maybe just the kids in our town, but still, you get my point.

Community service should be necessary. There's nothing wrong with it.

You give a little time, get a little joy. It's a win win situation for everyone. Let's go out there and do something.

Lending a hand is all it takes. Just help the other students to understand that. We don't have to go and build a whole school in Africa, we just need to do SOMETHING. That something could simply be picking up litter or maybe helping a neighbor with some yard work. We just need to get involved.

All I ask that you think this over with an open mind. Sure kids have homework that they say they need to get done, but they don't do it either way. Let's get them off their couches and into the community. Maybe a field trip to see first hand what goes on? That could give the kids a wake up call. Just put yourself in the shoes of the needy. How would you feel? Alone? Helpless? Maybe like no one cares? Well I know I care. Let's get everyone else on our page.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
