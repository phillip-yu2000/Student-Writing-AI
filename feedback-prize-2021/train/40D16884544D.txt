The most accurate way to read another ones feelings is by doing it yourself, because technology is not the most accurate way to read or feel what somone else is thinking or feeling about. Feelings can not be calculated by using technology all the time, therefore technology will never be a good way to read someones feelings or emotions. If technology is being used like it is today then there will be a point in time where humans a ruled by technology.

Technology is a good use for many things but allowing technology to read our emotions and minds is not a good source of use. If we allow technology to grow and develope by observing human behavior then isn't it possible that technology can eventually become smarter than the human mind and be able to manipulate the human kind? If this were to happen then humans can be replaced in many job fields.

In the article it states (" Technology can read human facial expressions, if so then there would be a lot of revealed information about how many people feel about science, math,reading,history, and even their own job").
