Why phones should be banned

In a technologically advanced world like the one we currently live in it is easy for us to get caught up in our cell phones. Text, email, and social media link together all of your friends and family in one handheld device. With all these things we can do at the touch of a button it can be hard to put the phone down, especially while driving. What most drivers don't know is that cell phones contribute to a high percentage of deaths and car accidents in teen and adult drivers.

First, based on a survey conducted by the cdc "Each day in the united states approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver." This is an amazing statistic, out of the millions of people living in our country, thousands are getting killed and injured by simply looking at a text. Such a little task and it cost them their life.

Next, in a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the average driver is distracted by a text for 5 seconds, at 55 miles per hour you can travel the length of a football field. Imagine the amount of stuff that could happen in the length of a football field. Deer, pedestrians, sharp turns, you name it, and if you are distracted by a cell phone you could end up hurt, or worse dead.

So is that text message really that important? Can't it wait until the next stop? If you feel the need to check your phone i will tell you that waiting is the better option. If you check it right away you could end up as just another statistic and victim of distracted driving.
