Dear Principal,

I am a student here at our school who thinks that all students should not be required to do community service. I believe people should be the ones deciding if they want to help out in the community or not. Some people enjoy helping out and might want to take a part of community service. Others might have other activities to attend to like sports or church groups. Many might be busy working or having to do homework.

People shouldn't be forced to do something they don't have time to do. I think we have to take care of our priorities first then if time lets us, help out. There is many people out there to glad to help out others, but that might be people who have time to help, or enjoy doing it. Helping out others is important but so its helping out your self first. It would be nice to help out our community and have it clean, but things take time sooner or later little by little I am sure we will help our community. Even if not all of us have the time to help out with community service all at once I am sure there is few other people out there who will be glad to help out our community.

Hopefully this will help you understand why not all of us should have it mandatory to have to do community service. I am sure everyone would be glad to participate but priorities come first and not all of our students have that much time in there hands to be able to complete all there tasks they're made to do.

Sincerely,

An eight grade student.
