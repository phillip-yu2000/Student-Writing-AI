Dear Senator,

I think the Electoral College works very well and it is very organized. As stated in the passage "What Is The Electoral College?" it states that the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. This compromise is very important because it was created by the founding fathers. It should remain at it's place and it shouldn't change to popular vote elections.

Popular votes can most likely end up in a tie and it turns into a crisis. The Electoral College can also become a tie, but it normally does not happen. Also popular votes are not used an it is not organized nor established. The Electoral College was created by important people. The Electoral College is a slate of electors those are what the people are voting for. I think this is good because the electors are proffesional trusted people. Those people will know what candidate is better for the people.

Mr. Senator I think keeping the Electoral College is good it is better for the people. It is well organized and it was compromised fairly and it was established by the founding fathers. Popular votes may bring us crisis and we will have to organize the new way of elctions.
