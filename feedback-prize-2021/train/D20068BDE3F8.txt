If a principle were to make all kids participate in at least one extracurricular activity, what would kids and parents think? It could quite possibly go either way, a hit or a miss.

Most of the kids that go to school are antisocial, and what most extracurricular activities are about is communicating, for example, running a play in football, calling for the ball in basketball, talking to other kids in the student council. And that's most definitely not fair to the kids who are not very sociable. Besides, you also have to try out for sports, so if you happened to not make the team, your stuck with something you don't like.

Although some students may not be sociable, this rule could open some new doors for them, finding a new passion, or something they do in a extracurricular activities might just be their job when they get older.

Parents may also get very involved as well, everybody knows that if a parent sees their child unhappy, they'll do everything in there power to stop or put and end to it. And I personally don't think that schools want a swarm of angry parents trying to change some tiny rule.

Because no matter where you go, visit, or travel everybody's different! The world is a very diverse and unique place, full of humans with all sorts of different opinions and views. So you shouldn't force rules that make people unhappy. extracurricular activities should be a fun, option you can choose, not something you must follow.
