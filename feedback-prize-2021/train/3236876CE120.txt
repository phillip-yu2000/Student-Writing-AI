Should the Facial Action Coding System be used in a classroom environment? Would being able to tell a students emotions help with giving them the lesson? I think it would for a few different reasons.

I think the Facial Action Coding System should be used inside and outside the classroom. It would help the teachers know what is going on inside the students heads. In which then they could give the lesson in a way that the students could feel better about their work. This also would help the teachers know what may be happening in he students lives. The Facial Action Coding System could also be used to look at pictures of people and see what their emotions were when that picture was taken. The Facial Action Coding System could and should also be used at everyday jobs. It would let the employees boss/bosses know what emotions they are feeling while working. Which would then let their boss/bosses know whether to fire them or change their work environment. Which in the long run would lead to happy, not as upset, or any other positive emotions the employees could have.

The Facial Action Coding System should definitly be used in classrooms, and even in the workforce. I think this technology should be released to the public as soon as possible. Even though most people can read others facial expressions just by looking at their face.
