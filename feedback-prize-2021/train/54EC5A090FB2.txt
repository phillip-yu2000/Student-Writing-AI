Dear Florida Senator,

The Electoral College system is unfair and irrational. Some people would say that the process is more practical than a popular vote, but after some of the mistakes involving the system, it would be more accurate than popular vote.

Bradford Plumer brings up in his article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong the incident of 2000 (otherwise known as Bush v. Gore.) Over sixty percent of voters wanted a direct election instead of the Electoral College. Electors can always defy the wishes of the people. IN 1960 segregationists almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would opposed John F. Kennedy. Electors have refused to vote for their party' candidate before and have just chosen their own to vote for.

Source one says that in most states there is a winner-take-all system meaning that if one elector gets a majority of votes, then all of the states electoral votes go to that candidate. This is unfair to the voters. If there is only a 100 vote difference and the one with the most gets the electoral votes. The presidential candidates do not even visit the states they know they have no chance in winning. In the election of 2000 neither Rhode Island nor South Carline saw the candidates.

The Electoral College system has flaws. Such as the incidents involving electors and the unfairness of winner-take-all. It is unfair and irrational.       Â
