When people today ask for advice, it's usually for a decision they're going to make. Some people today ask for advice so they can have a better understanding of what to do in the situation. Seeking multiple opinions helps a person make a better choice because you will have ideas to pick from, understand the situation, and it could help future choices.

One reason why seeking opinions help is because you can have multiple ideas to pick from. When you seek for different opinions, some of those ideas will be good, and some ideas will match each other. It's better because some of those ideas would be good for the situation you're in. For example, when my old friend needed help with a family situation, she asked other people for their advice for help,then she ended up using her friends ideas and resolving the situation.

Another reason for why seeking opinions is better is because you can have a better understanding of the situation. When asking for opinions from others, you may be asking them the wrong question. But when you tell people your situation, people will understand and explain the right thing to do in your case. For example, my sisters' friend broke up with her boyfriend because she didn't understand the situation enough to get the right Intel on what to do.

The last reason seeking opinions from others help is because it can help benefit your future. If you are in a bad situation and your friends help you get out of it, you can better yourself, learn from it, and try not to get into the situation again. For example, after my best friend stopped talking with her mean friend, she learned from her mistakes, bettered herself, and now she is more careful on who she befriends.

In conclusion, seeking for multiple opinions is always better. Not only does it give you a better understanding, but gives you ideas, and benefits your future. Wouldn't you rather have a good, well thought out idea then a rushed, and panicked idea?
