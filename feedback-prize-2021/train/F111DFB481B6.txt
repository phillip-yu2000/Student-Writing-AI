Dear senator, voting on a president is a big deal. it decides who has power over the U.S. Now the way we elect our president to me is a very efficient process, this is as you know is electoral college, (EC). For the past 200 some odd years, when the founding fathers created this system, it has worked everytime. yes, there have been recounts but those were human mistakes, not a break in the system. when electing a president, I think we need to keep electoral college

President Obama, in his state of the union adress, said, "If it isn't broken, dont fix it". This is true for EC. it still works so why in the world would we want to change it. Would you fix a car if it ran to it's maximum capacity? Some on the opposite side may say that their is a chance for a tie, isn't that fair though? In any fair competition there is always a chance of a tie.

EC is also the most fair in the sense of political party, (liberals and conservitives). It dosnt favor any one party. It does this by giving equal amount of vote for the size of state and for each to win the greater number of electoral college. "The EC requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."(source 3) This, in basic terms, means that if the southern region is more conservitive (which it is in most cases) doesn't have enough electoral votes to elect a president. The other regions have as equel of a vote as the south does, thus keeping a nice fair election.

In colclusion, EC is, in my opinion, the best and most fair way to elect our leader. other ways may be more efficient but EC is the most far and it has worked since it was created. So these are the reasons that it should remain in use.
