Driveless cars come with some benifits but alot more negatives. The negatives are very costly and could put a lot of people in danger. Driveless cars could not only cause alot confusion and contraversy between manufacters and customers, but can also affect the roads, rules, and laws of the road.

If driveless cars were to be put into action these cars would have to be incredibly smart and be able to function and respond to thier suroundings such as other cars and .pedestrians. This could cost alot of money to make happen and would also put the driver and other people at risk if it were to glitch. If an accident were to happen because of a faliure of a driveless car, alot of controversy between the manufacturer and the customer would heat up. Not only that, but more accidents would be most likely to happen if the roads are split between driveless cars and driven cars. Laws would probaly be past to seprate driven and non-driven cars on the road costing more money to build more roads or ways to transport using driveless cars.

Not only would there be alot of money being invested into driveless cars, but also alot of advanced technology, and even the passing of new laws to prevent roads to get to crowed and to prevent accidents. Driveless cars are not a good idea becasue of all the negatives and all the risk involved.
