I am against driverless cars because of many reasons. One reason i"m against driverless cars because in paragraph 9 it talks about what if there was an accident who would be the fault the manufactur or the driver. I think the manufacturer should be the fault because its not the perosn using the product its the person who build it. They relied on them so they should be hela accountable for the situation. Then it says in paragraph 7 they are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. then turns around and says some manufacturers hope that they can install entertainment in the car for the driver. I believe that if they are geting entertained in the car how would they focus on the road. Also it says such displays can be turned off instantly. Just because it can doesnt mean it will. Another reason is the car is suppose to watch the person then how does the car drive itself.
