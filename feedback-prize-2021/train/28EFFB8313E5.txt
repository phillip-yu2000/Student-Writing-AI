Dear Florida State Senator,

I am writing to you about the position of the Electoral College. It seems that it's difficult to depend on electoral college while the American people should vote for who their president should be in a right way. Their been mistakes and uncertain way to handle the people votes. And I can probably understand why their's a use for Electoral College because of many voters vote but their should be a chance that people should choose.

I argue against electoral college because of we might call the disaster factor. ''The American people should consider themselves lucky that 200 fiasc was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.'' The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer. Why should the electors be responsible for choosing while defying the people? Electors would sometimes refuse to vote their party's candidate and cast whomever they please. That is why votes should counted for each indivdual voters.

Another reason to be against electoral college is that big states gets all the attention than liitle states do. ''The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..'' written in the In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised metod of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner. The big states should get as half of the electoral votes. And the little states should double their votes.

My reasons are fair as they should be. Disaster factors and big states aren't fair, the American should vote for their President in a right way.
