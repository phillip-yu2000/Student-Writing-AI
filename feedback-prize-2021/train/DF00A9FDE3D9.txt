Distance learning can have a different affect on each individual. Students that work well alone would benefit from this but students that do better in a classroom setting would not. This option would take a lot of self control because if you are not doing the work it would hurt you instead of help you. This choice could also be easier because it would also be more one on one or more personal and some students need exactly that to be succesful. Distance learning could also not benefit you because some students wold not take it serously and cheat their way through the year.

Schools offering distance learning made a good choice by doing this because they're giving students with diferent circumstances to have options in learning. There are so many different reasons why students could want this option , if I had the choice I would take it. I say this because being in a classroom having to sit still for over an hour is not for me and spending 8 hours in a place I don't want to be is even worse. Dealing with teachers is also a reason why distance learning could be better because not all teachers want the best for you and that can really make school harder. Attendance also comes into play because a lot of students have attendance problems especially as you go up in grades but with distance learning for an option there is no reason to worry about attendance.

All schools should offer distance learning because some students may really need it and if they have it all students should be informed about it. Learning is a different exprience for everyone so if distance learning benefits you , go for it. Everyone should have an option of how they want to learn because only you know what is best for yourself. Schools should always want what is best for their students so if this is for them help them make this right choice. In conclusion I think distance learning does benefit the right students and could be very useful in their lifes.Â
