I am typing about why drivers should not use phones while driving. This is my opinion and I will be backing it up. It is also a law all over the world. Not texting or being on your phone can save lives if you are driving.

I say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life.

If you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.
