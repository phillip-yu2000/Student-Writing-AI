Every once in a while, we all take a minute to look up at the bright sparkling stars. After a while, you begin to notice that one "star" in particular is brighter than the rest. That "star" is actually Venus. It's so close to Earth that we can actually see it. This intrugues many astronomers and other scientists because it triggers their curiosity. It brings much interest to many people such as the author of this passage. The author of this article suggest that studying Venus is a worth persuit despite the dangers it presents.

Although there are many dangers to studying Venus, there is also a plus side to it. If scientists can build a machine that allows us to get closer to objects on Venus, we could take them back to Earth (paragraph 7). If we could do this, it would help us gain more knowledge on the atmosphere and ground conditions of the planet and help scientists learn how to get humans closer to possibly getting to Venus one day. Human curiosity will likely lure us into many equally intimidating endeavors. For example, in the text it even talks about how far we have come with computers. Knowing this, we should take advantage of our curiosity. imagination, and innovation. This would allow all people to have a better insight of Earth's twin planet, Venus.

In conclusion, scientists have come a long way from the very beginning. Astronomers are inventing marvelous machines that last up to 3 weeks even in horrific weather condition simulators. Astronomers are looking at things in a whole new perspective and will one day make it to Venus. Although it's quite dangerous, the work will be a worthy persuit in the end.
