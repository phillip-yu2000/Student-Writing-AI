I tend to have a negative aspect on driverless cars . I believe we will always need people to operate a car. New cars can do all sorts of stuff like, trafic jam assistance ,they can steer, accelerat ,and break themselves. All of these designs have one thing in common and that is to notify the driver if there is about to be a colision or anything. I also belive that you need human contact when in a car. Would you like to sit in the back of a moving car without a person in the front seat. If there were to be something that the car cant see or feel ahead a fewmiles like a flood how would the car know to stop when it clearly cant see it .how is it soppossed to know what to do. Like if a woman stared to have a sesure or a diabetic or anything like that what would the car be able to do about that. Also i do believe you should always follow the law but in a state of emergencey what if u needed to speed or anything of the sort a car that drives itself could not be allowed to do that surlly it would break rule regulations.

I would not get in a car without a human being behind the wheel I would not put my life in the "hands" of a car. a person has feelings and you cant give that to a machine.
