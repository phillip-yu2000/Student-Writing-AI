I think it is important for students to get good grades. Good grades mean a high likelihood of getting into a good college. A grade C average won't cut it. I think pupil should focus on academics before getting into sports because it will set you up for an exquisite university.

My old sister is in high school, she has a plethora of friends. Most of them are juniors, she's a sophomore. She has few football players in her group of friends. They aren't that bright. They're fantastic at playing football, though. I don't think they'll get into college. You need at least a grade B average to get a football scholarship, if I'm not mistaken? Well, they probably won't get in with that scholarship because they aren't performing so swell academically. They can't depend on that scholarship to bring them to that one special college because nothing is set in stone.

Big brother RELATIVE_NAME, on the other hand, has tiptoed his way to the very top. He plays for his school's soccer team. And his report card shines with A's and barely and B's. How does he do it? He studies a ton completes his homework. In addition, a lot of his time is spent in the field. The colleges will adore him. That proves it is possible to obtain worthy grades and tread on sports.

My point is that anything's possible. Go ahead, Principal, change the school policy to require a grade B average in order to act in school sports or activities. It will only help the students.
