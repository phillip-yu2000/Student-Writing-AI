Dear Principle,

The United States youths' job is to go to school and get educated for the future. Although you can hardly call that a job, it would be better to call it a privilege a privilege. In this country the majority of citizen children do not have to go to working job like adults, their sole job do their work from their job at school. All the children have to do is learn what the teacher says and do the assignments the teacher says. Easy as pie. So when kids are barely passing on a C average there is not an excuse.

They are not doing their job. If they can't do what they are supposed to at the level that is expected, why should they take on more responsibility. It simply does not make sense. If your barely sliding by every day, how much use will you be on the sports field if your barely sliding by on there as well. Personally i get straight A' s and it will be a rare site to see me with a B grade at all. My advice to those who do get C average and make some idiotic excuse is do your work. That is all i simply do. Do your work then, anything else that needs tending comes second. Fun which is not needed is the last and least of your priorities. No if' s, and' s, or but' s, about it as my mother would say. If you get a grade C average you easily have room for improvement so its best that you do improve. It won't be to hard, and you'll benefit from improving your grades. If you do good in school you'll do good on the sports field because you have your priorities straight and you aren't constantly on the border line between flunking your grade or passing. Not only will improving your grades for sports help you play sports, but it'll help your overall GPA and help you learn better and/or more By improving and keeping your grades good it'll become a good habit that will hopefully follow you for the rest of your life, not only for sports.
