Dear Mrs. Principal,

I understand that you're considering changing the school cell phone policy. I've read each policy and firmly believe in the first one stating: "Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times as long as the phones are turned off during class time." I agree with this because the reason cell phones aren't allowed in the first place is that students seem to use them during class time which is distracting not only to them but to other classmates as well. Letting students use their phones in a lunch or free period would not give them the need to use their phones in a class period, however it would not cause a distraction or problem. With this policy, student's phones will be turned off during class time anyway.

A lot of students complain about how they want to talk or text in a free period, if they have nothing productive to do and that seems like a good idea. Their phones can also be used for emergencies as well, just in case.

In conclusion, the idea of a policy of allowing cell phones in free and lunch periods is in my opinion a good idea. The students who support this would agree as well. It is a good idea because they wouldn't be bothering anybody else in the period or cause a distraction. Also it is a good idea just in case an emergency were to come up.

Please take this into consideration.

Sincerely, Student STUDENT_NAME
