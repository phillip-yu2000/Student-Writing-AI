The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) program can be used to detect human emotion through complex algorithms on a advanced computer. Since this program cant work on the average PC, Dr. Huang wrote down some simple instructions that encode different emotions. These instrutions are not as advanced as the FACS program but they are simple enough for the average PC. This can dectect your muscular action units to detect all your current emotions. It can also detect fake emotions as if you were trying to fake a smile or frown just by looking at the major mucles on your face.

Dr. huang would like to use this program for kids in schools. He says the program would help detect when a student is becoming confused or bored of a lesson. When this happens the FACS program will modify the lesson such as an effective human instructor would. This in my opinion could change the learning process for many people and create a new learning system across the world. But this could also take many jobs away ruining the carrer of a teacher. This whole program could end horribly making teachers go on a strike. But no special computer is needed as in the article states that this program could run on a school computer.

All together this program could change schools for the students, and effect the jobs of teachers/professor. This program was made to detect human emotions but can be used as an advanced learning process. The things that this program can do are impressive but Dr. Huang aslo says that humans can also detect emotions. But a teacher can't teach every student in their ways needed, teachers teach the whole class using the technique. Overall this program should be tested in a few schools before going active to each school.
