When you vote for president you want to vote for who you choose. Thats not how it always works though. We you vote for president you are actually voting for a canadiate who will then go aand vote for president. Is that really fair? Many people dont think so. The electoral college should be abolished because it isnt always fair, who cant be sure if your voting right and it is not democracy.

When you vote for a canadiate you trust they will vote for who they say they will. but is it always true? what is the canidate feels like they dont agree with that person any more and vote for a diffrent one? You and evrybody else who voted for that canadaite are now voting for an opposing canadiate. is that fair to who ever voted for that canadiate now?

You can never be sure if you are voting right. what if that canadiate dose not vote like they are suppoed too. "Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always." says Plumer about the chance a canadiate will vote for someone else. You can never really trust someone you have never met. Humans are very dispitefully creatures, we all lie snd decive. how can you trust a random canadite just because he says he or she will vote for who you want to vote for? wouldnt you rrather vote yourself?

Democracy is giving people the rigth to help govern thre own countray. Isnt the electoral collage taking that right away? Even though this is in the Constitution it is unconstutional. "At the most basic level, the electoral college  is ufair to all voters." says Plumer. He is corect about the electoral college and its unfairness to US citizens.

The electoral colleage may have had a good reasson for existing when they made the constution but that was about a 100 years ago... Dont you think we have chaged since then? The anwser is we have and so should they way our goverment works. If we keep the same goverment into the future where everything will change we will be in for a load of trouble.
