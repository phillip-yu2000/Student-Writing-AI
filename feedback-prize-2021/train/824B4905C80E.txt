You can do what you love to do. We can go sightseeing wherever we are. But it might take a few days to even weekes to get to where we are going. When you are in different countries you can help out people in need. That will make you not just worry about yourself but other people and their needs. You can play sports in some of the empty animal cages where they were housed until they got to where they needed to be. It is much more than an adventure.
