Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a big honor. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you get to help animals, you can vist many places, you learn responsibility, and you get to have fun on board after the animals are uploaded.

I know this becasue in the text it says UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and the mules that were shipped overseas. Another reason is in paragraph 9 it says Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. "I'm grtaeful for the opportunity," he says. "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs." And that awarness stayed with him, leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.

Those are some resons to join the Seagoing Cowboys. You get to help animals, you vist new places, and you learn responsibility. That is why you should consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys.
