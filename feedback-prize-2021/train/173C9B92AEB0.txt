I think the principal should not change the policy for school sport because most kids try hard and get below a c and they might want to try out for a sport it should not made on there grades. Another reason is that no every one has a B average so why should they try even harder just to play a sport. I would not like it if i had to stay at a B average to play a sport. I think the student should have a C average to play a sport so they have a better chance at staying on the team. It would be hard for the students to stay at the B average because they would have school and then they would have practice or game so they don't have very much time to do other stuff. The last reason the principal should not change the sport grade average is because it gives student something to do after school.
