Dear State Senator,

I strongly believe that we should change our election to popular vote. The Electoral College has a ton of problems that can not be worked out. In the artical "What is the Electoral College?" it states in line 7 that, "most states have a "winner-take-all" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate." I understand how majority rules, but the number electoral votes should be proportional to the popular vote. I am aware that, "The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast." as stated on line 22 of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. However, I would rather be in a situtation where I know my vote counted for the president, than use the Electoral College and avoid ties that could still happen. "It is the electors who elect the President, not the people." as stated in line 15 of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, it states that "That those electors could always defy the will of the people." What is the point in voting if the will of the people can be defied? I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote.
