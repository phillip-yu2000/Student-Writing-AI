Honestly, we shouldnt have the Electoral College. If I voted for a president, I really wouldnt be voting for the president, I would be voting for a state of electors and they would elect the president. Your really not voting for what you want, your really voting for there electors. You dont even know who these electors are or who there gonna vote for. Why should we have this Electoral College if were not even voting for who we want, its like were not even voting. Electors can always defy the will of the people and just vote for who ever they wanted and just turn there back on there own party. Like back in 1960, the segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost accomplished in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would go against John F. Kennedy.

With popular vote there most likely will never be a tie. With the Electoral College there have been cases of really close tie deadlines. As you can tell from the passage, the Electoral College is old and unfair and never should be used. With the winner-take-all system in every state, candidates dont go to states they know they wont win. When the 2000 campaign was going on, seventeen states didn't see the candidates not once, these states were Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in twenty-five of one the largest media markets didn't get to see not one campaign ad.
