Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing you this letter today to talk about the new policy of at least a B average to play sports. I do not favor this idea because most of our athletes in the school have only C averages. Our grading system for sports should stay as it is also because there really is no purpose of even having sports if you don't have good players. If you do decide to change this most of the parents and student-athletes would be upset.

Also what made you want to change the rule that you must have a B average instead of a C? Was there some sort of commotion about how people think this school doesn't have enough good grades or that were not smart enough? If so you need to tell them that just because our boys football and basketball team are undefeated does not mean we are not smart.

Our academic program here is already good as can be and i do not believe we can up how well we are anymore which would be pushing the limit. Thank you for reading this letter and taking time out of your day. I hope you will consider not changing the overall letter grade our student-athletes must have.

Your Student,
