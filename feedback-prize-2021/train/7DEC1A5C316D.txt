Dear senator

I would like to ask you to please change voting regulations from the Electoral College to popular vote. The Popular vote would work much better because voters are not really voting for a presedent we are voing for a slate of electors.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. An example of this is in 2000, Gore and Bush were canidates, and when the votes were counted Gore have more popular votes but less electoral votes then Bush, this was the forst time that happend sence the election of 1888. Another example of the electoral college regulations being unfair is in 2012 when Obama recived 61.7 percent of the electoral vote as opose to only 51.3 percent cast for him and Romney. And a nationwide tie with electoral votes is possable because of the number of votes is 538, its an even number although it is highly unlikely.

The winner-take-all method of awarding all electoral votes to 1 specific canadate is unfair aswell because as we have seen in 2012 the canadates focus mainly on serton states because all states are worth a diffrent amount of electoral votes. Such as California being worth 55 votes and Washinton state being priced at 12 votes or New Mexico being at a total cost of 5 votes.

In the end the electoral vote is unfair. I just wish that you would change the voiting regulations from bring and electoral vote to being a popular vote.
