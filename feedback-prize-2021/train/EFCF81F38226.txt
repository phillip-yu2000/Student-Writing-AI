Driverless cars, am I for or against the idea of them? I am against the thought of driverless cars for two main reasons. One, drunk drivers and two, kids using the cars.

Technology has been becoming more advanced over the years from phones all the way up to cars now. In paragraph four lines one through two says, "Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars."

Smarter cars are not going to make the world safer because not everyone will be able to afford the new "smart car". These new "smart cars" will probably be hybrids running on electricity instead of gas. Which will make gas prices for normal cars sky rocket.

Now thinking of driving safely that means no drinking, texting, or sometimes even eating. With these driverless cars more than likely people will go out to drink and take there driverless car with them thinking it will still be safe to drive even though they have been drinking. Just because the car drives by its self you still have to hold the wheel. "special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel." paragraph seven line three. Thinking of safety also includes the protection of kids. Teens will think that it's okay to take their parents driverless car because all they will have to do is hold the wheel which is wrong because in paragraph seven lines six through eight reads "They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents." In conclusion the driverless car would not be safe for this generation.
