I think the use of technology to read the emotions expressions of student in a calssroom is valuable. The reason why I think reading the emotions on the expressions of other students is valuable is that it would be important to know how your student is feeling. It is important to show love to others when they are feeling so type of way other then happy. It would help teachers understand why a student is acting the way he/she is.

It could be helpful to know how your student is feeling. A computer that knows when your happy or sad would be helpful to teachers. Having A classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored would help teachers know if her students are struggling with what is being taught or if they need help with anything. It would save a teachers time asking students if they are in need of help because sometimes a student might be shy to raise there hand or embarassed that he is not getting the hang of it but his other classmates are.

The use of a technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom would be a life changing thing it would be helpful to know how your student is feeling. You wouldn't want student to go on with there day feeling the way they are and if there going through a tough time. A student will never express themselves to a teacher they can act one way but truly feel another way on the inside. So if a student cant tell a teacher hwo there feeling a computer could tell it all without being shy scared about it.
