Dear principal,

I think you should allow students to use their cell phones during lunch periods and other free time as long as they keep them off during class time. The reason I think you should do this is because students will use their phones no matter what as long as the teachers don't catch them. Another reason is because a lot of people like to use their phones, and at lunch periods it is our free time to do what we want, and we can waste our time by using our cell phones instead of exercising and working all the weight off we gained from texting too much but that's our choice. The last reason I could think of is if we have no friends at our school and a lot at another we could call or text them during lunch so we don't have to socialize with a bunch of mean people we don't get along with at all. There are some reasons I could think of to not let kids use their phones during lunch like someone could run into the person who is texting and then they would drop their phone and they might get in a fight.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME. :)
