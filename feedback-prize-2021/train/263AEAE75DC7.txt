I am for the develpment of these cars because i feel like it would be safer and everyone would have a ride and wouldn't have to walk. It would also save a lot of gas and energy from all the cars that won't be used, and only the driverless cars would be using gas. The driverless cars offer far more flexibility than a bus as well. The article also mentions such cars would change the world.

If the cars crahsed or stopped working who's fault would it be? Will the human have to drive the car in and out of the driveway as well ? The cars are a great idea because like i said it would save a lot of gas and money, and everyone would have a ride somewhere and they wouldn't have to walk in the cold weather or rainy weather. These cars have postive and negitive things. If the car runs on google for transportation and the internet shuts down then what wil happen ?

I feel that if they test out the cars mulitple times and they are successfull , then yes allow the cars . Would we be able to keep the cars we have now ? Or would we have to get rid of them and just use the driverless cars ? I also believe it would be a lot safer because it would save the cops a lot of trouble, if you decided to get drunk then you wouldn't have to drive home.
