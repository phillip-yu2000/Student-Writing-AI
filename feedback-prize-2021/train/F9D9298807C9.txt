Dear state Senator,

I am in full favor of the Electoral College process. I think that this process is a great way to elect president because we rely on the electors vote. By relying on the electors vote, we don't have to worry about the popular votes messing up the election. I say messing up because a lot of people aren't paying attention to the election, so they vote out of a random pick. This could influence the presidential outcome of who becomes president.

Also, the Electoral College process goes to a series of elections. This is better because when we vote for the president, we are actually voting for the electors. After that election, the electors vote for the president on a more serious note. The electors take charge of your your state, and vote for the most reasonable president. They discuss the bad and good qualities protraying to each president. Based on thier dussicion, America will have the best president there is.

To add on, the election process by popular voting can be easily screwed up. This process can be messed up by none serious voters who choose the worse president. This election process can be messed up by people choosing a president and not even paying attention to the qualities that the president has. The president that they pick could have some awful characteristics, along with the presidents decisions.

To conclude, we should keep the Electoral College process and not even think about the popular vote process. The Electoral College process, we rely on the electors to make the right decision for America. We don't want a bad president by going with the popular voting process. This is why we should keep the Electoral College process.
