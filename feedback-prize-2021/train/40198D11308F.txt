The author is has lots of good points that were very interesting in the passage. He or she adressed that although it is moving up in the world and it is bring us closer to the future they're a lot of faults in this idea. We maybe able to create a car that is able to drive itself and is able to hand a normal road but in paragraph 7 it states that "All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills", this means that we are close but we still have a little longer to perfect the driverless car. The main problem is what the author was trying to inform us about in paragrah 9 is if we get into an accident while on the road whos fault would it be the driver or the manufacturer? This creates a very big promblem with the public and the manufacturer, which can only be settled in the court house. We all want to see the future and what it can bring,but this example alone shows us the difficulties that we aregoing to face in order to move up in the world.

Some manufacturers are trying hard on this idea and are creating these cars and are testing them out some examples of these manufacturers would be BMW, Nissan, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz are all trying in the idea. Nissan, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz all plan on having cars that drive themselves and will maybe relseased to the public in the year 2020. This is very close to us and it is exciting to know that there will be a future car that will be able to drive its self but, the public will have to be very careful with the car and so does the manufacures. Im excited for a car that will be able to drive its self but, I am very sceptical about this idea it will have to very safe for the driver and it will have the driver on the alert for a very long time. Good luck to the public and good luck to the manufacturers in my opinoin you will need it.
