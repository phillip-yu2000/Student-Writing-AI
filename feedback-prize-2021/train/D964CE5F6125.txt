In our solar system there are many planets such as Jupiter, Mars, and Neptune, but not many people talk about Venus. The planet Venus that could be the only planet that was "Earth-like" millions of years ago. What could be better visiting our "sister" planet?

The author cliams that it's worth the experience to visit the planet Venus, although knowing of all the dangers that could happen. In paragragh 5, it states, "... NASA has one oarticularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus." The author is saying that there possibly could be a way to get humans to the planet Venus. Also in paragraph 4, it says,"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the Earth-like plaent in our solar system." The author is stating that Venus prabably once was a planet with living creatures.

Getting to Venus seems easy but not exctly. Despite the scorching heat of 800 degrees fahrenheit described in paragraph 3, there are also, "... erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.." Our sister planet seems to be the only planet that was like Earth at one point. Although despite the heavy atmosphere of 97% of carbon dioxide, humans wouldn't be able to survive that kind of extreme environment. The pursuit of getting to explore Venus is still a working progress.

As the author is passionate and fascinated on visting the planet Venus, it is still something NASA is also passionate about, working on and is hoping to achieve. The scorching heat and heavy atmosphere along with dangerous weather climates, it is still something to figure out and pass to get to their vision of a success visit to Venus.
