Dear, Principal what's your face

Having phones legal in school would be a good thing towards students focus and activity during class. So, I chose policy 1. I think it will be good for the students to have a way to express them selves more in the hallways or at lunch. This then makes the kids pay more attention in classes. All of the kids in this school are being socially deprived by teachers always yelling at them about having their phone in their pocket. It's like we don't even get any rights anymore! But having phones to use in school the students can communicate between friends from across the lunchroom if one of their friends didn't get put at their table. You might be saying, "Why can't they just get up and walk over to their table and talk?" But that's the thing, we can't! Our lunchroom rules say that we have to stay in our seats or ask a teacher to go somewhere unless our zone is called. But allowing kids to use cell phones in school will make communicating easier, help them know what time it is and if they are running late to a class they can text or call a friend to tell the teacher they are going to be late. Even though their could be the hazard of kids stealing other peoples phones. But it was their fault for letting them know about where you keep your phone in your locker. To end on a good note phones can help our learning and social life during class or in the hallway.
