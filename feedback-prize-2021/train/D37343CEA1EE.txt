To the principal.

I believe your possible policy change on sports participation standards is a good idea. I think students should have to get a B-average or higher, to participate in any sports activities. I believe this is a good idea because it will encourage students to achieve more, and work hard in school. Many students that are in sports activities are barely passing school with a C or lower, if you were to change the policy these students would want to raise their grades to stay in sports. While the students begin to work harder, the parents might pass word about how well this school works. More people may enrol students and spread the popularity of the school. With the schools new found popularity, and increase on students we may have more money for the school to use for, new books, better books and computers. Other schools may want to support our methods and expand the policy all across the city or state. In the process of all of this the student dropout rate may lower as well, because students will want to learn more. I support your policy 100%, but there could possibly be bad outcomes as well. Students may become furious and quit all sports, and possibly school in the future. The teachers may get annoyed with the amount of students trying to over achieve and quit, or punish the students. Parents enrolling more students may overcrowd the school and its property causing the state to shut it down. As you can see the good outcomes overcome the bad, and many of the bad come after the good. Please remember these are only idea, there is no promise that the change will cause the good or bad outcomes, but there is also no promise they will not happen either.

sincerely

A student.
