Driverless cars next big thing ? Sergey Brian cofounder of Google sure does thinks so. Sergey thinks drivless cars could be the next public-transport taxi system.

First off I agree with driverless car. Driverless cars sensors could help prevent accidents. The text states " The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings." This quote for the passage explains that the cars great technology is a big help for preventing accidents.

Although being in a driverless car might get boring , you can look at it has assisting. For example when your at a stoplight and your not paying attention to when its your turn. The driverless car has already got you covered. another exaple is when your trynna park and you're worried about hitting another car or pulling up on the curb the sensors on the car is a great help.

In conclusion, Google driverless cars sounds like a good idea. its helpful, safe,and very thought out. So why not make driverless cars the next big thing?
