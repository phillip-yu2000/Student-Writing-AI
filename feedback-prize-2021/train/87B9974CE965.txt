Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME and i would like to know why can't students that have a C. on their report card can't be on any sports and students that have a B. can if they want to be in sports they can if they are good at sports and not good at other things that's not a reason so the they cant be on sports. if i had a B. on my grades and i be volleyball and then a have a C. would you take out of volleyball. because if you take me out of volleyball that would be unfair gust because i have a C.

so i think that's not a specific reason so they cant be on sports i think that if they have more than 15 referrals they cant be in any sports because thy are been bad they don't want to do their work on class and they just want to be talking and not doing what their suppose to do well that's an excuse for not letting them be on sports so I recommend you to change the school policy in another way not just because people have a C. they cant be in sports. that is just wear so if was you ill change it so they would be better that's what i think.
