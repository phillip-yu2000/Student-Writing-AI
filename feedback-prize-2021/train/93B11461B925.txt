Do you think this should be done? I think that the principal should make students participate in an activity because it will give students something to do and it gives you a break from stressful things. It also helps you get some physical activity and keeps you healthy.

I think if the principle made this choice it would be great. Some people go home after school and just play video games and sit inside. If this choice was made people would be doing something and not being lazy all day. When I come home from school everyday I am so bored and have nothing to do. If I had to participate in something it would give me something to do after school.

Also I think if the principle made choice then it would give you a break from stressful things. Every day I come home from school and have nothing to do. So my mind starts making me think about my grades. It also makes me think about college. Those are two things that stress me out. I am worried that if my grades are not high enough I won't be able to get into a good college. So if I had something to do after school everyday it would take my mind off things.

For the last thing it helps with physical activity. If you are at home and have nothing to do it sucks. So if you go do a sport it will make you more fit and healthy. When I was in 4th grade I was a really big kid then I got into sports and started lifting weights. I am still a big kid but I have lost weight and gained lots of strength which has made me more confident.

Those are the reasons why I think that we should be made to do at leastÂ one thing. It would help with lots more and make life easier in the long run. I think other people would disagree because they don't wanna be forced to do something but life isnt always your choice.
