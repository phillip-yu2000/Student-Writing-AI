I think that not having cars is a good thing for these small suburban cities cause theyre only like a mile or two so its really not that far.

From what i've heard in this passage and from the sources is that its a big stress reliever and it is to help out the earth there will be less traffic jams,less pollution and more interacting with people cause face it people dont interact socailly anymore and if they do its most likely over the internet.

Another reason i think we should cut down on car use or at least car pull in vans is cause it will leave less emissions in the air and it'll hopefully help the ozone layer repair itself to its natural state

And in conclussion im all for it cause I think that it'll help people get out and get fit and there will be less crashes there be less stress from driving(roadrage/roadragers).
