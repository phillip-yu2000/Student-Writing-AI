Cars Driving On Their Own?

I am against Driverless Cars. This is because you can't trust the computers in the cars to not make mistakes. If the car makes a mistake and the passengers get hurt, there is no one to blame. What if the car causes a wreck and kills someone? How will their family have closure? They won't. It's not like you can put a car in jail like you can a reckless driver. These are some things to think about.

People would use this car as an excuse to go out dinking more. This would cause an increase in alcholism, leading to more deaths from liver failure. It would make it easier for people to conduct drive by shooting and get away with it. Even if they got caught weeks later, they would have had the time to make it seem like they weren't near the area because computers can be minipulated. Crimes would extremly high and there would be no one to take the blame.

Another question is, who would be responsible? Would it be the maker of the car or the "driver?" How many people would get tickets, because the police can't be sure that it wasn't the car that was swirving in between the lines? What if there is a bad signal and the cars stop in the middle of the highway? You can't trust a car that drives itsel, it's just not safe.

These cars would make it easier for rapists to track their targets. The cars would be putting lives in danger because people could track where they were at. Serial killers would be able to find people and not be thought of as a suspect because they wouldn't have to go near the person to find them. Is that really what seems best for the world?

It would mean people spending more money to buy and fix these cars. The minimum wage would go up causing the prices of other things to go up. The economy would hit a low and we wouldn't have the money to cover it. It is a ignorant idea to hav cars that drive all on their own. Think about that next time you think it's a good idea. Think about the peoples lives that would be put in danger.
