To the principal:

I believe that students shouldn't be able to use their phones at school because they become distractions for learning. If they use their phones at free time, they could be texting or calling their friends in other classes and cause disruptions. Teens tend to not care about rules and do whatever they want because they feel rules don't apply to them. they will still have their phones on during classes.

Students should not be given the benefit of using their phones at school. They will just abuse their privilege and cause trouble in the classrooms. First, students won't listen to the rules. They won't listen because they feel they are free to do whatever they want and no one can tell them what to do. They will still use their phones in class even if you make phone usage more available. Second, students will be late to class after breaks because they will be so caught up in their phones that they won't pay attention to their class times. Students will probably text other students in class who will have their phones on and disrupt the class. Finally, students will not pay attention in class. They will not pay attention because they are too focused on when they will get a text or a break so they can use their phones. There will be a lot more kids in trouble because of the urge to access their phones. All in all, giving students time to use their phones at school is a mistake and will lead to chaos in class.

Students will not benefit from the access to phone usage. Their attitude will make them more stubborn when they can't have something they want. They won't do well in school because their phones become a major distraction. Do not give them this privilege, they will abuse it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
