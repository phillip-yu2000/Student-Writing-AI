If we want driverless cars so bad why dont we just take a taxi or a train. I think that we shouldnt try and make driverless cars just yet because we dont have the money to do so.

To make driverless cars we would need millions of dollars to even start constructing the ideas. Like it said in the article no car today is driverless, they may say it is but there is some situations where the car will still need human assistance. I think driverless cars would actually be pretty dangerous because what happens if the panel where the car is running from messes up or shuts down, then your car would have major problem or go off course from where you wanted to go. Another reason why I think that driverless cars are a dangerous idea is because what happens if the car breaks down on road side? Are we gonna have a google engineer come from 1,000 miles away in 10 minutes to help us? Probably not.

Yes driverless cars would be nice, but what I am saying is that driverless cars could also be very dangerous, and put our lives in dangerous just to have luxury. To me i dont think that having a driverless car is worth putting my life on the line for. In conclusion driverless cars would be nice, but we dont have the money to afford it, and they would be a very dangerous project to construct and test out.
