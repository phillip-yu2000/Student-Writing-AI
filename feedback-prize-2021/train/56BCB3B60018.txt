Have you ever wanted to take care of animals? Well, I did. Hi, my name is Luke Bomberger. One day my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe with him and of course I didn't say no because I knew this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. So I went with him and that same year 1944 I decided along with my friend to sign up to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Being a Seagoing Cowboy consists of going overseas while taking care of horses, young cows, and mules.

This job may not sound very fun but let me tell you it is. For example, when I turned 18 we were sent to aboard the SS Charles W.Wooster with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them. This might seem like a lot but trust me seeing the Acropolis in Greece was something special. I also had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. These were some of the most fun and extroardinary part of our trips.

There were some fun parts but also dangerous parts. One time while it was raining it was my turn to check on the animals and make sure they were safe but I slipped and almost flew off board. The good thing was that a strip of metal caught me. I was relieved to still be alive but I couldn't work for a couple of days because I had some cracked ribs.

Even though I had to work hard and do some risking stuff. I had a great time. It was quite an adventure that I wouldn't change for anything. Just think you could have an amazing experience like me or maybe even better, but what is certain is that you will have quite an extroadinary adventure.
