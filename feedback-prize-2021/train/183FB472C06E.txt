Talking to other people in getting more advice from them instead of just one person is good, because it can help you make better choices, and help you learn stuff you probably dont know.

Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Because it allows a person to seek multiple options. This way a person could sort the options out in their head and make the decision faster. Whenever someone needs advice, they should ask more than one person so they can have more choices to choose from. If i was in a situation in I needed some advice or help I would ask a lot of people for advice like my mom, some of my friends, and family members. My mom helps me with surrent things like if im crying or going through something bad I would talk to her about it. Some of my friends helps me when im having a bad day at school they make me laugh. My family members are always there for me because when im down they will always text me asking am I ok or text me in say do you want to go do something so you can cheer up.
