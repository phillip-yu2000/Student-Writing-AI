Dear principal,

I agree with policy number 1 because it gives students the use of their cell phones if they need to use them. I also agree with it because then students would not be tempted to use their phone during class or when the teacher is talking, giving them more time to focus on their schoolwork. Another reason that policy 1 is better is sometimes the students need to use their cell phones in case there is some kind of emergency and the student needs to be contacted by someone like family or friend.

I strongly agree that the students shouldn't be using their cell phones during the school day because a teacher could be talking when they are using their phone, which would be distracting to some of the other students that are paying attention. Also the students would get bad grades because they pay more attention to the cell phones than there teacher. The students should get to use phones but only if there is a designated time, emergency, or if during a lunch period. However many students that don't have a cell phone could or would be distracted by those who do and wouldn't pay attention to their teachers, work, and class.

Policy 2 also prevents kids from having freedom of when they can and can't do certain things, which would make the students want to use the phones even more because they are not given the option to. Students would also think they could use the cell phones because they were told they can't. That is why I would say policy number 1 would be the right one to choose so you don't have the students using the phones whenever they want and you could have more paying attention in class. Also with more work getting done in the class you would have less of the kids getting in trouble or disrupting the class. and it would give the kids something to look forward to in school.
