You are getting ready to go out for lunch, you have an outfit that you really want to wear but you don't know it it matches or not. You go to ask your friends and family but they all give you different opinions and nobody has the same opinion. Asking multiple people for their opinion can be challenging because the people you ask may not all have the same opinion. Taking multiple opinions and combining them to give you an answer is good because it might help you to make a better choice than only having one opinion or your own opinion. Getting multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can get different points of view, different experiences, and new ideas.

People have different points of view which can help someone make a good decision. Nobody is the same and everybody has a different way of viewing things. Everyone has their own points of view on things because nobody thinks the same. Seeing somebody else's view on things can open up your mind to see new things. You may see black stripes on a zebra but somebody else might see white stripes because they think outside the box. To take a look at what somebody else sees is to see through their eyes. Looking through someone else's eyes may lead you to think differently and have different opinions on things that you didn't think of before. Having somebody else's point of view can help you make better decisions because it might help you look at things in a way you haven't seen before.

The people that you ask for an opinion from may have had an experience with the same thing that you are asking about. The people you are asking for an opinion from may have had a good or bad experience. People that have been through the same thing that you need help with may have made mistakes and they can tell you what not to do and you can learn from their mistakes. Learning from somebody else's mistakes can help you because it might get you out of a possible bad situation. If someone tells you that they were in that same situation and it ended badly because of a decision they made, you would want to make a different decision because mostlikely you would want the situation that ends well. Taking other people's advice and learning from their mistakes can help you make better decisions.

Taking someone else's opinion into account can be good because they might have new ideas that you haven't thought of before. Some people think outside the box and have new and different ideas from you. You may just have a basic thought on something when someone else has a completely new idea that you would not of thought of without them saying it. You can take somebody's idea, edit it, and make it your own. Taking somebody's idea you are not really stealing or copying you are just putting a good idea from someone else and making it your own to fit into what you need. Talking to people who have new ideas is a good thing and can help you make better decisons because you can take their ideas and make it to fit your own situation.

Talking to multiple people to get their opinions on something can help someone make better choices because they will get someone else's point of view, learn from other people's mistakes, and take new ideas and make it their own. Taking other opinions instead of your own is a good thing because it will help you think in new ways.Â
