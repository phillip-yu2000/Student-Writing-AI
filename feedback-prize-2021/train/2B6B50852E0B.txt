I am not agree that students would benefit attending classes from home. the students will not be able to know more people. They will spend time only at home. They would not know how fun is attend school. There are some people who can't attend school but they know how it feels being at the school.

The people who takes classes from home is not able to meet people. I think know people around you is a good point. Students could be more comfortable having people around them. I think stay at home everyday could stress out the students. They feel more freely being at school.

The students will spend the whole day at home. I think for some of them would be boring stay at home because in some cases they can't attend school. Spend a lot of time behind a screen could hurt them eyes. They could feel stressed being at home without not having friends to hang out. They could feel lonely not having friends to comunicate or spend time.

The people who attend classes from home will miss how is the school. They miss what happens during the day in a classroom. They don't know how great is meet your friends and walk around the school. They miss the great and fun activities in the school and classroom. They don't have the same fun of being in the school,work with partners,groups and know people from other places.

It is a good thing attend classes online or video conferencing and it benefit the students to focus more in classes but i am disagree. I am disagree because i think is a good thing have people around you and make friends. Be out of home would be a good way to stay out of stress and feel more comfortable. Being at school could be a good way to be happy,participate in activities and talk with people than being in four walls the whole day.
