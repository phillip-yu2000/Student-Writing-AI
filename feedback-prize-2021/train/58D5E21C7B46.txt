The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good idea because you are able to explore many new places, you are able to help people, and you can serve your service as a Seagoing Cowboy if you are drafted to the military. From the amazing experience Luke had you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

It is an amazing opportunity to help people and to explore new places it also served as work if you were drafted to go to the military. Luke could help people because it was World War II in Europe and many countries were left in ruins so he had to help recover their food supplies, animals, and more. Luke also got to explore new places while being in the program he got to go to Europe and China he got to tour an excavated castle in Crete and see the Panama Canal on his way to China. When Luke was drafted but he didn't have to go to war because he served his service as a Seagoing Cowboy. This evidence proves that Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity. Although, there are many dangers to the sea during this job such as slipping and possibly falling out of the ship. However, there are many more good things than bad thisng during this job it is hard but you get to help others whle putting yourself in danger.

Based on the evidence in the passage and what Luke's experience was like the Seagoing Cowboys program is an very good opportunity. It allows you to help others in need, it also lets you serve your service in the military if your are drafted, and during it you may also get to explore several new places you have never been.
