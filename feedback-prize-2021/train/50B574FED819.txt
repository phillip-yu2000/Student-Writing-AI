Dear Principal,

Yes, community service is important for kids to take part in. Although, I do not think it is fair for all children to be required to perform community service without a choice. First of all, some students take part in many things and barely have any time to finish what they need to do already. Many students have extra curricular activities they take part in which barely leave them time to finish their homework. Some students hardly even get time to themselves or to hang out with their friends and just be a kid! If you add on community service work to their already too busy lives, they will start over booking their time and become completely worn out. This could even lead to bad grades in school! Not to mention how much stress this could put on a student which is very unhealthy for a child and could even lead to them having anxiety attacks! Students should not be required to perform community service.

In addition, it is unfair to force students to do things they do not want to do, especially if it has to do with physical work such us picking up litter, etc. They should have a choice whether or not they want to do this, and maybe to make it more fair extra credit could be offered to children that decide to perform community service. This will let the kids that want to help the community be rewarded for their extra hard work. In conclusion, I feel that it should not be required for students to take part in community service and that they should have a choice of whether or not they want to take part in it.
