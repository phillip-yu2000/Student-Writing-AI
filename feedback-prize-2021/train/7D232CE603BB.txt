Cell Phones at School

Cell phones should most definitely be allowed at school. Many kids have them, and many have the urge to use them. Principals should change the school policy about using cell phones during free time and passing periods. Most kids today have cell phones and would love to be able to text or call a friend from another school during their lunch break or free time. Kids have many things to talk to people about, but just don't always have the time when there busy talking to their other friends.

Being able to use cell phones at school would make kids much happier, and might even get the students to want to pay attention or learn more. When you give privileges to kids, they will be happy and will want to "kiss up" to their teachers so they can keep their rights of having their phone out during free time.

It makes plenty of sense only allowing them to use on their own time. I'm sure teachers wouldn't mind this rule as long as it will not disrupt class. Being allowed to use your phones at school would be the next big thing. Students would be super happy and would have way more fun at school than they usually do. If they do at all... not to say that school is not fun.

Personally, I would love to be able to use my phone at school. It would make school that much more fun for me. If I was allowed to use my phone on my own time, I would take full advantage of my opportunity. I would talk to my other friends from other schools who also would love to have the privilege. If we were allowed to use our phones, we would pay that much more attention. So principals, please allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are off during class time.
