Dear Principal,

First, I think the sports and other activities are a good idea. That will be a lot of fun. Students will love that idea. Students will even try harder in school so they can be in sports and other fun stuff. They will even do there homework every single day. Also, they will study for test just to do fun things at school. Which I think that is very good. Students grades are very important so they can be in a team like basketball, flag football, volleyball, or softball. I think lots of students will like to try out for one of those teams. Also, it will be fun to have some fun activities once in a while. Students can even read more and make there point goal every triad if they read at school and at home every day. It also helps students on there grades when ever they pass a test. So that is why i think students need to try harder if they want to do fun activities at school. I hope we get to have sports and activities at our school!
