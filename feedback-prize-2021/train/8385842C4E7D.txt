The way I think about this articale is that I dont think that it will be a good idea for use. because what if you where puting on a face. If we put this technology into are computers it would mess with people that look like they are struguling for a person that is just boted and does not want to do it. So they would wast there time if it would go throw a deminstration about how to do it. Even if was a thing that was just for your computer it would not be fun. Do to the fact that it mite mess with what you are trying to do.

One the part with people puting on a face what if you where smiling but was acutually sad just for the fact that you had to. Many times when you see a picture it may look like he/she are acting like that but are actualy not so it could through it off and mabey get you confused on the way.

On the other hand it could help you like if some one was thinking of some thing and you could not help them or dont know if to do somthing or not. Mabey you could make it into something small like a app on a phone. People would use it to have fun with while walking or try to make it a game among friends that are around you and see if you can tell one anothers expreshons.
