I think you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I think you should becuase you get to visit places that you might never get to go to in life or to see things that you may no get a chance to witness.

For example in text, Luke found as much time as he can to have as much fun. Him and his cowboy friends played baseball, vollyball games, etc. They also had some tournaments, like fencing, boxing, reading whatever they can think of to pass time.

Some more infomation from the article is The boat ride was fun and they had chances of seeing countrys like Europe and China and Greece. They took gondala rides in Venice, Italy, In the streets with water. If I was there i would enjoy myself more than other. Even in after the war in Europe was over left in ash and all they still went to the cities.

In conclusion this shows that you should participate in alot of things, Because you will never kniw what will come your way. It happend to me, my friends, even you one day. But even when things go wrong like war or trouble theres all ways is a little light. So Thats why i would particapate in the Seagoing Cowboys Program.
