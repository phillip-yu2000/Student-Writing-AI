Principal,

I am writing you today on behalf of the idea of students needing a B average to participate in school sports and other activities. I strongly agree with you by requiring students to have a B average. Students need to be disciplined in and out of school. If they care about sports, they need to start caring about their school work also.

If students have below a B average, they do not play until they get their grades up. During practice they will be off to the side studying and doing homework. When students get into high school and college they have to have a B average to even be able on the team! If your star player has below a B average then you need to sit him until his grades get up. If you start losing the player and the team will learn their lesson that if they don't have a B average they'll have to watch their team from the sideline. Students need to start maturing and becoming disciplined when it comes to school work. School needs to come first before sports and other activities because when we grow up, we will need to have at least a B average.

So I am on your side on the idea of students have at least a B average to be able to participate in sports and activities.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
