How can multiple opinions help you make a better choice? It is said that when people ask for advice they tend to talk to more than one person. I think it's a good idea, because when you have multiple opinions then that means you have multiple options.

When you have more than one option you tend to find the better choice more easily. One opinion sometimes isn't enough, and you need more in case the last one wasn't as good as the first. If you tend to stick with only one choice then you have a high chance of it being a bad one, but if you have more than one choice you tend to find more choices and have a higher chance of picking the right one.

When you have more than one option you tend to find the better choice more easily. Finding the right choice can be difficult if you only ask one person, so you ask more people so you can find out more easily which is the right one. Having the right opinion can be a lot more easier to find with more than just opinion. You can make things easier by checking with someone else after talking to one person.

One opinion sometimes isn't enough, and you need more in case the last one wasn't as good as the first. Ounce you ask the first person for there opinion you can sometimes be unsatisfied and want more. If there is an opinion that someone gives you and it doesn't really help then you use the other opinions you asked from other people as backups. Sometimes when looking for the right decision you need more than one option.

If you tend to stick with only one choice then you have a high chance of it being a bad one, but if you have more than one choice you tend to find more choices and have a higher chance of picking the right one. When you have more opinions from different people you have a higher chance of finding the right one. If you only have one option though you tend to have a lower chance of finding the right one. Having more options give you a better view of what you are looking for and gives you a chance to look and see how close you are.
