Dear principal,

I reconsider the schools cell policy 1 because it true that the cell phones are hard for people to work in school but the teacher should expect it to because the teacher are always texting when there give the class and they always think that is us only? I say that because some teacher are doing that to and, it not fair for the student's. so I think that they should use it when they are in lunch or when they are outside or when they have free time, and when there in the class to not use it or to just turn it off or if they don't want to respect what the teachers telling them to take it away and to tell them to come there mom and to pick it up or have the student to stay after school.

If it does not work like that to not allow the cell phones in school?
