The reason why I certainly beleive that this is a natural landform is because what it acually is reveiled to be is common on that planet. It is usuall to see stuff like that on that planet. That one just had shadows to make it look like a face.

"the face" just looks different from the other martian mesa's. Some can argue an say it could be lots of other things such as sign of life on mars or being made by aliens. But im sure that the scientist opinions are more likly to be true then some reporters opinion. The martian mesa explanation is way more reasonable then it was made by aliens. There are many things to back up that it is just a natural landform. What does anyone have to back up that aliens made it. Nothing supports that.

One thing that supporrts it being a natural landform is that in 1998 MGS flew over cydonia for the first time. The MOC team snapped a picture that was way more clear an easy to see then the ones the vikings took. It reveiled that it was not an alien monumeant it was just a natural landform.
