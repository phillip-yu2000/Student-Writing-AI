Do we need a Facial Action Coding System in our classrooms? I

agree, with using a Facial Acton Coding System in our classroom. The Facial Action Coding System could help teacher know what their students' emotions are, and if the students emotions are in negative mood or positive mood they can change their lessons so they are more interesting for the students. Not only could this help the teachers but, this may help the students be more engaged in the classroom and participate more duriung lessons when they need to. Classroom computers acn already dectect how a student is feeling by giving teh student a certain AD depending on their mood."A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored," Dr. Huang predicts(Paragraph 6). If you make a facial expression it not only shows how you are feeling, it can also help you produce your facial muscles. In conculsion, it woulcd be a great idea for teachers to use them in the classroom, and they probably put them in work areas so managers know how their emploees are feeling in their work area.
