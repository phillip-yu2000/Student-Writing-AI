Dear Principle,

I believe that students must participate in sports or any other activities no matter what grade they get. Sports helps the students' brains to become active. Without those activities, then your students would fail their classes. Not only does those activities help your students from failing their classes, but also letting them have fun and getting them active. Those sports and activities would also help the school to become fit and may give students a good future. When I say good future I mean that if a student likes to play this certain kind of sport, they would work hard into it and may lead them to getting a scholarship for their collage. To get a scholarship students would have to have an excellent grade on their studies and do good in sports as well. If you disable those activities from your students, then they may fail their classes and might not have the chance on giving them a good future.

Sincerely ,

Student
