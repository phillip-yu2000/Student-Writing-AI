The Face is not created by aliens but is a natural landform.

Many people may think that the aliens created it to show their is life on mars.

Sadly we have discovered that it was just a natural landform.

The face like I said was just a natural landeform.

In the text it says, "Thousands of anxious web surferes were waiting when the image first appeared on

JPL web site, revealing . . .a natural landform.

There was no alien monument after all."

On the webstie the image appeared just to be a landform that was not man-made.

The text also says, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a mutte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."

A scientist named with the last name of Garvin said, "Thats's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars."

These statistics in the last paragraph should show that this

Face was not created by aliens but are natural landforms.

To conclude the Face is, ". . .a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. . .".

Aliens may exist but the Face did not have anything to do with them.
