A lot of schools offer online classes, but is that really the best choice for student? No! Why, you might ask. Because students are not getting the hands on learning that most students need and also it would put a lot of teacher out of work. But that is only some of the reasons why online classes should not be offered to students.

Now your probably wondering why a student like me does not support online classes. Well one of the reason is that students will not get hands on learning like most students need. But why is it important. It is important because some student cannot focus at home like they can at school, also students will not retain the information they need cause they are not taking notes and doing work in class like they should.

Another reason why online classes should not be supported is it would put almost every teacher out of work. Teachers have to go through so much school to become a teacher, but with online classes all their hard work would have been for nothing. So why would we try to change things now when they have been working for years.

However some people still disagree due to recent events like corona. Well I am here to tell you that they are still wrong. The reason is that for many of years students have gone to school even with the threat of a new virus. So why should school get shut down now even though this has happened before.

In conclusion, schools should not offer online classes, even with the threat of the virus. Reasons being they will not get the hands on learning that most students need and also because it would put almost every teacher out of work. Therefore, students and teachers should still wake up every morning and go to school.Â
