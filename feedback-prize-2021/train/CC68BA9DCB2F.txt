Asking alot of people for advice is always a great idea. Since you don't know whether the advice is good or not, its better to listen to different opinions from different people, in order to make better decisions.

For example, in four year i'll be going to college.When i'm choosing which college to go to, I will ask several people for advice. I'll ask my mom and dad to see how much money we have. Asking them can help me choose college that are not so expensive. Then i'll ask my siblings what they did after high school. One of them is planning to attend SCHOOL_NAME soon, and he told me that is a really good college for studying law. From hearing that, I might add SCHOOL_NAME to my list. Finally I'll ask my counselor where I should go, since she knows what my strength are and what my weakness are. She can suggest which college suits me the best. Hearing those advice from different people can help me choose the best college to attend.

After I enrolled in college, I will ask my parents for advice. They told me in college, studying is way more important than socializing. They also warned me to be careful and surround myself with people that will bring positive change in my life. After hearing from them, I asked my friends what they would do. They told me they would party all night and drink alcohol. Comparing my parents advice with my friends, obviously, my parent's advice are much better. It's always better to ask more people than one so you don't make a mistake.

College means independent life, before graduating high school, ask more people for advice! Everyone have different opinions, choose which one is best and which one will help you the most!
