Dear principle i think that kid should do community service. It is a duty that kids should do for example pick up trash at the park or at the beach or help at homeless shelters or soup kitchens. Kids have plenty of energy and time to do community service. Some kids say they don't have the time but really they have time there just to lazy to do it.

I think that in high school students should at least a month of community service to pass to the next grade. It is important that they help out because if they don't the community well become more of a mess then it already is. So its all up to the student they can help out and live in a nice community or do noting and live in a ugly tagged up community. Its time that student start taking responsibly for them selves and take action and give a helping hand in the community.
