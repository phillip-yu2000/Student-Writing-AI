There are many people who have been through a lot in life. So it is smart to see other peoples opinons when you feel it is necesarry. The more people you talk to the more opinions you have to go off of for your choice. As you get more opinions you can narrow it down and see the different good opinions and bad opinions. I think that talking to more people for advice is a great idea.

People all over the world have experienced different things. So some people might feel very strongly on your topic, in that case they would be a great person for advice. It makes them a better option than some other people. Some people in this world have barely experienced anything so they wouldn't have a strong opinion.

The more advice you get the more you can narrow down your decission and be more confident with it. You may get some bad advice or opinions and you may get some good ones. But you must go through all of your advice and see which ones are good and the most supported.

By talking to more people you can make a pros and cons list of opinions. That will help you see the good and the bad. Somethings just aren't worth the risk but you have to figure out what those things are. Life can be hard but that's why you ask people that you know have been through it for advice. It's your job to know if things are worth it or not.

All in all, I think that asking other people for advice is a great thing to do. It can benefit you in so many ways and it could potentially save your life. But that depends on the situation you're in. But ask for advice and see where it leads you because there are a lot of people who will know more than you.
