Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should choose her first policy, allowing student to bring there cell phones to school as long as they are off during class. I like that idea because it gives students a chance to be free and it will help students relax more in school if they had more freedom. If students are always under some type of strict rules it causes more problems in the learning place. Policy 2 would cause the students to sneak and bring their phones. If they are caught with them most likely the teacher will stop the whole learning process just over a little phone but if they were allowed to use them during free time they wouldn't have to sneak and interupt the learning process. The student will be happy to come to school and feel a little free instead of feeling like they are prisoners. It will help everybody work better including the teachers. They won't have to worry about students not listening to them trying to text because they can just wait til their free time. This also allows teachers to relax and chill incase they need to talk on their phones. Now incase a student breaks the rule of policy 1 i think they should be punished not the whole school because it would cause a problem. The students would complain and no teacher wants to here that.
