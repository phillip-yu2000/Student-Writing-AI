Dear principal,

Students like i think kids should be required to do community service. As a student i feel that this could give back to the community. By all means school should cost money but i am thankful that it doesn't. An the community works hard for the students here. They do things like help donate to the school an sell our spirit wear in their stores.

This also will help the students learn how to do good deeds, because when you do good deeds it makes you feel good knowing that you helped someone. Taking initiative helps not you or someone else, it does something for everyone. Principal, these students are here to learn an when you learn something it will stay with you for the rest of your life. So please give them this knowledge, even if the kid was to mess up in life he/she may always remember that feeling of knowing they really helped someone so they might do again. This could impact there lives.

God wants us to do this, to help each other, we are all a family. We shouldn't just think for ourselves, we should think about how it will effect others around us. So please principal think about what this will do for everybody. thank you.
