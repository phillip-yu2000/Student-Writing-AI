I think that driverless cars could be a good thing or a bad thing, but I think that the pros out weigh the cons. First of all the numbers of deaths and car accidents would be derastically decreased. If all the cars were automated you would have no human emotions getting in the way of driving and there would be very few mistakes made on the road.

Driverless cars are becoming safer and safer over the years. The article states that Google has had cars that could drive independendtly under specific conditions since 2009. It is now seven years since that point and the reliability and the safety of driverless cars has gone up. If we have driverless cars the roads would be much safer. There are some people that are driving to and from work very early or very late at night. Withought a doubt these people are suffering from sleep deprivation. These people have a higher chance of having a car accident then the rest of the poppulation. If cars were driverless then these people would not have to worry about driving. In later years, as technology advances, they might have the oppurtunity to relax and maybe sleep on the car ride home or to work.

Because of these arguments I think that driverless cars are a very real possibility. I think that people underestimate the power of the computer and what it can do. I would have more trust in a highly inteligent computer to drive me somewhere then a taxi driver. As long as technology continues to progress and evolve I think that within a few years there will be a few driverless cars in the mix with our normal traffic.
