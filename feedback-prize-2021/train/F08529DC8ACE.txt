Have you ever wondered why someone asks you for advice and then goes and asks more people? They ask multiple people because they want to know what more then one person thinks. Asking more then one person can better or worsen your decision. Someone people could give you bad advice because they want to see you fail or take something of yours and some could give you good advice because they want to see you succeed. I think it is better to ask multiple people and decide whos advice to take.

If multiple people tell me to do one thing I would think thats the better option and I would choose that. Everyone is different some people may not ask multiple people and make the right or wrong decision. For example the other day my father called me. Keep in mind my parents are divorced. He called and asked if he should put in for a position in Colombia with the U.S government. My father had asked multiple people me being one of those people. Some of the people said not to put in and some said to put in. I told him to put in and so did most of the people he had asked so he put in. Asking more then just one person for advice can great fully influence there decision.

What you are to the person also influences there decision. For example if a girl asks her mom for advice she is going to most likely take her moms advice opposed to her friends advice. Many thing can influence a decision but when it comes down to the matter of the fact you have to make the decision its all up to you. You can take the advice if you think its good advice or you can leave it. It all comes down to you. You should also know who to ask. Some people have better judgment then others.

This is why people ask multiple people for advice so they can make a good decision and not one they will regret.
