In the article, the author suggests studying Venus is, despite the dangers, a worthy pursuit. The author supports the idea of studying venus more by explaining how beneficial it would be to people for them to know more about another planet.

As said in paragraph eight, the author states that human curiosity will lead to "imagination and innovation". The author has already explained in paragraphs five to seven NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is already creating possible solutions for how to be able to learn more about the planet that involves either machines or people. One example is allowing scientists to float above the planet but still be able to study it from afar so they will have a lower chance of being harmed or injured during the travel. Another solution would involve innovation so machines could last longer on the planet's surface so the machines would be able to contibute to more knowledge of the plant.

It is true that Venus is a worthy pursuit. It is difficult, almost impossible, to reach Venus and gain more information than what is already known. Therefore, to be able to develop a machine that can last much longer than a few hours after landing, or to be able to send scientist to Venus safely without incident or injury, it would be a great accomplishment.
