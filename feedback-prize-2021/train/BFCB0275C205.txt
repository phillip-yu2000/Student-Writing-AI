The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, because in the reading, in paragraphs 2,3, and 4, talk about how Venus is relateable to Earth and that Venus is right next to Earth. In paragraph 2, it talks about how the density and heat of Venus and how there were some spacecrafts that have been sent to Venus, but have only lasted for a short-time. "Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours." (paragraph 2, sentence 5.

In paragraph 3, it talks about how the heat is so intense that in the third sentence it states, "On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince in our own planet."

In paragraph 4, they relate how Earth is similar to Venus, and how they thought that maybe Venus was our long, long, long, time ago planet. In sentnce 2,3, and 4, state this, "Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once havee been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."

So with all of this being said, I personally feel that Venus is worthy to study on, and who knows, maybe in our future lives, we may even have some type of opportunity to go and have a visit. All of this really fascinating because I didn't know that Venus is really hot. Even if Venus is dangerous is some way or another, those dangers will go away soon and to give NASA a chance to actually land on Venus. The reason I also personally think it's a great idea to keep on studying Venus, is because at some point in the future, plants or stars, or something will disappear and this might be the only opportunity we have.
