Did you ever wonder what getting sea sick feels like? Well in this prompt I going to talk about a guy named Luke who wants to covince people to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Well I think people shouldn't join the Seagoing Cowboys Program because of getting sea sick, maybe getting lost, or even dying.

First, getting sea sick. People who get sea sick probaly die of the disease or even get really sick. I can infer this is the number one reason for not going on boats people came up with.

Secondly, maybe getting lost in the ocean. Lots of people had this problem before but maybe not today. People can die or even just end up somewhere away from their families at home awaiting for their arrival. I can infer this happend alot to people who forgot which way to go to land.

Last, dying. This has happend because of either disease faling off the ship and being stranded or even starvation or drought. Another reason is because of other people attacking them. I can infer this happened often to people who did not pay attention to where they were going or to anything

To conclude this essay I'm going to list the three main reasons I thought not to join the Seagoing Cowboys program one getting sea sick, secondly getting lost, or even dying. Would you still join this program after you read this paper?
