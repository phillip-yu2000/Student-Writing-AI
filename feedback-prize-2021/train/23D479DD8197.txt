When you are seeking advice, it is best to seek multiple people's opinions, rather than ask just one person for their opinion.

Before you go and make a bad choice and do something that you're not certain of, it is best to get multiple opinions onÂ it, because some people may have very good advice that may help you make better choices. For example, if you decide that you want to swim with sharks, you're not just gonna go and look for some sharks then swim with them, you're gonna want to seek advice from multiple people that have expertise with sea animals, so that you have knowledge and you dont get eaten by sharks.

When you are applying to a school, you want to ask multiple people that have went ,and if multiple people advise you not to go to that school, then you know not to apply for it, but if multiple people give you good opinions on the school then you know that you should apply there. Applying for schools can be a tough thing, that is why you want to seek multiple peoples advice so that you have knowledge of the pros and cons of the school you are looking to apply for.

When you are seeking advice from only one person they may give you unhelpful advise, but if you ask multiple people, one person may give you unhelpful advise but the rest of the advise that you received may be very helpful, that is why it is good to seek advise from multiple people and not just one. Going to one person for advise can be a good thing sometimes, for example if you want to know something you can go to someone that you trust and they can give you the advice that you need.

Asking multiple people for advice is the best way, in my opinion, to get help with choices that you are not sure if you should make or not, but if you are seeking advice from one person, then you should ask someone you trust for advice, otherwise it is best to seek mutiple opinions.
