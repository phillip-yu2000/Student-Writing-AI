Dear Principle,

This certainly is a problem. Students getting it in their heads that helping others, and helping our community isn't important! Frankly I am astonished that my peers, my friends are against helping people and their surroundings. Of course they should help! It's benefits the people who they are helping , the world around them, and it keeps the school clean!

To start with, we who work with people in programs such as tutoring, are helping people who need help! People who need tutoring greatly appreciate the help they are given! Not only does this help their sense of pride and accomplishments, it enables then to have a better future, and a better life. Also, I know when I help somebody I get a feeling of pride and I feel happy knowing that I made a difference in that persons well being and in this case their education. Don't we want that kind of feeling for our school?

Secondly, This kind of program could help the person who is helping grade. You could count this as a grade in a certain class or their homerooms. It could also be simply just extra credit. Not only would this make the people who participated become proud of themselves and the grades, their parents would also be proud of their growing grades, and of the school. The would be proud to say, "My child makes good grades because they help people and their school out." This would bring people flocking to our school.

Lastly, If we are cleaning up the school, visitors the are looking at and rating our school will see a clean school, where students are proud to be and learn. This could bring sponsors, and money to our school. With more money we could get supplies for our programs, our build a high school. Which, we know we benefit you, and us students.

So you see students shoul be required to participate
