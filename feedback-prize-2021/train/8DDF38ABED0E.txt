I remember when I was a younger and started doing an extracurricular activity after school. It helped me from just going home and being a couch potato to being a great athlete now.Â In my opinion, students should have to do an extracurricular activity because it can help with obesity, you can learn from it, and it can encourage other students to do the same.

One way an extracurricular activity can be helpful is helping with obesity. Some people just go home and sit and eat the rest of the day. It even could be that they go home and just play video games. If you do an extracurricular activity then it can help with not gaining so much weight.

Another way extracurricular activities can be helpful is that you can learn something new. Say that you're in a math club and you don't know a whole lot. Well maybe someone who is in that same club knows way more than you do. So you ask them for help and they start to study with you. You get smarter and later you will be teaching other kids who were just like you.

The third way that an extracurricular activity can help is encouraging other people. If you have a friend group and you all just play video games, maybe try something else like a sport. You will go to that activity and your friends will question you. That activity then makes you an even better person than before. Soon your friends will want to try it and they become better people as well.

This is why in my opinion, I think that doing an extracurricular can help with obesity, you can learn something new, and can encourage other students to do the same.
