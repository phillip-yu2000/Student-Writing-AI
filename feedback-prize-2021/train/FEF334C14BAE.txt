Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? It's almost like a science-fiction novel. This mesa found on Mars has theories going in two directions. Was it created by aliens, or is it a natural landform? Both are possible, but only one is probable. The media can lead you to believe information that might not be true. Like in this situation, the "Face on Mars" that is said to be bona fide evidence of alien life, but it is proven to be just a natural landform.

Forty years ago, when the "face" was first revealed, it seemed very likely that it was not made by nature. The search for alien life and all the money put into NASA's programs made people believe what they wanted to hear. As time went on, and new technology was put into effect, the images of the mesa became clearer. In the early 2000's, it was made clear that the mysterious "face" was just an illusion. One can tell from the images of the "Face on Mars" that the mesa can appear to look like a face when out of focus. Alien life on Mars has not been proven either, so without evidence of life, we can't assume that the "face" was not created by nature.

It is possible that the mesa appeared as a face because of the dept perception and shadows. In reality, the landform barely looks like a face at all. In the most recent photo, the small details on the mesa almost look like the rivers we have here on Earth. The mesa is even compared to landforms that are found on Earth, as stated in the article. Since there is no proof of the "face" being alien-made, the only conclusion left is that it is a natural landform.
