What if the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can help students get better grades?

I think the new software that has been developed, can improve the grades/ learning of students.

The Facial Action Coding System has lots of great reasons to why it's valuable for students in a classroom.

I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

Why, because if the students had the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) the teachers would be able to see if the student's are focusing/paying attention to what it is that they are doing.

The teacher's would be able to tell what's wrong with the student.

The student's emotions would show on the system.

I think it's a good idea, now the teacher's can read student's emotional expressions.

If the student is not getting good grades, the teacher will be able to see what it is that the student is feeling.

When the student's are feeling confused, the teacher will know.

Some student's are shy to raise their hand or even ask for help on what they are confused on or about.

" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored".

Reading the students emotional expressions, would be a specific result with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System).

Maybe you could tell hows your friend is feeling by looking at them.

But, the system would tell you their exact emotions.

Being able to see how you feel is a great for teachers.

So yes, I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valueable.
