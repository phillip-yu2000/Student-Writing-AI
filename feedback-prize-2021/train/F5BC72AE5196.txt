Dear principle,

I believe community service is very important. I feel that it should be required in all states because when you are applying for college they like to see how hard you work in and out of school. Not only are they wanting to see how you're good grades they also want to see if you are trying to make your community a better place. Where I'm from in the 12th grade they have senior projects. Some people use that as a time to do community service but i believe they should start even before that like they're first year of high school like picking up litter and helping the less fortunate. Giving time to someone younger than you. You could actually end up helping them succeed in life , maybe they just needed that little extra push to help them follow there dreams in life. So community service could actually be 2 wins for everybody. The person giving back can get into a better college with community service and the person they helped would have a better look at things then they did before.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME
