I have 5 honors classes 3 classes 12 hours of homework and in still required to do a extra circular. I do not actually y have that much work but it feels like it and my principal is adding an extracurricular onto it i disagree with this decision because i makes school too hard for the students it gives the principal teachers and school staff more control over the students life and students might not have enough money to do it

Certain students in the classroom like to get extra credit for college or high school that requires a lot of harder questions increased hours of homework and bigger vocabulary these students some students are overwhelmed as it is adding an extra activity would limit their school work and stretch them thin.

When a student is at school the principal the teachers control what they are allowed to do and where they allowed to do it for 7 hours Monday through Friday. The Students Need some time away from the school. a lot of kids do not even like coming to school if they had another activity forced on them by the school they would skip more. The students wont like to have thing crammed into their schedule by school staff.

Not everyone has same amount of money some people have rich parents some people have poor parents everyone wishes that they had the richest parent but they are just doing their best. Some kids are forced to do thing they dont want to because they dont have enough money to do what they want like i wanted to play hockey with old bu i cant cause i am not rich enough but someone whos even poorer than me is super limited to his extracurricular activities and they will spend hours doing something they dont like

For those reasons i disagree with the principals idea to make extracurricular activities mandatory. I think this idea Hurts certain children and stuns their growth as individuals.
