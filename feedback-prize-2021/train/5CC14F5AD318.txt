Dear state senator,

I have come to a conclusion that I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. I think if we kept the Electoral college and we voted for this person and he went against us and chose the wrong person for president we would be out of luck. Voting ourselves for the president of the United States would be the best for everyone. No one would get confused on who they want to vote for or wo they want to win the election. In my opinion its just best that way. as they say in source 2 "can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always." If you cant control whom your voting for as the president it makes no sense to even vote. That's like saying im voting for no reason. For example in the Electoral College you aren't voting for the president your'e voting for the electors who then votes for the presidet. If you dont know who the elector is going to vote for how do you know to vote for that elector, let's say you do know and they change their mind and go against you. You cant do anything about it but hope for the best. I say get rid of the Electoral college and let voters vote who they want to be the president of the United States.
