Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing to you under the concern of your choice to either make all students do community work. A few of my friends do community work outside of school, and some do not. I personally think it is their choice to do community work or not. Some may think it takes up time, and some may not, but I think that it should not be a mandatory option. I would like to do community work, but I would hate for it to be a job we have to do. I think that there is no use to it, if we are made to do the job. We would enjoy it regardless for helping the community, but personally if your asking me, we would actually be putting heart into it, if we chose to. You could make it to where we had three community service jobs, in two weeks time. Everyone should do community service in their lifetime, but I think it should be their choice when they do it, and why they do it. You should at least ask the opinions of students besides me, about the situation. So you could get an idea of which direction you should take. Don't get me wrong, this decision is all your choice, since you are the principal of the school, but I am just giving you my input of your idea. SCHOOL_NAME already have community service hours, ask yourself, should students outside of SCHOOL_NAME have to do it? well if your answer is yes, then just not make it troublesome of others. I am sure that other students would feel the same way about my idea, and have the same opinion as I do. It should be a well thought manner in your case. So my idea is yes, community service, but don't make it mandatory. I just would take some advice from others, and see what they might think.

Thank You for your concern.

Sincerely, anonymous
