The automotive technology today is very complex as far as the car flexibility and technology within it that makes it smart. This includes its self parking and driving abilities that makes it almost driverless. But how much 'driverless'? there are many factors of a driverless car that our current cars posses, but really there would need to be better technology for a truely 'driverless car'.

Driverless cars are in the near future, but not as it is portrayed. The smart roads are too expensive and too massive of an upgrade on our roads now. the smarter cars still need human driving in cases of smarter maneuvering, like around accidents and such, that the smartest of the car couldnt do itself.

A 'mostly' driverless car is more reasonable. With the technology we have cars are virtually almost driverless, but the driver, hence it needs a driver, needs to be alert and take over when its needed, like maneuvering around things noit programmed to function around in the car, that needs '[smarts' more that the technology has.

Driverless cars would need a self-aware technology that no technology we currently have posseses. The smart cars would have ti have far more complex programming. The sensors in driving assisting only go as far as assisting in maneuvering in congested traffit and parking. There is also an alert system of object or another car collition, self braking, which is a large aspect of an driverless car.

Perhaps there is a change in the destination path of a driverless car. it would need to be able to change its course, but in many instances like a blockage oir accident it would eed programming to move through or around it, that only the human driver can posses the knowledge of doing. What would the car do if another car collided with it and damage it if the car opperaqted itself?

Nearly driverless cars are in the future, but i dont believe we will create the technology to have a virtually driverless car.
