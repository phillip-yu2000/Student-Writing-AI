I think students being able to take classes from home is a great tool to continue to facilitate learning. Being able to take classes at home through videi or just online helps make sure all students have a chance to succeed. There are nany reasons that a student would have miss school,that shouldn't stop them from getting their education if possible.

Many students face illnesses or medical implications that don't allow them to go to school regulary. Whether that be a disease or even teen pregnancy. With the option of online school, you open door to students who would be failing otherwise. I think students would benefit from having the online option. Not only does it help students not get behind, it also ensure that they still college even if they can't physically attend class.

The option of online school is nothing but benefical. in Generic_City many students take online school and it helps them graduate on time if not early. It is very import that students complete their high school education and online school makes that happen for many students who wouldn't have other wise.
