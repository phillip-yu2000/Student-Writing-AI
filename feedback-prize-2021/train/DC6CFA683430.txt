Being a Seagoing Cowboy is awesome. When your over sea, you can do all kinds of stuff. You can feed the horses, clean the stalls, and when all the horses are dropped off you can have some fun. Basicly, you can anything you want. I think you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

When the horses are around it's a pretty easy job. All you have to do is feed them, water them, and clean the stalls. Simple. You feed the horses hay and oats. Give them fresh water and clear their stalls every 1 or 2 weeks. It's a pretty easy job if you grew up on a farm.

Being on a boat, we have to make stops along the way. That is when you can go sight-seeing. On our last trip we were going to Greese, we stopped at Venice, Italy. I saw all kinds of cool stuff. I took a grandola ride down the streets of water.

But when all the work is done, and we are all on our way back to America, that is when the fun begins. The other cowboys and I do all kinds of stuff. We play baseball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games to pass time. Sometimes we even play volleyball in the empty horse stalls. Its a lot of fun being a Seagoing Cowboy.

With big orders for horses it might be hard but there are some small orders which are real easy. All in all, it is a fun job. Sometimes the trip is long, somtimes the trip is short but it is still the greatest job in the world. I think no job could be any better. You should come and join to be a Seagoing Cowboy.
