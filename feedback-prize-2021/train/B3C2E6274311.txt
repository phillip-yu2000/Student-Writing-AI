I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good software improvement because people don't always tell whats going on with their life, even if sombody ask them what is wrong with them, they just don't want to talk about it.

This new software will make things more easier for people who try to determine wether the person is happy, mad, disgusted, sad or disappointment. But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe she never talk about how she felt when the picture was took and people just say she was happy and she wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.
