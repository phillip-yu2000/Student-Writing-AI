Dear principal,

I would like to recommend you to allow students to bring cell phones to school and only use them during, lunch or other free periods as long as the phone are turned off during, class time because this will give the students an opportunity to use it in case of emergency or if they don't feel so well. In addition, cell phones aren't bad things to have around they are actually good to have because that why when anybody doesn't have a phone then maybe someone else does and there would be no reason to ask a teacher for use of there classroom phone. I know that the students tend to use it during class, but it might be because they forgot something at home like for example there homework or gym clothes. Even if you try to ban cell phones students won't obey and they will bring them anyway, unless you confiscate it.

In my opinion you should let us the students bring cell phones to school, and let us be responsible for losing it or breaking it. Besides even some teachers bring cell phones and they sometimes use it when the students are busy doing work or when they are at there break time. I think policy 1 is the a better than policy 2 because it gives students a chance to use there cell phones as long as it is during lunch or other free periods. Making the students not having to hide them away from teachers or principals or anybody would make them use it without being afraid that someone might take it away from them as long as they only use it for free periods or lunch time and only if the cell phones are turned off during, class.
