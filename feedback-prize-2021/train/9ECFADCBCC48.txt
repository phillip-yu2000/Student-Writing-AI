I believe we should continue in the making of autonomous cars. There is much to be discovered on it as well as much to be put into it. I would be very careful if I drove one yes, but I do believe the car is capable of what they need and whatthe people need. Yes it will still need human assistnce once in a while during the times of "...navigating through road work or accidents." Which will keep the ddriver still in control and not putting others and themselves in danger. As said in the text "The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepaired to take over." This may become a problem seeing as most people think that if a car is auto-drive then it needs no human-asscistance and they may just leave it be and let it do it's thing. They decided that to make it easy to tell the driver " Hey, you should help me drive." To help with this they put in a vibrating chair to vtell the driver that they should take over. Itis said in the text that some states will welcome these cars once proven safe. This is why I believe they should continue their work. They have things to discover and things to apply to it. They will correct any mistakes and learn what needs to be done. I believe that these cars will one day be perfected and "driven".
