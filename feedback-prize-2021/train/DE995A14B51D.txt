Many schools have all sorts of extracurricular activities

,

but there are still students who don't participate in any

.

Although teachers try so hard to push students into these activities

,

some just don't want to or can't

.

My principal has made a rule saying that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular

,

and this rule is completely unjust

.

The principal should not be allowed to force students into participating when they don't want or need to

.

The word extracurricular has 'extra' in it for a reason

.

Students can choose to

,

but don't have to participate in them

.

If a student doesn't want to be in any of the extracurriculars the school offers

,

the principal has no right to force the student to do it anyway

.

Extracurriculars are not mandatory

,

and therefore shouldn't be forced onto the students

.

For some students

,

it's not that they don't want to participate

,

it's that they can't

.

Many students have jobs and other responsibilities to take care of after they get out of school

.

They have siblings

,

pets and themselves to take care of

.

The students who don't join any extracurriculars might have other things they need to do with their time out of school and the principal shouldn't take it away

.

I highly disagree with my principals decision

,

because students either don't want to or don't have the time to participate

.

Students shouldn't be forced to do something they didnt choose to do

.

It is not up to the principal what students do out of school because at that time the school is not responsible of them anymore

.

Students can choose for themselves whether or not to be in a extracurricular activity

.
