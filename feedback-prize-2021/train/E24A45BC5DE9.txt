The author had a really good idea of exploring Venus. The ideas he gave is that it would be a risk to get someone onto venus the probblem with that is no aircraft have surive landing, the planet it is way to hot to even get to the surfis of the ground. The temputer of the planet is. 800 degress fahrenhit that is very hot thats pass blowling point. The planet has 97% carbon dioxide. Venus has colds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The pressure on Venus is like the ocen if you go way to far down you get crushed.

The people see this as a chellange to get to venus there are alot of dangers so not alot of people can get on the planet well not even one aircraft has handled down on to venus so that would make it even harder for a person to land down on Venus.
