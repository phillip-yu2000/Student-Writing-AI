DoÂ you really think student are going to learn just sitting on their vidoeo game? The issue that the studenrs are going to come across is that they are not getting the help they need and they are not even smart enough. Stiudents studying at home is not something that should be allowed anywhere, although yes school is boring and there is nothing to do, but we should be blessed to have a free public school.

Other places around the world parents/gardians have to pay so much money that it is just redicouls and the majority of students don't go to school because they don't have the funds for it.

Home school should not be around, because the students are taking the bafit of the home and most of the home school student don't graduate or finish high school because they are too busy being home doing all the unimportant things when they should be in school getting work done and hopefully graduating. In case students do take the online schooling they should at least have someone monter them and see the progress they have done every wee or two, this way it is going to lower the mount for students that don't graduate.
