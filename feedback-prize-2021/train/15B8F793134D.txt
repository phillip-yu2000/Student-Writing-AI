Can this technoloy really be valuable in a classroom? I'm sure it can. This technoloy can help the teachers understand the students more. With this we can make the students understand the lecture more, helping the teachers come up with a more understanding lesson." The facial expressions for each emotion are univesal",said Dr. Huang. I put this quote , beacuse i think is says a lot about human emotion, we all have different was of showing how we feel indiviually and with this technoloy it can hep with understanding each other.

Understanding how teenager feels is hard even for parents ,so how can teachers how students feel. A lot of us teenagers sometimes lie about how we feel or if we understand your lesson plan, but with Facial action Coding System teachers can see how we feel about all of theses new things were learning. This is an effective way teachers can see if we feel sad and bored. Even with a fake smile teacers can see if your telling the truth. Yes, every student isnt the same , but I think having this technoloy thats how can understand what each studnets need to help out every student.

" A classroom computer coukd reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored", I put this here because this is a statement. This is something humans lack in, understand human emotions. FACS can really help people consulers, teachers, and nurses. Us students sometimes dont know how we feel , we dont always know how to put it words , so with technoloy it help us have a liitle more of and understanding in how to show and say how were feeling. As a student I do think this technoloy can help improve classrooms and teahcers.
