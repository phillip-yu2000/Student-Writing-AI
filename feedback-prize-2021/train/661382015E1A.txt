Phones & Driving

Although cell phones haven't been around for the longest time, they have become an essential part of our lives. Cars and other vehicles have become great assets in daily life as well. Combining the two, however, is a terrible idea. Texting and driving is extremely dangerous, and leads to nearly a million and a half crashes per year. It switches the focus from the road to your hand, and makes you a weapon, capable of easily ending someone's life. Texting and driving is a product of this generation because it takes your attention off the road, is caused by a lack of responsibility, and causes a forth of all car accidents per year.

The teenage generation causes a large majority of accidents due to their lesser experience, but also because of their addiction to social media. They are easily absorbed into their phones, unable to realize that a truck is turning into you. One moment, your texting your best friend about kittens, the next your bones are broken, and you hang from the floor, your car upside down at the bottom of a hill.

This extremely deadly situation has a very easy solution; put the device in your pocket!

However, the temptation to do otherwise leads to those situations. Sometimes it's not their fault, though. Some teens aren't taught how to be responsible with their electronics, and later in life, their eyes are still glued to that screen. They then have to learn the hard way, by wrecking. That's why we should teach the younger generation about safety, texting and driving, and to pay attention to the road.
