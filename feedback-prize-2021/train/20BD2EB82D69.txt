I think we should get rid of electoral college because its not fair that some of  the larger  sates get more votes than the little states and its also not fair that some states are a win and take all state, it also dosent make sence that if you are winning the popular vote you still have possibality that you could lose the campagin. the other the thiing with electoral collage it can a tie the house of represntative gets to pick and they aare most likely to vote for the vice presidant. On paragraph 13 it says that "the electoral college is still un fair to voters because of all the winner takes all system" so that would hurt the chance of the person running there campaign there because they know there not gonna have achance winning that state so they dont even try to campaign there, also on paragrahph 23 it says that "voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preferance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election" i also think the way of electoral votes is an outdated methothed of voting and should let the people have more power and actually count for the person they want to win.
