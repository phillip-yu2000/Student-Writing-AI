Dear, Generic_School.

For some of the students, school is really far away for them, some student arent able to be in school for there health issues or gifted youngsters, is a really wonderful thing that the schools are offering online classes for the kids, it can really be a big help for there parents and there children.

My aunt, she has two children and one of them is gifted she can't walk normally, my aunt works everyday and is really frustrated , she has to take her to school everyday in the morning and take her home in the afternoon, from there home to school is like a 30 minutes of a ride and the way back , there is no bus able to take her where she lives , during the winter she wasn't a fan of the cold, the kid mostly feel sick during winter season, during at that time every morning they go outside to the car so my aunt can drop her to school she always felt sick, she was not able to attend school normally, it is really hard for my aunt, i told my aunt about the offer that the school are gonna make, about the online school and she really supports that decision she told me " That would it be a wonderful thing for me and my child" she is really joyful about the offer that the schools are making,

I fully do support this offer, from the schools having online classes it does help a lot of kids and parents, with they struggles and timing at home, it will be a big help for the counties of Generic_City, we want all the kids to learn at same time so they can be prepare for there future.

Thank you for your time.
