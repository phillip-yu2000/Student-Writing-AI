The FACS computer can identify human emotions, by there facial expressions and showing the percentage of how happy, sad, mad, etc. they are. This system would work to read the emotional expressions in a classroom which is valuable so the teacher can know how they really feel instead of putting on a fake smile and saying there ok when they really aren't.

The evidence from the article is when the author states "A classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it will modify the lesson like a human instructor". Such a statement says that the computer of the classroom can be able to modify the lesson when a student is uninterested in the subject being taught; it also is saying that the lesson will be modified and make it a fun learning activity for the students to be interested in the subject taught and pass the subject being taken in class.

In conclusion, I agree that this technology is valuable for a classroom, beacuse when using the technology it will make the students learn in a fun way and pass the class instead of being bored or uninterested in the class being taught. This would be a better option to do instead of having kids fail the subject being taught. Making students interested in the subject is a better way to make them love learning and love school.
