Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to explain to you why I think it would be a good idea to make only people with B averages be allowed to play sports or activities.

Many students in our school have a C average. Which means that a lot of people in the school could not play any sports or activities. I understand your reasons for why you would like students who have a B average to participate and I strongly agree.

First, in my opinion, if you cannot get your homework in on time, how could you also have extra time to play a sport, non the less an activity. Some parents tell there children "school comes first."

I do not believe that you can put your full effort into a sport or activity if you cannot even get your homework in on time. I understand some people may have been gone a day or week but they will be excused and have extra time to do that assignment.

Next, you might be the kind of person who might not study, well, with this new school policy, more students might be encouraged to do so, and take some time out of there spare time and study which will help them out in the long run. Plus, this makes the children want it more, so, they might try harder.

As you can tell, I think that the new school policy is a great idea. With this rule, it will hopefully make students to be more responsible and focused. In addition, it's not incredibly hard to even get a B average. I am an A average student and it's not the end of the world if you study before a test or turn in your homework.

Sincerely your student, STUDENT_NAME
