Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I've heard the news and its been a disappointment to us all but i agree in this section of concern. However i believe with strong observation if a student is showing potential effort in their weak subjects they she be allowed to play an activity. Sports are a future preference in career sometimes and are highly devoted to. So if you were not to give students a chance in school it would be a chance that they would lack even more in their working habits. Also i understand the circumstances on how sports or other activities can distract the affect a child's well being when it comes down to school. Some children rely on what they love to do and while so they forget the most important task in the mist of it all. Their education. I believe you are right for stopping at the common grade to prevent further failure and from this certain point on students should be asked to focus their views on school work. After a week with limited sports and there is no change in the legal academic grade they should be removed from the active cycle. This method can come in handy when working with not only adults but children also. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
