In America cars are the number 1 means of transpertation they also making up for 50% of the polution in America. Using a walking tranzit instead would obviously be the easiest and most immediate solution to this problem, but what about the people who can't get where they need to go without it. This solution also could help America's obesity problem.

The practice of banning automobiles is obviously obserd, but is the easiest to tackle the growing obesity problem and pollution problem at the same time. On the border of sweden and Europe there is a close-nit community called Vauban and in this community there is a ban on vehicles. This pollutant free community and high density is essentially what we should be shooting for. The city/town needs to be built for this kind of transportation obviously you can't have the general store 12 miles away and not have an automobile to get there.

Cars are the most affordable means of automatic transportation it really is hard to the habit you have already forged over a century ago, But the fact remains thats why the air is so polluted and why kids are so fat tyhese days.

In America the natural use of automobiles is going down without the implication of any bans on automobiles. This is belived by sociologist in paragraph 34 to be because the decrease in employment and income of citizens in America.

European countries have set the stage for the automobile revolution it is only a matter of time until we stop letting cars own us. The atmosphere and money income will improve naturally,

Because we will spend less on cars and mind more to to Earth.
