Dear Principal,

I was informed that you have two choices about cell phone policy. I have read both and I have came to the conclusion you should chose policy 1.

Policy 1 is the better choice. Policy 1 gives permission to students to be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch periods but not in class time. Students need to be able to have their cell phones because maybe they need to call for a ride after school. If there is a fight and someone is hurt they can call the ambulance with their cell phones. Going to the office for a phone would take to long if the kid is seriously injured. Phones are a way communication we really are not doing anything wrong by having them. This is why policy one is the better choice.

Policy 2 states to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all. This is not a good choice because if this happens then students will be angered and sneak phones in anyways. Students will be using them in class because the teachers will not be able to see. You might say that kids will use their phones in class with policy 2 but if they have time to use their phones during passing periods then there will be no reason for them to use it in class. This is why policy 2 is the wrong choice.

Sincerely ,
