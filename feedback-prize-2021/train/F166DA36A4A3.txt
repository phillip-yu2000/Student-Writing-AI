In this essay im going to prove to you why that electorial colleges should be gotten rid of. i think that elections should be won by popular vote.

With Electorial Colleges what the public wants or voted for really just doesnt matter because if the majority of the Electorial College disagrees well then the majority vote is irrelevant to the election and the canidate that the Electorial College voted on will will the election. " The Electorial college is unfair, outdated, and irrational." I comepletely agree with that statement. the Electorial colleges are not dermocratic at all and when you vote for a presidential canidate well you're actually voting for a slate of electors. the Electorial College is also an unfair way to determine our president because well each state has a different number of Electorial College votes. Each state should have an equal amount of Electors to make it at least somewhat fair; its still unfair because of the fact that they can always out vote the popular vote from the citizens. when the Electorial College decides to out vote the actual winner that becomes problematic to the citizens because now a canidate that the majority of America didnt want to become president is now president and that can be problematic because the people may become angry or upset in some way because a canidate they felt didnt stand for a good cause or that was unfit to run the country is now in charge. also like what is the point of letting the people vote for who they want to become president if their vote may not even matter or make a difference because the Electorial College is going to do what they want anyways.
