When using technology to read students emotional expression you can expreience and read them wrong.

Using technology is a big thing in the world right now and alot of people go to technology or the internet for answers but when you use technology you can experience malunfunctions and wrong answers, so to read a student emotional expression you may read them wrong or get the wrong answer. Reading a student using technology can go many different ways you may get the right answer or you may get the wrong answer,but you can not calculate how a student feel based on a computer and facial muscles. Someone can feel angry and depressed and the computer can read them wrong. You dont have to use technology for everything you can do other things such as ask the person how they feel or look at their facial expression instead of hooking them up to technology in paragraph 5 it says "you can tell how a friend feel simply by the look on their face". The computer may say one thing but the person may feel another. This creation may work on some people but not all,in paragraph 5 it says"in fact,we humans perform this same impressive calculation everyday" even though it calculate all face expressions do not mean that person is feeling that way, a person can be mad for a few minutes or for a act then the computer will say overall that you are angry but you are really happy. In paragraph "eckman has classified six basic emotions and then associated each with characteristics movents of the facial muscles" . In conclusion, you sould not use technology to see how they feel when you can ask them and we should not have to use technology for everything when its right in front of you ,technology is taking over the way people feel towards things and people and you should not use it for someone emotional facial expressions.
