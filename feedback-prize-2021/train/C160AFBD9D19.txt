I was informed that we at least need to have a grade B average in all of are class to participate in sports or other activities but most of the students have a grade C average. Is there some way you can change it. If you don't change it many students will be disappointed. Many students already told me that their parents are thinking of calling and unless you want to be getting phone calls all day by mad parents I would say you should change it. For many students sports and after school activities is what keeps them out of trouble. Also parents sometimes can't pick up there child/children after school and this gives parents time to pick them up and something for their child to do after school. Its another way student interact with each other. Most students become friends by doing stuff they have in common. This is a good way for students to try and get there grades up but for some students school is hard for them.
