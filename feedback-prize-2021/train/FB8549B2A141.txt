Dear principal,

I think that all students should be required to do community service . Now in days kids think it's just all about them and they don't really care about our world we live in. Community service is also good for us because when we apply for college it will look good on us. The more extra things that you did for someone else than yourself the more they will want you in their school. They would say we would be really lucky to have that kid in our school. Kids can help out and have a life at the same time. They can do community service with their friends or they can do community service one day and the other day hang out with friends . You don't have to stop being a kid. It also doesn't really hurt to help out or do something nice once in a while. We are living in this world so we have to keep it nice and clean . So i think everyone should give a little of their time and do community service.
