Safety Over Status

Do you use a cellphone while on the road? Then your moments away from possibly causing a tragedy. When driving in a vehicle a phone isn't needed. A cell phone is nothing but and distraction on the road, that could lead to catastrophes by mer seconds of a person looking down to check a notification, post, or whatever.

I believe we shouldn't have anyone cellular device in or visual area unless you are in a predicament where you need it to safe either your life or another person's. Phones should be used for that purpose and that purpose only there's no need to be updated with social media 24/7 when you could simple wait when your home. Would you rather check a tweet and run someone over on accident towards your destination or drive safely towards your destination without hitting a thing. All it takes is for everyone to ignore the rings and buzzes of their phone.
