I love to sail. Ive been sailing since I can remember, the first things I remember about sailing is my dad telling me stories about his boat. Ive always wanted to make him proud, I wanted to be the best sailor I can be. What I didnt know was the hard work involved. My dad taught me a lot of what he knew the problem was my dad didnt know everything even if I thought he did.

I tried my best to do great but I could only get so far on my own. At my sleep away camp I would work on improving my skills, I soon became friends with some of the sailing councilors. Many of them were from around the world. I would ask them for advice very frequently, I soon found out that there are hundreds of ways even to do one thing. I realized that you can do things in many ways, each time I asked for advice from someone new I would learn new ways of doing things.

Something I am very great full for is that I know so many different people I can turn to for advice. I realize if I only listened to one person I would never grow and have my own ideas. Next time I need to learn something I know to ask for advice from many of my peers.

After seeking lots of advice I have tried to form my own way of sailing. I believe that advice is something we should seek often. Sometimes we get scared or we dont understand something, the fact is that everyone has and we can help each other. Even though I am only fourteen I have learned that advice is the best way to grow as a person.
