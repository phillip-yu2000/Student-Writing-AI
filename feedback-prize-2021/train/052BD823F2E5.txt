In the article of Making Mona Lisa Smile, we are introduce to a new technonology that is scanning our face or something that seems like it is scanning our face to indentify our emotions. As explain in the article it shows that they had used it on Mona Lisa to figure out how happy see seems or how disgusted she felt, or even how angry she is. In the first paragraph it talks out the percentage of her happiness,fearful,anger,disgusted. " It shows that 83 percent she is happy, 9 percent she is disgusted, 6 percent that she is fearful, and 2 percent that she angry". We may never know that this might of been true since the face they scaned was a drawing of her and she is no longer with us but we can say its ture for now. Computers now in days can give errors or even shut down, they can even restart if not used right or overheat. That can prove that what they scan can't be ture.

Yes it would be awesome to scan faces but is it even worth to pay? like we already know how we feel everyday why should we have a coding system that should code the wrong information and makes us seem like we wasted our time and money. A other problem would be is it even safe? how does the FACS even work? I wounldn't pay money just to get hurt or even have marks on my face just to see my emotion. In the article it says it can "calulate our emotions like math homework" that to me seem to be cool because the computer is thinking like us and it's doing its hardest to get the percentage of our emotion. I'll say that the FACS is a good idea just that they should keep on working with their idea and learn their mistake or errors and work on them to make this a good thing to use and sale.
