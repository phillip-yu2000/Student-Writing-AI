Dear principle i strongly believe that students need to keep up with there grades to play sports but some of the students have a hard time getting there grade up to a B. All the students don't learn as fast as others do some take longer so their grades aren't that high i think its better just to keep a C average and higher to play sports. Then if there grades start to get bad they have to be removed of the sport that their playing.

That really motivates a student knowing that they have to keep up with their grades if they want to play a sport i know it motivated me everyday to pay attention in class and not full around with my friends it really changed who i am now i don't get introuble anymore. So changing the school policy is not good cause for some of the students its going to be hard to get that B. It makes us feel like we failed to accomplish are goal in being in a sport. Me as a student we love being in sports so we can have fun and to have good sportsmanship.

And if you change that school policy less students are going to be in sports so i believe its better how it is now. Some of the students will be disappointed if the policy changed i know i would be.
