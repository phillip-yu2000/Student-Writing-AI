Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Yes, I agree with your being of wanting to change the school policy. I think that you should have a B average to be in any activities at school. If you don't have a B average on your report card, you need to try to pull your grades up instead of worry about basketball or any other sports that you might play. The children that do have a C average or lower I would try to help them as much as I possibly could. If there grades still doesn't get any better then they just wouldn't be able to participate in any sports. If you was associated with any activities you will most likely be thinking about your big game that night than you are going to be thinking about your math homework that you have to do the same night. If you have a C average your guardian shouldn't let you play any sports anyways. I think that you shouldn't let your child participate in any activities because if I had a child I would be more concerned about them getting an education rather than them playing football or basketball.
