The era of personal mobile transportation may be coming to an end. Many cities all over the world have taken part in a "car-free day". Residents of an experimental suburb in Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to participate in a movement called "smart planning", a developing trend in Europe. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gases.

With countries all over the world taking part in the percentage of greenhouse gases in the air, it is vital we all unite to clear up the air for our future generations.

In Bogota, Columbia, people are ending their car-dependent lives and participating in events such as the "Day Without Cars". The goal of this event is to "promote alternative transportation and reduce smog," according to Andrew Selsky's article in the

Seattle Times.

Businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza stated: "It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,".

So what are the advantages of limiting car usage? According to Selsky's article, the city of Bogota, Columbia have replaced "uneven, pitted sidewalks" with "broad, smooth sidewalks"; "rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic"; "and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up". But what exactly does that mean for the world and our everyday lives?

"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way," according to Heidrun Walter from Vauban, Germany, featured in an article by Elisabeth Rosenthal in the

New York Times.

Citizens like Heidrun Walter may feel less tense and happier. Also, smog and traffic will be cut drastically if citizens gave up their car-dependent lives.

In a way our lives may be more simple and healthy if we walked, rode a bike, or even rollerbladed to school/work. The smog would clear up and our everyday lives would be greater than before.
