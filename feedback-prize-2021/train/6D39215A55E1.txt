Students would benefit if they were able to attend classes away from schools because not all students have the time to go to school and come back to their homes to get ready to go to important places they need to be at. Students need to attend places such as jobs, meetings, and appointments; most of the time they need to go back home to get what they need to get ready to attend those places. They can do that if they attend classes online or video conferencing at home. A good amount of students also don't feel comfortable working around other students or just people in general. Video online or video conferencing is a great way to solve these problems and make a lot of students life easier.

Online schools save students time because they don't have to ride a bus to and back from school everyday. A bus can sometimes take up to an hour to drop you off at your neighborhood. They can be home for as long as they need to if they use online schools. Some students benefit from video conferencing because they are able to speak to a teacher through their computer at home when they need help with a problem of some sort. Video conferencing stops the need for students to go to school and speak to a teacher in person about a problem they have. Online schools are able to relieve a lot of students from stress since they have more time for work they need to complete.

Online schools are the future because they are able to greatly benefit students from having to go from their home to school everyday knowing they need have a lot of work to do when they get back home. Students who use online schools are able to complete more tasks in less time, therefore they have more free time to enjoy the rest of their day. They don't have to wait till their bus takes them back home to do chores or homework they have. The future of online schools are greatly going to benefit students who deal with a lot of tasks in their daily life.
