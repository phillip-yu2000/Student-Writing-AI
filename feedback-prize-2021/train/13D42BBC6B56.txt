Benifits on Limiting Car usage

Cars are one of mans geat creations but they are great because they are eassy not because they are good. In hevy populated areas cars make up about 50% of the greenhouse gas. and in just europe family cars make up 12% of green house gas. Some cars are efficient more than others but those tend to be more coastly.

First, green house gasses are a big part of the reson for global warming. Green houses also affect th ozone which could help to prevent it. Paris band driving because of how many people drive it started creating a smog and if that gets thick enough it could affect your respitory system. people who drive in countries where it was band they will be fine.

caust is a big part of beeing enviornmentaly friendly. I have a truck and it only gets about 18mpg which isnt that bad but my friends mom has a prius that gets like 40mpg and it can switch over to electricity. Cars with good fuel efficiency generaly are more expencive.

If people who have bikes ride them to say dinner once a week insted of driving they will save an amence amount of money just from not buying gas. Gas was just up to about $4.00 a gallon but now its at an all time low but we dont know when it will go back up. There are a tn of people in this world that are over waight and just walking like one a week could help.

To sum it all up, if every body just hepled out when they can the world can be a better place and maybe people can live longer.
