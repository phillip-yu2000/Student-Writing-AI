i think that having self driving cars would help alot. there are so many wreacks in the states because some people just dont know how to drive right.

so if we was to invent and sell computerized cars it could stop us from having so many wreaks plus it would also cause us to drive way safer. for instance if your drunk and you have to get home you just sit in the car and it will drive for you since you cant do it yourself because your not in the right stae of mind.

there is also the thought of making better roads but when you think about it that would cost more then a fortune to do. one other reason im all for this invention is because you know that the people making these cars are gonna earn a tone of money so that means more people will be switching to the new car instead of their old one. before you know it there will be somthing new and even better in technology since we just keep getting smarter over the years. who knows we might be driving hover craft later on in a few years because alot can be learned.

although we would also have to make some new laws or change a few of them. like in the text it states that what if somone gets in a wreak in a smart car should the driver be blamed or the companies that sold the the car to that person beheld responcibale. there also still some improvements that have to be made before they can even start selling those cars .

those are the main reasons that i think making smarter cars is a great idea.
