Imagin that you are participating in more than one activity and you do not have time to focus on your other school work. Its better for students participate in one extracrricular activity because it help students them to consertrate on their other school work. Participating on one activity can also be entertainment , but some student thinks one activity is not enough for them. In my opinion, participating in one extracurricular activity is termenously and entertainment for students.

Frist, participating in one extracurriclar activity can help students on their others subjects or doing their other school work. For example, if students particpates in more than one activity they can not focus on their other subject like math, doing thier homeworks and studing for thier tests. In addtion for students to focus or particpate on thier other subject is better for them to participate in one activity.

Next, particpateing in one activity have a great impact on students. For example they can lrean new things and they can see how much distinguished are they on that activity. All activity are not easy some are diffcult and some of them are easy but we have to try our best.

Furthermore, students should particpate in one extracurriclar activity because they can complete their work on time. Another reason why is tremendously way for students to participate in one activity is it can help them to persuade a successful place in futuer.

For example students are lucky to have one extracurriclar activity in porfusly schools student have more than two activity which is not good for them they can not complete thier work on time because of so much school work.

I believe that participating in one extracrricual activity is a magnificent and better way for students.

participateing in one extracurriclar activity can help students to focuse on thier other school works. It also help students to participate on only one actiity for example like sports students can put all their focus on only one activity.

Its a great deal for students should to participate on one activity because they can complete thier work on time.Â
