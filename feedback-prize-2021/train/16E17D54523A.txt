dear principle

I have heard that your new rule was that students have to have a B average to play sports I disagree with this rule because first sports can keep kids healthy and not over weight secondly I believe that sports is a way to get students mind off of school.

The reason I think sports is should be a priority is because they keep you healthy and if kids are over weight they will probably be made fun of.

Secondly school may be overwhelming for some students and when they get home they just do more overwhelming homework so if they have sports to go to that would get there mind of school and get it refocused then they will be more prepared.

This is the reasons I think that in order to play spots you have to have a B average is the wrong rule to apply to our school.

thank you for your time
