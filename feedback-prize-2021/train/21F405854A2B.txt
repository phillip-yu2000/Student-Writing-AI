The Google cofounder Sergey Brin thinks that the genius idea of driverless cars will be around by the year of 2020. This would mean there would be less accidents if it is put out into the world when it working properly.

Driverless cars would cause less wrecks and be safer to pedestrians. If you were drinking you could put the driverless part of the car on so there wouldn't be a problem getting you home. Many accidents are caused by people that are tired, drunk, or under the influence of something. "Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers." This quote shows that alert drivers would be the best for our safety, but the drivers not alert or under the influence of something could cause serious damage to someone or something which is why the car should have a setting for the human to drive and one setting for the car to drive.

Driverless cars is a great idea and have some flaws at the moment buy in a couple of years it will run perfectly or close to perfect so it can keep people safe. This would cause less accidents in car related things.
