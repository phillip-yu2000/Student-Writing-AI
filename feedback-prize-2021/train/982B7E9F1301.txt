Dear Principal,

I have been notified that you are giving us two policies about cell phones.

I think that the policy that should be chosen should be "DO NOT ALLOW STUDENTS TO HAVE PHONES AT SCHOOL AT ALL." I know that three main reasons there should be cell phones at school is because of time, learning, and responsibility. Cell phones will be a major distraction on these things to students.

To start off with, time is a big thing in school. Be in school on time, don't be late and if there are any important days don't miss out. Cell phones will take time away from a students learning and education. It will also affect on the students grades. I'm sure a parent wouldn't want that to happen.

Secondly, the learning of students. These electronics we speak of is a big distraction to a students learning. Cell phones will take away what the students are trying to learn in school. Students aren't really suppose to be at school texting. They are suppose to be at school learning for their future.

Last but not least, I think phones should not be allowed in school because it will bring great responsibility in a students life. If the phone ever gets stolen, damaged, or anything happens to it they are going to have to be responsible with their own actions. They wont really have the right to blame anyone else because they made the wrong choices of bringing it to school.

I really hope that these reasons will prevent your opinion from cell phones. Once in a wile they could use it at school even though they are not allowed but the students have to bring responsibility within themselves. Other people may disagree with me but i think they should understand the consequences first.

Sincerely,

A students opinion
