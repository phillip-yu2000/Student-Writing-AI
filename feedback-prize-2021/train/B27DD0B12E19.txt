The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is smart and could be usefull but, it could also be a bad idea. Being able to know everything that the student is feeling can help teachers understand them more. If a student was in danger and didn't feel safe the teacher would know and be able to help them. Teachers will have to ask their students if its okay to read their emotions because peoples emotions are very personal.

A teacher being able to uderstand students through their emotion can help teachers know more about how to work with them. For example, in the article this is said by Dr. Huang "Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor". According to this part of the text computers know how to change a lesson based off your emotion. That means that teachers being able to know your emotion can do the same.

I also feel that this is invading someones personal space. If someone wanted you to know what was going on in their life and wanted you to know how they are feeling they will tell you. Thats why I think asking for the students permission is important before updating their technology. Another thing is why understand computers, in the passage this is said "developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate" but why? I dont think computers and humans need to communicate but, I do think humans need to communicate with other humans. I feel that you don't need technology to know how someone is feeling because you could just talk to them if you think something is wrong or if they arn't understanding the lesson that you are trying to teach them.
