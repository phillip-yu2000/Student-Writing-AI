If everybody limited car usage, the whole population would save a ton of money. Insead of having to pay for gas, we will be able to pay for more things to provide for ourseleves and our families. We would be able to buy more of what we want; clothes, shoes, food, drinks, housing, taxes. We would save so much money because we wouldnt have to pay for gas anymore.

We will be able to walk or bike to all of the stores, work-cites and recreation facilities. It will only take a couple of minutes to get where we would need to be. We wont have to use a highway or interstate to go to the mall or ball field. Also, we will be getting more exercise. By walking and bikinng, we arent sitting and being lazy. Instead, we will be healthy and active everyday.

If we cut car usage out, people wont have to worry about money. Nobody will be labeled as "poor" or "homeless." Everybody by then should have enough money to have a house, a job, food and money to pay the bills. Crime will then go down because nobody will have to rob or steal for foood, money, or posessions. Everybody will have enough money to get what they want, on top of the money they get from working.

Instead of spending money on cars, we can spend that on neccesities. We will be able to walk, bike or use the public transportation given to us. We would be better off without cars because there would be little to any deaths caused by automobiles. Nobody will have to be scared of dying or scared of not being able to make/have enough money.
