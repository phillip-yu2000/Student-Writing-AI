I oppose the idea of schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes,this is because not all students benefit from attending classes from home,and online.

Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. In some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance.

In conclusion, distance learning and it's method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.
