Dear Principal,

I think you should let kids have cell phones in school, because what if one of our parents wants us to come home because something happened to them, and their hurt and your the only person close to the house. Or your parent needs to tell you something about your school work and you won't know about it till you get home then you get into trouble because they were really important, and that was your last day to turn it in. Also it will help kids interact in different ways, and kids won't get yelled at so much for talking because they can text instead. With phones in school kids can take notes and won't run out of paper and have to disrupt the class to get more. Also they can help teachers see if someone's cheating because they can check their phone and see their texts. Then you'll get both kids who were cheating and the punishment will be fair. Also when they forget to write a note for one class one of their friends can text them what it was and they'll get full credit for what they needed to do.

Sincerely

The Students
