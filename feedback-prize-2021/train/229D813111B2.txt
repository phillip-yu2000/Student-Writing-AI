In this article the author explains what Venus is at first , next he/she explains the benefit of learning about it and then finally talks about the dangers and challenges that come with studying it. Venus or the "Evening Star" is a planet similar to earth in size and density and is even reffered as earths "Twin". Yet these to are two very different planets, for example Venus's atmosphere suffers from the "greenhouse effect" which causes its surface temperature to average around 800 degrees fahrenheit! It also supports no life at least that we know of to this point unlike Earth.

To study the "twin" of Earth we must first either put something on the surface of the planet or take pictures of the planet from right outside the planet. This is a problem because its so hot on the surface that it will melt our currant technology and with the greenhouse effect the atmosphee is to thick to take pictures through. This is obviously a problem for scientist who want to learn more about the planet Venus. If we do learn about Venus though it might benefit us tremendously because we will know how to prevent Earth from having the same problem Venus did that eventually destroyed the planet into what it is today.

In conclusion I think the Author of this article realizes the dangers of studying eath's "twin" Venus but ultimantly thinks that the positives outweigh the negitives on this one and I agree. If Venus at one point really was like earth and supported life we need to know what destroyed it to prevent us from rewriting history. I think that outweighs any danger or problem in the longrun and Im sure the author would agree with me based on his/her article. Scientist as I type this are working on a solution for problems such as the ones up above and I wouldnt be surprised if we learned a lot more anout Venus in these next couple of decades!
