Keep Your Eyes on the road

1 out of every 4 traffic crashes that occur in the United States are caused by cell phone usage. Each day 11 teens die from a result of texting and driving. Even AAA reveals that 94% of teens acknowledge that they know the dangers of texting and driving and 35% admit to doing it anyway. Should we be able to use our cell phones while operating a vehicle?

How can we drive for others when we won't drive from ourselves?

Teens between the ages 16 to 19 are more likely to be involved in a fatal car accident than any other age group. I think teens in that age group are afraid of missing out or (FOMO) basically the desire to stay connected with what others are doing at all times. A subconscious habit that causes drivers to feel the need to know what other people are doing constantly. Texting while being behind the wheel takes the drivers eyes off the road for 4.6 seconds which is the same amount of time it would take to travel the length of a football field.

We shouldn't be able to use cell phones while driving to protect us and others around us. It is many temptations when we are driving but we got to remember that we drive for others not ourselves. More than 1000 drivers are injured every day due to distracted drivers and we got to limit the distractions for drivers.

Texting while driving is illegal.

As of July 1st of 2018 Georgia Governor Nathan Deal passed a law prohibiting the use of a handheld phone while driving. The Hand free law first conviction is a fair $50 fine and 1 point assigned to their driver's license. Second conviction fine is a $100 and 2 points added to driver's license. You can receive jail time if you are a continuous offender. I do believe that the consequences of violating this law is fair and should be complied by.

In order to reduce preventable accidents, we have to be more cautious as drivers for others around us. That mean taking our eyes of the phones, and keeping our eyes on the road.
