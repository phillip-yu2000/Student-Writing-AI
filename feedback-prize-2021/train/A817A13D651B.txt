Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

As you know, you are changing the school policy to students needing at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities. What you may not know is many students here have a C average.

A C average is not bad at all! It's actually the average scored of an A-F grade scoring. So many students do an expected "good job" on their grades. It is sometimes hard, or very hard for students to raise one grade level, especially since the school year is half way over, the sports and activities are winding down leaving no time to do so.

In addition, our middle school is very small, so we need all the people we can get on our sports team or activities. Making the cut-off a C average will cut off half of the participants from joining and already on a team or in a school activity!

This will create a difficult problem for coaches, and club leaders to have a small population on their team or in their club.

I have a friend who actually has a C average and is hoping to make the track team for the 3rd year in a row. She is also hoping that high school coaches watch her track meets to get on a team in high school, or even her favorite high school Springstead! If you change the rule she will not be able to participate in her favorite sport, or get into a further more educational and athletic school than her zoned high school Central, averaging a D grade level. Changing this rule can change someone's life.

To end this letter, my argument is to keep the rule of students to have at least a

C average grade to participate in school activities or sports in which many students have. I hope you have acknowledged this letter and change the rule.

Sincerely,

8th grade student; STUDENT_NAME
