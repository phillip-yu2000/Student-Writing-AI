Technology can be good uses for a lot of things in life espiecally for emotional,mental,and physical reasons. Technology has came a long way for many years and it becomes better every single day. Some people think technology is a bad thing but it actually does a lot for people and different sitautions in life. Expression can increase your emotion just as simple as a smile or a quick laugh.

Using the Facial Action Coding System could help improve someones emotional state by quickly seeing what their emotions are and if they are feeling down you can give them a hug and increase their emotions. If the Facial Action Coding System was a real life tool we could see many changes in peoples behaviors as well. Having a good behavior can make a good impact on your life and also a good reputation. The world can be seen as a different place if we all have good behaviors and good emotions because people will be a lot respectful and mindful of other human beings.

If someone used the Facial Action Coding System on other artist's pictures they could see how they felt at the time during the picture. Back when Mona Lisa got her picture taken she could have expierenced many emotions and no one truly knew how she was feeling but now that there is technology people easily can tell how she truly felt. As of today many people are left in their feelings and they don't know how to talk about their problems so they just keep them inside. With the technology it would help a lot of people express their feelins without feeling embarassed or scared.
