Wow! Us humans now live in day where something can read our emtions, that is pretty cool. Having the "Facial Action Coding System" would be very nice to have in a classroom. That would make it easier for the staff of the school to know what students like.

The man that made this "Facial Action Coding System" was, Prof. Thomas Huang. Thomas Huang was working with Prof. Nicu Sebe. Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are trying to get a way for humans and computers to communicate. What Prof. Nicu Sebe and Prof. Thomas are doing can help students in school.

Now how it works is pretty cool. In the article it says, "The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face." This would help teachers read what emtion a student is giving during class.

How will this effect students and teachers. How would this help the teachers? The computer will scan the students face see if they are focusing in class or not. In the article says that the computer can read "action unit" which is, "Movement of one or more muscles." Telling if the student is focusing in class.

This idea of a computer reading someones face isn't that bad. It would help out students in the future.
