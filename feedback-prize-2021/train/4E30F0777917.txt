I think that we students should at least keep a c grade average on the report card. So that we can attend our sports more easily and more relaxing. To much work for someone may over work there brain, and that is called stressed. Stress can bring there grades down lower than ever.

It puts loads of pain suffering and difficulties for them. all together they will be crashing down and it will be hard for them to come back for while . Parents will be shocked and heart broken to.

So keeping the grade averages should stay a c. For at least ports. This would be a problem if any student was falling because of stress and nobody wants to fail because of that. Would you? Cause to me that is horrible seeing some one fail. Its like watching your country get bombed. Its sad you don't want to watch people fail cause of a sport or grades. You want to help. You think about it and tell me what you think.
