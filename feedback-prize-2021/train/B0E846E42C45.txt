In the passage "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because venus could possibly be a planet that once had life on it. Venus may have once been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.

The author states in Paragraph 4,

"Long Ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, like Earth." The author put this in the passage to explain why we should keep trying to explore Venus despite the dangers it presents. If we were to continue exploring Venus and there was life on the planet then we could possibly find out what killed the living things and how long they survived on venus and if something similar could happen to Earth.

The author also states in Paragraph 8, "Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors." The author put this in the passage to explain that if there was once life on Venus and whatever killed them could happen to us, so we need to explore Venus so we know what things to watch for so we don't end up like the forms of life possibly did on Venus.

The author sugests the idea "that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents" because we could possibly explore Venus but may not be to that level because there are still many things that need to be figured out before anyone can land on Venus and survive longer than a couple hours.
