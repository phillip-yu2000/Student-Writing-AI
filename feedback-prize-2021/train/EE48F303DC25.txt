To whomever it may concern,

To begin with, me myself would most definitely love to help others in the task of cleaning our community. If we don't clean our community who will? We must have some respect for our environment. Although we all want to do other things, we must first do what we have to do. Community service is our duty as a citizen and we must do what's right. This is the way I look at it and soon enough it would be the way you look at it as well.

First off as a community we are the only people that would care about our community. It is not as if some one from a different part of town would just come to us and clean our space for us. We must do it on our own. Our community is the one in which we grew up in and i refuse to just allow it to become a wasteland. No one else would care for our community the way we do, or at least the way we should anyway.

Secondly, our community as a whole is one of glory with a little respect, and just as much respect given to us from our community should be returned ten fold. There's no doubt in my mind that our little dumb of a community could be turned into the city of Babylon if not better. All we need to do is treat it with a little respect.

Finally, we could all get a little lazy at one point and I don't mind that, but its that kind of thinking that put us in the need of community service in the first place. Just as you do your chores at home you should do to your home community. It's only fair. The amount of energy a kid has should not go to waste with video games, television, and computers. It should be distributed to the work of our community, and that's all it takes.

Now you wold understand why a person would feel so strongly about something as simple as community service. If everyone felt as deeply as i feel about our community the world would be a better place.
