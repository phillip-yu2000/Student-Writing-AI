Dear Principal,

I think it should just be optional to do community service. I think it should be optional because some people really don't have the time or patience to do the community service. I think it should just be optional but give out 5 extra bonus points a week to anyone who did at least an hour of service work. that would be fair. Also instead of giving out detentions you could make that student do 30 minuets of community work. I think most of everyone would agree with my opinion because if people do the community work anyways and they have a low grade score, then this could really help the student and your schools reputation as a whole. The board of education would be very impressed by all of the community work getting done. And your school would be even better well known and it may help the school be in the top 10 best schools of the state. Thank you for listening.

Thank You,
