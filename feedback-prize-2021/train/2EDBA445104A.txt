My position on driverless cars is that i beleive they shouldn't be made. People are lazy enough as it is. Driving cars isn't a difficult tast to do and the last thing we need is for the car to drive by its self. This will cause people to be dependant on the car to drive its self and will not be as alert in the vehicle and will result in a crash. Cars have always been made to be driven by a person, not a computer.

The driverless cars will be ran by automotive radar sensors, GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor among ther devices. Those things could break at any given moment and the passenger(s) in the car won't know and will assume everyhting is fine, but seconds later they are in a crash just because the car devices are broken. When someone is in the diverless car they could fall asleep or just could not be paying enough attention. Even though the seat will viberate when the person needs to take over, they could be a heavy sleeper and they won't feel the vibration. The car requires that the driver needs to be alert and ready to take over if the road conditions are too much to handle for the car to drive its slef. What happens when the person isn't paying attention? A car accident could and will happen.

So many things could go wrong with cars, so why add to the problem? The driver of the car needs to be alert. How will we know if we can trust that person to stay attentive to the car? By the time the car alerts the driver and the driver takes over it might be too late. The car could back into something or een swerve off the road and hit someone. Technology has glitches. If there is a glitch with one of the devices then the result could be life threatening. We won't know if we should blame the car or the person. Driverless cars are life threatening.
