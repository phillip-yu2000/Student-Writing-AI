I think that "driverless" cars are very dangerous. The driver could get too comfortable and fall asleep at the wheel, the car doesn't drive comepletly by it's self so you could not pay attention and get into a wreck, or you could get in trouble with the law because you hit another car or even a person.

I would think that these driverless cars are dangerous because the car could mess up and get into a wreck or hit a pedestrian and you would have to be charged because its the law. You would have to pay attention at all times no matter what because you never know what is going to happen. The driver could get tired waiting on their turn to drive and fall asleep. These cars can also accelarate and brake without the control of the driver so the car could speed and you would get a ticket for speeding, or the car could brake and cause the car behind you to wreck into you.

I think that driverless cars are dangerous because they require alot of attention. I would rather just drive myself so that I know that I would be safe and I wouldn't assume that the car can just drive by its self and get distracted by texting or talking to the people in the car. So, if you have a hard time staying awake when bored or paying attention then I wouldn't think this would be a car for you.
