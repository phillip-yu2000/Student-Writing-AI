the aurthor suggestion was a very convensing and belieavible i say this because we as humans are growing in population and one day we are going to need a place wehre we can fit all our people it may not be soon but if we keep groing like this i have no douts that we will fill this earth the aurthor has make this point clear in the story when he says " astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well be once have been the most earth like planet in out solar system. long ago," this shows his hope of finding something that we could rely on and this shows why it is worth exploring if we can make life in other planet then it it both benifical for us humans and animals. and some other reason why it is worth exploring venus is because we can obtain another planet to ourself a way bigger thing than a country "the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally " this is also why it ais worth exploring venus so we humans can have knowlage and experieance what it is like to be on another planet .
