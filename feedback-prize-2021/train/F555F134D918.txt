UNRRA is a great group that helps countries that were just in war to recover and they have started a group of "seagoing cowboys". This a great thiing to particiapate in, so don't miss it. Some reasons to particapate are that it helps people, it may be a once in a lifetime experience, and it's fun.

If helping others is important to you, wich it should be, you would love this experience. You can help people by supplying them with horses, cows, and mules according to the article "A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves". Also you help alot of desperate families. Even if you don't want to deal with animals you can help by recovering people's food supplies and if you don't want to do that there is even more that you can help with.

Also it could be a once in a lifetime experience. If you can't afford long distance travel this would be perfect because you get to travel and help people. Just think about it, a long time from now you might be thinking, "Man I wish I would have helped with that.", or something similare.

By now you may be convinced that you would love this, but if you're not, think of how FUN it would be. After you help with your mission you can go visit places like a castle, the Acropolis in Greece, and even go to Venice, Italy according to the article: A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves. Also as you are returning to home you can do things like play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling according to the same article.

Even though those are only a few reasons they would've conviced me to pariciapate. In my opinion, this would be an awesome opportunity for you to experince, so please don't miss it.
