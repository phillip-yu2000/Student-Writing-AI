The Electoral College in my opinion is the best way to elect the President of the United States. Although election by popular vote seems to be what the people want, using the Electoral College, is a better way to elect a President for many reasons.

One reason is that voters don't vote for what President they want, they vote for a slate of electors. A slate of electors is a group of electors that are biased towards a political party but understand politics more than any average person. Someone might say that election by popular vote is better because its more fair for every President in the race. This is because the slate of electors are biased towards one group, so say a republican running for President goes to a slate of electors full of democrats, there's no way he's going to win. Although election by popular vote seems to be the more fair way, the Electoral College needs to stay because it's more organized and the votes are based off of people who study politics and they aren't the average Joe's.
