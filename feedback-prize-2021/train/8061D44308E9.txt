Classes are important as they teach people the skills they will need in the future. Some schools offer online classes that can be taken from home, but the question of do they actually benefit students still remains. Students might say attending online classes would make it easier for them to learn, but with distractions everywhere and no hands on experiences students would struggle.

Distractions can be found anywhere. Schools try to limit the amount of distractions so students can have the best learning environment. At home distractions can be found left and right like TVs, phones, video games, and much more. Students might want to take a small breaks from their classes by going on their phone or watching TV. It is good for students to take small breaks, but sometime students will start taking longer and longer breaks and in the end just straight up procrastinating. While it could just start as a small distraction, it could eventually cause students to put off work and their grades to start dropping.

A lot of students learn better from hands on experiences. While just listening and writing down what you learn is sometimes good enough, some classes like biology, chemistry, and physics are easier to understand through labs. Online classes do not normally provide the materials needed for labs. While some labs you can do with materials at home, some require more dangerous materials like an open flame, sharp objects, or dangerous chemicals. Even if students can do the lab at home teachers are usually there to help or explain how the lab relates to the subject students are learning.

In the end I do not think online classes are that beneficial for students. While students could possibly learn at their own pace, with large amount of distractions at home and students needing hands on experiences to fully understand what they learn I think it is best if students stick to classes at school.
