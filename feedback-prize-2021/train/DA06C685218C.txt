I disagree with the principal beacuase no one should be forced to do anything that they dont want to to.

Students are sometimes lazy,so they dont want to do anything. so they just stay home and,play video games all day. when stay home all day all day everyday,that's how we as kids get over weight. on ther hand the principal can have his opinion. his opoinion wont matter because everyone has a choice.

what makes him think that he can fust force people to do stuff. no,no you can only control yourself. students have a good mind of there own. so students do what they think is best,and do what they want to do. students can follow the principals advice or dont follow his advice.

students ingeneral would love to have fun wile other's just want to eat and play video games. that's there choice like i said they have a great impact in life by what choices they make becuase it is hard sometimes. so dont let kids think that they can just do what you want them to do let them choose.

students get older and there mind is developing as they get older. so if the principal puts so much preasure on the kids he is also damageing there mind. and when i mean damageing i mean he is brainwashing there mind..now kids have a mind of ther own,some other's get brainwashed. when they get brainwashed they also lose there self,and they get out of control.

some kids have it hard in life,and i think it is wrong for the principal to put so much preasure on kids. for what beacuse he wants them to choose a sport,extracurricular activity. it should'nt matter if they da s activity or not they get to choose. you dont have to do activities if you dont want to. activities are just a thing that is extra.
