Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think students should have the option of choosing to do community service because community service is something that will benefit everyone.

If the student chooses to do community service, they will do a better job than if the student is forced.

I think the best thing to do instead of forcing students to choose community service, is to have a program that stresses the importance of getting involved with community service to get students interested.

It may inspire students to do community work and if it doesn't, they still saw how much it counts in our life.

Another way of getting kids involved without being required to is to explain all the different projects that can be done in their community and maybe take some of the interested ones with on the next project to see if they do like it.

If they don't, at least they tried and you may have found some other kids who would like to help.

Students will do a better and more satisfying job of the work they do if they do it on their own terms, whereas kids who are made to will probably not do their best and do their work sloppily.

They may still think it is taking away too much time and may not be responsible about their duties when doing community work.

Community service will be something everyone benefits from and will leave people more satisfied when it is done by people willing to work to make their community a better place than if it is done by someone who thinks it's unimportant and is not doing their best because of that belief.

Thank you for listening to my opinion on the subject and I hope you will take what I said into consideration.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
