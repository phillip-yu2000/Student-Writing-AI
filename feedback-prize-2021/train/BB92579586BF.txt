Advice is like an opinion that you take from someone else, it might not always be the truth and sometimes it is.

Letting people give you advice could help you and maybe not help you, I like peoples advice so it gives me more advice and feedback. It also expresses there life because they are picking which one would be better for you. If you wake up one morning and you cant choose between two shirts, you should ask people for there opinion, maybe they will give you the right answer. Some people dont like other peoples advice because, they like to solve there own problems and they like doing it on their own. Thats my opinion on either to take peoples advice or to just not take it. Taking advice can be hard because you never know when they are telling the truth or not. Sometimes people give you advice just to say something, and it might not be the truth. If you take someones advice you have to trust then to give you there best opinion.
