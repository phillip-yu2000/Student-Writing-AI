Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it would be a great idea to have the students be able to bring their cell phones to school. After school they can use them for various reasons. If the student is staying for practice or tutorial, they can call their parents or guardian to pick them up. If they miss the bus or need to clarify how to get home they can use their cell phone to contact their parents. The parent can also call the student if they need to talk to them about something. Students can use their phone to do research as well.

Another reason they should be aloud to use cell phones is because cell phones can be used after school too. Many students walk to McDonald's, Trade-winds, or other stores or restaurants in that area. The students need cell phones to be able to contact whoever is picking them up. During break students can also use cell phones for entertainment.

Students should only use cell phones in the designated time. I think you need to warn them that if they take advantage of having cell phones at school, they will be banned from school immediately. Any student who takes advantage of the new policy will be put into punishment and a number of continuous problems will shut the new policy down.

During class, students should not be able to use their cell phones, because they can start cheating, texting, or being off task. To stop this, I suggest that at the beginning of class teachers should pick up all cell phones. If a student is caught with a cell phone after they have been taken up, they should have the phone taken and held for a certain amount of days and the student should be put under punishment.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
