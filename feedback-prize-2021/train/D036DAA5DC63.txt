"Phones And Driving"

A common killer in america today is driving while looking at your cell phone. Drivers feel like it is more important to see who texted them instead of looking at the road which causes fatal accidents. Drivers must keep the eyes on the road to look for issues and problems in the road or to see if the light is green. Which as why there are campaigns supporting no driving while texting movement with a speech "It can wait" signifying that any text that comes through your phone can wait.

In 2015, reportedly 391,000 injuries were caused from drivers looking at cell phones and texting while driving. The statistics shows that drivers should never be allowed to look down at their phone while driving and if caught the driver should receive a ticket. Not only are you putting yourself in danger but others as well when look down for even one second the consequences will be fatal.

Furthermore, the "It can wait" campaign started by the phone company AT&T in 2010 to raise awareness by spreading this message. This message was put on billboards, tv commercials, and cereal boxes. A phone company wanted drivers to know that looking at your cell phone while driving can wait for when you are not driving.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to look at their phones while driving. For it can prove quite dangerous and fatal if its done. The the text can wait until the vehicle is not is parked in a suitable parking spot. Drivers should not even have look at the phone the phone should be out of reach and out of sight of the driver while they are driving
