Dear school principal,

Hi, I think that all students must participate in community service. I think they should because our Earth is getting messy. I have seen many students litter all over the school instead if putting it in the garbage where it belongs. I've seen some students throw banana pealing on the ground. I think you should convince the students to participate in community service. If they no that littering is doing many damage to our Earth maybe they might listen.

Lets talk about the positive aspects of community service, such as, cleaning the Earth makes our home much healthy. Also it is great for exercising. Walking around picking up litter actually burns calories, interesting Isn't it. By doing this we are setting a positive example to our Earth. This doesn't even take too much time. Just doing it for about ten minutes a day isn't bad. Plus if they need something they can get it after they're done, it's not that hard.

I'm here to help you convince them. Try showing the students a little video of what is going on when they litter. It might help them understand that community service is important. You can also make a speech about it and I can help you with the information. I'm just trying to keep our Earth healthy and clean. I hope this helps a lot, thank you.
