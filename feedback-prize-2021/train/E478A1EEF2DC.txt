Do you know the percentage of death caused by texting while driving? According to Edgar Snyder's website one out of four in the United States die or are critically injured from a car crash caused by a cell phone, this proves that cell phones while in the presence of driving should not be allowed.

There are many distractions that happen while driving and on your cellphone for instance; sending a quick message it doesn't take long right? According to a Virginia department of transportation website, it takes 3 seconds to have a car crash and fatally injure you or someone else, or even result in death. Although eating and driving is dangerous, studies from the Decide to Drive website showed that it's a lot safer to eat while driving then trying to operate your cellphone. Another distraction is talking on the phone with people. Some people can't multitask and risk their life to call/text someone. Trying to use social media such as snapchat while driving is extremely dangerous and a distraction we should try to avoid.

Snyder's website also says about 660,000 drivers are trying to use their phones behind the wheel which results in 1.6 million car crashes in a year. When in a wreck caused by a cellphone your risk losing your licenses, killing someone, injuring yourself, or even killing yourself. This shows how dangerous it is to use your cellphone while driving.

In conclusion, I recommend not operating your cellphone behind the wheel. It will make the road safer, and result in a decrease of deaths and injuries. Don't risk your life to send just a quick message or make a quick phone call, drivers should focus on the road and nothing more. Let's be safer and put the phones down.
