I would be against driverless cars because of the simple fact that you dont have any control of the car. One of the cars allow for the driver to be aware of the road and make certain gestures to make the car do as told.

As for my thoughts i would rather be in full control. A driverless car could also be a distraction, the driver may think the car has complet control but, it is not a human behind the wheel. One car can handle driving functions at 25 mph, but the driver has to keep control of the wheel. There is no point of having a car that can drive itself, if you have to watch the road.

First, you never know if the car has a problem. You could be just waiting on you turn to drive and the car has a moufunction. would you be alerted of that? What about other drivers that dont have the driverless car, every one dosent drive the same. their could be any problems on the road ahead of you and you could have no control of it because you car is driving.

In conclusion i think driverless car are not the best cars to have on the road. We have pedestrains and drivers to keep safe. Who knows what could happen havinfg a computerized car on the road, it's not safe. Computers have a mind of their own and we amire the safty of our roads.
