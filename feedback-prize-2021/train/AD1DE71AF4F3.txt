I think that smart cars should not be on the road because its a dangerous to others and yourself. Another reason is that somethig can happen like because it a cumputer it can get hacked, it put people lifes endanger on the road and off the road.

They haven't put all of the input that is necesssary for driverless car to a human at a wheel. Also this driveless car can get out of control skids. I say the only safe way is that people drive well some people if they can drive. If I were to choose Iwouldn't take a chance with driverless cars.

The smart cars shouldn't be on the roads because its dagerous to other and yourself also you wouldn't want to hurt someone. It would be really hard to wake up everyday knowing you killed somebody. So do the smart thing and drive yourself. Plus yuou would have less rist of killing someone if you drive your car not itself.
