If you were looking for advice, would you take advice from one preson or take advice form more then one preson to get multiple opinions?

I personly think you should get advice form more then one preson because geting advice form more then one preson can give you more then one prospetive on the situation you are trying to get advice on.

secondly why i think you should get you advice form other is that you get to pick out if the situation you are is bad for yuo or no like for exmaple if you are in a risk taken situation that you think you should do and you ask your mom if you should take the risk your mom might say no just to keep you safe but if you ask someone else that is a risk taker they might tell you to take a chane go thourght with it.

lastly why i think you should ask for more then one preson is that get advice form one person can lead to the right decision you are trying to make in that situation makeing the worng the choice can lead to hard times in your life and makeing the right choice can make your life much eazyer.

In conclueion geting advice form more then one person can make you see the worng and right form other people advice.
