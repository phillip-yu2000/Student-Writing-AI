This topic of Driverless Cars is amazing i've thought a lot about having a driverless car sometime in my future. I think is a good new invention that has been made. I think should be new laws the can limit certain driverless cars. And the fact that there will not be only one type of driverless cars but as other car manufacturers drive to build this great car will be awesome.

My biggest concern about these cars are the liability in the case of an accident. I do truly wonder if there is an accident between an driverless car and a regular car, who or what is to blame? The fact that the car has special touch sensors, what if there is a malfunction? But i do like that this car has speed sensors at the wheels antilock brakes.

Overall I am thinking that driverless cars are a good idea. With so many supporting qualities i think it is a safe car. I think over time there will be more advanced cars that take a new step at a time. I can't wait until 2020 when maybe Mercedes-Benz has an safe driverless car.
