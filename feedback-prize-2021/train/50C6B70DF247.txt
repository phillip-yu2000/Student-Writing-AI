Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that every student must do community service but don't force it. Make every student do community service for at least a week and if they don't like they don't have to do it but at least they can try it. maybe some Students that try will want to start doing community service more often to help. like a few of my friends pick up litter and it could show other kids that helping out the community can help earth and them self in becoming an adult you could have some students that do community service tell the school about what they do and how they like it also why they started to help out in community service. It could give soon kids would want to try doing community service. so for Example we could start by cleaning up around the school and are local playgrounds. Only to give the students who don't do community service or says that it takes up some of there hang out time a taste of community service. some of them could even tutor some younger kids in 5th or 6th grade. They could tell them about middle school and the work. All my friends that do community service say that they love to help out the community so think about my idea.

Please take these into consideration.

yours,

STUDENT_NAME
