Could you imagine sitting behind a wheel of a driveless car? The thought may sound good, but in reality it's worse. Automakers should prevent making driveless cars. Driveless cars are dangerous, and a waste of money.

Driveless cars are dangerous. In the state of Indiana about five out of ten smart cars are bought each day. About one out of three cars are wrecked each day. The features of normal cars are already distracting. Let alone make a driveless car. In paragraph eight, it states "wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?" If a driver got bored waiting on their turn they could easily fall asleep. What if they fell into a deep sleep? That would be even more dangerous. Also, easier for a wreck to occur. The driver could easily get distracted by their phone or anything. All of these situations are dangerous. Nobody should take the risk of hurting someone or themselves.

Driveless cars are a waste of money. In paragraph ten, it stated "Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020." Here in Indiana, a Mercedes-Benz run about $80,000. Imagine spending that much on just one car. You can buy two for just that one price. People will spend that amount on a new car, but not college. Around the world, two out of three students miss out on college. Imagine your mother spending that much on a new driveless car instead of college for you. Wouldn't that hurt your feelings?

Driveless cars are dangerous, and a waste of money. Automakers should prevent making driveless cars. You can save about ten lives a day by preventing driveless cars. May we all strive to help save a life. I wouldn't waste my money on a driveless car, and neither should you.
