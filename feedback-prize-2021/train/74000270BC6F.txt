Facial Action Coding System, a program that can determin the emotion of a person. This new program will surely help in the feild of phycology. The use of this program can be almost limitless when used corectly. Now that this program is real how should it be used. Should it be used to help the police find potental victums or used to see how people are feeling at work or school.

In the article "Making Mona Lisa Smile" by Nick D'Alto he talked about its potential use at schools and how it could benefit schools by determinig if a studient is not learning or not happy. The use of this program has pros and cons, but in todays world it might be best to use it.

Anyone who keeps up with the news should be able to say that the world is getting more messed up every day. In the last few weeks there has been another school shooting. To think about what would make a kid go and shoot people at a school or anywhere is hard to imagine. This is where this program should be implented at schools. The program could be used to anylise the daily emmotion level of students. If a studient is always unhappy, scared, or anything that shows a bad emmotion for a period of time the school can then act an see what the studients problem is. Nick D'Alto said that it could be used to help students be more ingaged and enjoy school more. This should not be used, unless the kid is being home schooled or using some form of an online class. This is because there is no way for a teacher to consantly moniter their students wheil teaching and there is not a good way for them to adapt when nessasary in the time that they have. Also kids are already unhappy to be at school and not too mention how teired they are.

For this program to be used at school it should only be used to monater their happyness levels to prevent studients from doing bad things like commiting suiside or doing a school shooting. Any other use would be hard to anylize and or use in the way that Nick D'Alto mentioned.
