This letter is to my state senator in which i argue in favor of keeping the electoral colloge by popular votes for tha president of tha united state. As you can see the electoral college is a process, not a place so there for the founding father established in tha constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and electiuon of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. ther are many reasone for retaining the electoral but ther are five of them for why are state senator shuld keep the elctoral and the five are certainty of outcome ,everyonss president, swing states,big states, and avoid run-off elctions. it can be argued that the electoral colleg method of selecting the president may turn off potential voteers for a candidate who has hope of carrying their state democrats .also keeping tha electrol college is becuse it requires a presidentail candidate to have trans regional appeal. its official that the best arguments in favor of keeping the electoral becuase it mostly assertions without much basis in reality and the arguments against direct election are spuriouse at best.
