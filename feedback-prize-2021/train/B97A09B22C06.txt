You have to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It will open the world up to you. The program is really fun, and could help you with some of your problems. It really helped me in life. You get to see cool things. You can relax. Then sometimes there a lot of work involved. Anyone could be interested if they tried.

The article says there is a lot of war like things involved as well. It gets pretty dirty and rough to be a seagoing cowboy. I would suggest doing because it gives you oppertunities, and soemtimes it can be fun. You can't be weak and not willing to do work though. There is a lot of training to go through and it is not easy. So if your a hard working worker this is the place for you to be.

Then there are some severe injuries or even worse. You got to be tough though. I have a good time though. Beside the work, but sometimes it can be fun. You have company as well to cheer you up when your down. Some work you have to do is cleaning, feeding the animals, or even pulling or pushing heavy objects. Like in the article it said the animals have to be fed or watered two or three times a day.

Yet all the work there is fun. Like seeing all of the awesome landscapes or cities. If you feel down this will bring you up. Watching the sun set. Being with workers that are kind. There is more and more. It is just what kind of person you are. If you are a hard worker and like to see cool things. This is the place for you. It is really fun if you can see how it is fun to help people and animals. L hope this inspires you to be a seagoing cowboy. The program is great.
