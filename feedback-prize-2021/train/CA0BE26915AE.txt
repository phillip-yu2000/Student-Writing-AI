Everyday around the world most people get into a car accident because they use cell phones while driving. Research has stated that cell phones are the main factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a crash. Although drivers know the risks and dangers of using a phone while driving, people still use it because they want to use it and be able to be in touch with other people. I advise people that are driving to not use their cell phones while driving because it can be a major distraction.

The cases of fatal automobile accidents, related to cell phone use while driving, have risen dramatically over the past few years. Majority of these people are younger people under the age of 25 years old or even younger. The cell phone use while driving causes more negative incidents than positive incidents. It causes road rage from other drivers, traffic jams, and minor accidents. I think that using a phone while driving is underrated, studies show that it is more dangerous than most people make it out to be; teenagers seems to be the worst at it.

Some people think that texting on a cellphone is considered the only thing when they say "stop using your cell phone and driving". Using a cellphone while driving means doing everything whether it is texting or talking on the phone. I've learned a lot about using a phone and driving from researching. I am one of probably millions of teenagers who thought that phones while driving isn't that big of a deal but, after researching and reading all of the things

I've seen and seeing all of the things I saw. Using a cellphone while driving is one of the things I'm going to take into consideration.

If people don't give up cell- phones the number of people getting hurt on the road is going to increase drastically. It is your responsibility do not put your life and other peoples lives a risk.
