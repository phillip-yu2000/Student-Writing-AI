The author supports this idea very well, becuase he has dine lots of research. Trying to visit planet Venus can be very dangerous becuase of what it has on and around the planet. "Humans have sent many spaceships to Venus but no spacecraft had survived the land for more than a few hours", said the author. The only reason that we can not stay on the planet is because, one there is a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent carbon dioxid. Two becuase in order to get on to the planet you would have to go through clouds and clouds on Venus are not like clouds on Earth. But on Venus they are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Three on the planets surface the tempertures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Four the atmostpheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we have on Earth. And these conditions are far more extreme than ANYTHING on Earth. With that kind of atmostpheric pressure it woukd crush a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of the ocean, and it would liquefy many metals. Venus has the hottest surface than any planet in the Solar System, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Venus is just like Earth, there are some features on Venus that Earth has. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment, and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters. NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. But with the technolgy that Earth has today i think that we could send something to Venus to do research. To see if were to be able to send someone there and take samples. But striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has vlaue, not only because of insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us to many eauality intimidating endeavors.
