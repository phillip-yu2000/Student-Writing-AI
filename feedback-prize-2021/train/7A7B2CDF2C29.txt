I think going to join the Seagoing cowboys program would be intersting for boys and there's a lot of good reasons they should go.

The cattle boat rides,visting places like Europe,China,and Greece. The cattle boat rides would be activity to do for fun. Visting places like Chinca, Europe ect. would be very interesting because you get to meet and learn bout people from different culutre and state andh help peoepl out from that state and learn what they do that we don't or what you probably never heard of. You can baseball or volly ball with you team and make new friends get to know people better. They play tennis,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling ,and games. Reading can help you etter in life if you ever deside you want to read so thats a reason boy should join the program. Also you can learn new and differen things through the program you can go with your friends or family thers's alot of activties for kids and aldults to do. Fencing can be a little excersise for you to stay slim whille you're out there.
