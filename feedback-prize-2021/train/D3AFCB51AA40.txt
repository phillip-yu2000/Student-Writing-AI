Dear Principal,

In my personal opinion it would be wrong to simply deny these other students an opportunity to do something as sentimental as sports. But unfortunately I understand why you would consider this.

I understand that if you enforce this new rule you hope that students will focus more on their school work, and we all understand that's what's most important, however I believe that by doing this, you would instead discouraging a considerable amount of students into believing that they are inferior to others. This new rule could seriously hurt others self esteem, and that seems very unfair.

I do believe, (though it makes me a bit uncomfortable to admit it) the final choice remains with you as it shall stay, I do advise you, even if iv given my opinion I strongly suggest you seek the advice of other staff members and how they see the issue, you may even go as far as asking the students them selves how they feel. With that being said, Sir, ask yourself, do you really want to make your students so miserable that they can't even complete the simplest of task? Or would you attempt to encourage that unfound skill with praise and care?

I simply wrote this letter to make you re think your view on the matter in hopes that you will decide to help rather than destroy the confidence of so many that try so hard.
