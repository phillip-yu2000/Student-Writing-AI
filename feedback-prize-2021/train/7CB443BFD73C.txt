Both Vuaban, Germany and Bogota, Columbia have the right idea...take cars off of the street. While Bogota only bans cars for the length of a full day; Vuaban doesn't ban cars, but the prices are well expensive and there are not many parking spaces in the surburban city. Limited car usage can reduce smog and greenhouse levels, and with the advancement of technology, limited car usage should be inforced.

The smog levels in Paris are absolutely outrageous, "[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussls and 79.7 in London, Reuters found" (Duffer). The smog amounts , according to Duffer, were almost at the level of Beijing, China which is the most polluted place on earth. By enforcing a short driving ban, set for only a day, on even-numbered license plates to clear the heightening amount of gases in the air, the smog levels dropped enough to release the ban set for odd-numbered license plates the next day. This experience proves that limiting car usage can prevent air pollution exponentially.

With the advancement of technolgy, people have no real need to go travel everytime they want to talk to someone, whether it be family or friends. With technology and social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Facebook Messenger, just a few clicks and we are able to have a connection with them. There is also the option of calling someone, so there is always a way to keep in contact. "... the Internet makes communication possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends" (Rosenthal). As Ms. Rosenthal has so clearly stated, why travel and spend money only to say a few words.

By limiting the usage of cars, air pollution will be greatly diminished, and the advancement of technology unlimits us from keeping steady communication.
