As times keeps passing new technologies seem to come around very often. From new cars and cellphones. To fully solar powered houses and computer controled homes. technology seems to be benefitting us. But what about the students? A new form of technology has been develope that is able to detect exactly how a student is feeling. But is it a good thing ? I beleive it is.

in today's modern day there is new software that has been developed that can detect a persons emotion. This is called the "Facial Action Coding System". This softerware is said to be able to contribute to a students learning ability. The article "Making The Mona Lisa Smile" presents the idea of a classroom using this technology in order to benefit a students way of the learning. In paragraph 6 of this article it reads, "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ... Then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor." This expresses the idea of a more productive instructor that can help a student based on how they feel and individually help a student.

This new software could elevate the quality of learning. A normal classroom only contains one teacher in charge of various students with different needs. Each with a different style of learning. A computer system that can help each and every one of those students learn in their own way could be very benificial since the way they are being instructed is based on how they feel. The " Facial Action Coding system" is agood thing for our students and should be involved in our students leanring.
