Teachers has given students an option for summer school, either they design their own project or the teacher design it for them..Students should be allowed to design their own summer project because they will understand it more, get it done right, and you will take your time on it.

If students design there own project for the summer then they will understand it more. I say that because you go to summer school to get help that you couldn't get during school. So of course you will want a teacher to design a project for you to do. But if you find a project to do yourself you will see its much less complicated than the teachers. Plus you want have to listen to the teacher orders because its your own design.

Another reason why is you will get it done right. If you designing your own project you shouldn't mess it up, it should be perfect. You have to trust in your self that you can do it right. I made a project on cars once I got a A+ on it because I designed it myself so everything was perfect. Everything you do is not going to be perfect but when its your piece of work it should be close to A1.

Lastly if you design your own summer project you will take your time on it. Lets be honest, most time when a teacher gives you a assignment that you don't like you will rush through it. If you are designing your own assignment then you will learn to take your time because you would want perfection to come from your own work. For example you won't have to worry about rushing on your research, finding your resources, and even decorating it. Everything is on your own time.

In conclusion students should design there own summer projects to make it easier on themselves. They won't have to rush, it will be more understanding, and it should be a perfect project. Teachers want you to do things their way but sometimes you have to do your own thing. So after you can enjoy your summer break.
