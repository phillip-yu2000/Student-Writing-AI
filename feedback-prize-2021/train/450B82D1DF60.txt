Imagine having to do a project or school assignment where you have full control over it with no teacher instruction and having no idea where to start. Some schools think that they should let students have full control over their summer project. But actually, teachers should be the ones to managed the students projects. Because students could end up not doing it or some students just dont know where to start.

People think students should have control over their projects because students can express themselves better and get all their thinking down on paper when its not controlled by a teacher. Since its summer students would have better topics to talk about in their projects. Or simply some students might not like the chosen topic for the project and refuse to even start it.

Projects would be better in quality if teacher set a couple of standards for students to follow. Therefore a student can get a better idea of where to start. Some students arent as creative as other and they need some guidance to get them going. if there is something specific a teacher wants students to do its easier to research or study that topic rather than having to come up with your own.

During summer students have a lotÂ going on whether its vacations or other things. if projects are left for them to design some students might not even do it because of how busy they are. But if teacher takes charge over the project it will stay in the back of students minds an remind them to make time for them to complete it.
