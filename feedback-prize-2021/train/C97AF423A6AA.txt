Policy 2,

Students like using their phones, but usually don't know when to turn them off during class. There are many times when their caught using the phones during class or other free time. While in school you may see students walking the halls and maybe some have a phone. Should you not allow anyone to use the phones or should they?

When in a class most students are talking to others by texting them from another class. It's harder for the student to do any work and also to bring their grade up if their failing. It's easier if you wouldn't allow them to use the phones during the class time in fact not allow them to use them at all. Even if they had free time they should finish their book or their homework.

Try watching them more often to make shore they don't turn them on they should be aloud to bring them in but not aloud to use them at all. If you see someone use the phone take it from them and give it back at the end of the day. If they continue then take it and tell them if they don't stop they'll never get it back again. If the teacher can't stop it or if you can't tell the parent about it and talk to them. Tell them everything that has happened each day their child has used their phone. If their not satisfied they might take away the phone from their child and only allow them to use it when they are in need of help.

Talk to the students in the school about using phone safety they maybe talking to a friend or someone that claims to be there friend, a student that may not like them. If none of this helps then ban phones from the school and only allow them to use the office phone if a student needs to call someone.

Should you allow them to use the phones? Well no, it may not be so bad a first but once they start getting out of control it'll be harder to pull them away. They should be banned and not allowed, even I don't bring my phone and never need to use it. They should get used to not using them in awhile.
