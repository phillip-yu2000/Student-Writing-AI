Reading emotions is done on a day to day bases in the minds of people. That is how we can tell is our friends are upset or happy about something. The author of "Making Mona Lisa Smile", Nick D'Alto, talks about new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students would be valuable so the teacher can see how well they have to students attention and what they can do to change things if they need to. If teachers had the ability to use the FACS, they would be able to see how many students enjoy the class and that they are focused on the class. Also they would be able to see how many kids aren't happy to be in class and no paying attention. The FACS can read the emotions happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. A teacher wants to have all the attention of their students but, it doesn't always happen, teachers knowing when students start to fade out of the topic can help them change how they are teacher to help the student want to learn and stay on task. All around students need to learn and teachers need to teach, it would be very useful to have teachers be able to access the FACS to be able to teach to the best of their abilities so that the students car and will learn. Reading others emotions easily would make everyone's lives easier beacause they know how they really feel about something. So, people can change what they are doing to help other people want to do things.
