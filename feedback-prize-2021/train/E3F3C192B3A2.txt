Dear state senator,The Electoral College is an American process that is unfair and is getting over on people every election by possibly voting for people that whould not like the President whe're voting for to be in office. If I'm American and my country is having an Presidential election i would like to vote for the President that i think is suitable to be in office but to know that i cuold possibly be voting for people who are not going to choose my selection is displeas ing.

Some people say that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in political balance that large states (by population) lose by the virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. But by saying that they're basically saying that they dont trust the Citizens in big state's to know what they're doing when voting for a President. Buy changing the election to popular vote you're letting the people know that theire vote realy does count instead of us basically voting for the people that are going to vote for us. A strong reason why i favor the abolishment of the Electoral College is because the president is chosen by the people (citizens of america) instead another group of people chosing for you i mean its like they think those are the only people in the united states.
