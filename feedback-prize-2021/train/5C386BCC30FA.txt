Driverless cars have been imagined for many years. They've come close to building it but fails to be officaly called driverless cars, google has tryed but have only made it to where the car alerts a driver if to close to an object. Theirs been other ways on trying to make a driveless car but come out in fails or to expasive, like the smart-road that has been tested and has had positve records "but that would mean we would have to change all the roads and make knew ones that would take for ever and the money we would spend on that would leave our economy more in dete then we are". As the article said.

If driverless cars were to be created in the future how would that impact lifes and country? Well let me tell you more safte laws would have to be made "like how would be acounted for if some one gets hurt because of a failer in the system, would it be the owner of the car or the companys fault for the failer in their technology". As the articl said that could cause major problams. With what I just mentioned that brings me to my second question. What if something in the car fails would that impact the intier car and cuase it to break down? As the artical mentions the people trying to creat the driveless car have been testing int with a lot of different technology as said in the artical they've been using sensors, cameras and GPS on the cars, but what if one of the cameras or the sensors would fail to do their job while it's driving on a highway or a main road that would cuase a worse accident then with someone driving it.

In conclusion I would prefer driving so I have more liabilty to know where im going and know that im the one driving. So i ask you would you rather lay your life and family or friends on a a computer or know that you can drive. That is my opion on driveless cars.
