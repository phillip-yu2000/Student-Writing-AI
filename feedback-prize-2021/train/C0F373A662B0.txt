Hey, this is Luke Bomberger and I think that you should become a Seagoing Cowboy! When I was a small boy my friend Don invited me to go to Europe. When I couldn't think of a reason to say no I went with him. I'm glad I did because if I hadn't I wouldn't ever have become a Seagoing Cowboy. You can have many things if you become a Seagoing Cowboy!

Instead of my service I became a Seagoing Cowboy and got animals across the sea safely. I washed them and cleaned them over and over but in all those chores I got to travel!

I got to see Europe, China, Greece, and Italy! I was a small town farm boy and then I got to see all of these places, all because I became a Seagoing Cowboy! You can become one too!

I'll admit that there are some dangers in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I almost fell overboard and broke my ribs! I wasn't able to do anything for the animals for a couple of days but they kept me company. Even though becoming a Seagoing Cowboy has its faults it overall is very exilerating and makes life an adventure! You can become a Seagoing Cowboy just like me!

If all that doesn't satisfy you, this will! When there are no animals aboard to take care of you can play games to pass the time. These games include baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, and table tennis tournaments! When you are playing these games with all the other cowboys you tend to make cowboy friends almost immediatly! You can sign up right now to make new friends and play games with them!

All in all the Seagoing Cowboy experiance was the best experiance of my life. I hope that everyone gets the chance to have this experiance! You can have adventure to make you feel alive. You can have tourism to let you have experiance across the world. You can have games and new friends to keep you company and help you pass the time! You can have many things if you become a Seagoing Cowboy!
