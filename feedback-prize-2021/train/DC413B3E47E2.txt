When it comes down to voting it should always be fair. Keeping the Electoral College would be better. Electoral College would be much more fair because it avoids problems in elections when a can didate receives a majority of votes, restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose, disputes rarely happens. I claim that retaining Electoral college is far more superior.

To start off keeping electoral college is best because it restores political balance that large states can not have. For example the popular vote was close in florida. The winner Obama had 29 electoral votes. Wyoming with 3 electoral votes so others were equal. Large states had more attention from presidential candidates within a campaign than a small state.

To add on it is only better to stick with electoral college because it avoids problems in elections. For example nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes. By winning majority in electoral college there is pressure. The pressure would complicate the election process. But since its reduced by electoral college a winner is annouced.
