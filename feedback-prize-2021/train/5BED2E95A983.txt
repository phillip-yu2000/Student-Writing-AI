A lot of people always dream of touring around the world. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, touring will be a normal part of life. For example, I, Luke Bomberger, got to see many sights. I was able to see the Acropolis in Greee, go gondala riding in Venice, Italy, see the excavated castle in Crete, and see the Panama Canal on my way to China. Not to mention just being all around Europe and China. If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, sight-seeing will become pretty much a daily activitiy.

Most people in this world are animal lovers. For these people I can say that being a Seagoing Cowboy is the lifestyle for you. Everyday that you are on the cattle boat, you get to treat animals. I was on a cattle boat with 335 horses and it was an experience of a lifetime. I got to feed, clean, and care for the horses everyday. If you are willing to take on the responsibility of caring for animals, then sign up for the Seagoing Cowboys program.

If you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will get to help others in need. For example, at the end of World War ll, many countries in Europe were devistated and destroyed. I helped by exporting animals such as horses, cows, and mules to other countries from Europe. If you join the Seagoing Cowboy program, you will get to say that you helped people at their most devistating times.

In conclusion, if you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you will travel the world, care for animals, and help others. As a Seagoing Cowboy, I can say that at the time I was a Seagoing Cowboy was the best time of my life.
