In this article they are talking about a way calculate our emothins called FACS. Prof. Thomas Huang is the creater of this technology with of course some other people. It is a highly advanced mood ring of sourts but intead of just guessing, it makes a 3D model of you face that allows it to calculate what you feeling. Thomas Huang paired with an psycholgists to determin the different signs of emotion so he would be able to prepare the machine.

This idea could change the way we learn today;we realy on our technology so much today kids now day do the bare minimum to pass. Most of the pappers we do we are googling the awnsers. It is about time we find a way to teach the future gerenation. If we had this kind of technology scanning us and being able to tell when the kids do not uderstand what they are being taught it could possibly boost our learning and help better us for the future. I know from expersience that if I am not aware of what I am being taught I will just look up the awnsers or find someone who already did it.

This may just make us get the upper hand in our nation on learning. As we sit today I really do not know how future generation will ever make it heck I do not know if we will. Yes this way of using FACS is a little creepy and it may be a violtinon of our right but really we have no right till about 21 years of age. So lets get this stuff up and running allow our future generation to learn better and not have to cheat when things get tough. What may also help is if we throw a tutor in there to help when they notice when we dont't understand something.
