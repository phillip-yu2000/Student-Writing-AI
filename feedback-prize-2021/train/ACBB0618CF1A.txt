Do you you think that students should be required to take at least one extracurricular activity.

I think they should because it can help them stay healthy, students could make more friends that are interested in the same activity, students can set goals for them selves that are for their activity, and it can give them something to look forward to because they should be able to choose their activity.

Being healthy is important because in order for students to do their best they need to be healthy. And giving students the choices of sports helps them stay in shape and healthy. Keeping students involved with sports keeps them active and the more sports they play the more active they are.

Keeping the student in sports keeps them healthy and that helps them do their best .

If a student is in a club there will be more students in the club with the same interests and it will be easy for them to make friends.

Making friends in the same groups of interests is good because they will have a lot to talk about.

And being social is important because having a good social life will make you be happier.

And students need to learn about how to deal with social situations.

It will help students learn to set and achieve goals.

If a student is on a sports team they will have to set goals for them selves and achieve them . Because if their grades are not good enough they could be kicked off the team.

so for the students keeping their grades will be a goal they need to set and achieve.

I think it is a great idea for students to have to participate in extracurricular activities.

Because keeping yourself busy is allways better then being bored

.and giving students activitys to look foward to is a great thing.

so if giving students extracurricular activites will keep students healthy, help them make friends, and learn how to set and acheve goals i think its a great idea.
