Hi there, my name is STUDENT_NAME I'm writing a letter to you today about the my concerns about the grades you need to participate in school sports.

A lot of people at my school try their very best with their school work, but just can't seem to keep that average B grade up. And I think it's unfair myself because I'm a C or B average student and I do try my best with my school work I'm on time for school turn my assignment in on time and study before any test quiz or exam I just can manage a B in every class even though i try extra hard.

Now what if I wanted to try out for a sport say.. Cheerleading for my school are you saying i wouldn't be able to participate in the after school activity just because I have two little C' s?

Now don't me wrong, i' d want better but a C is a passing grade but what if i tried out, so happens a made it, they same I'm one of the best cheerleaders on the squad then they check my grades and see that i have a 75% in science and a 78% in Social Studies those grades would be easy to bring up. But why take me off the team if I'm a great player? But then you let someone on the team with a 79% basically a high C, not a B though yet. Now that wouldn't be fair would it?

That's why I think if you have a C or better you should be allowed on the team with a C because if you are working hard and just have on C.

you should be allowed to be in a sport at school, that's why parks and recreation sports don't go by grades or try outs they just take your money and whatever you sign up for that season is exactly what you payed for, there aren't any limitations.

Those are my thoughts about your new "considerations" with the school sports dilemma.

From,

STUDENT_NAME.
