First of all,Driverless cars are a great idea to have in the future because it helps prevent alot of accidents and would be cool to have. I think they should do more stuff to the driverless car like add a entertainment center so the driver would be entertained and more people would probably be interested in buying one in the future. Driverless cars would be wonderful to have in the future because they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves without a human having to do anything and it would notify a human driver to take over when the situation requires.

Also, manufactures are considering to use cameras to watch the driver while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver so that the driver is not texting or doing other things while driving, which would prevent accidents or being pulled over and given a ticket. A negative thing about having a driverless car is that drivers would get bored when waiting for their turn to drive. But, some manufactures hope to bring in some car enterainment and information systems so that the driver would be entertained in having something to do when they´re not driving.

Finally, driverless cars would be great to have in the future because it has all this new technology inside that would keep you safe and entertained when you´re not driving. Although, driverless cars has some negative things about it that would need work on but overall, I would reccomend it to people to buy in the future. Also, this specific car would help prevent alot of accidents and deaths from a regular car because a driverless car has a camera to watch what you´re doing so you are safe.
