Many kids in America like to play sports for there school. But in order to play sports right now you have to a certain grade point average which is a "c" or higher. But there may be a change to the certain grade point average. I am going to right to my principal why i think it would be a good idea.

"Hello TEACHER_NAME I am for your change about the grade point average change." I think that students in America that have the interest to tryout for sports just do the minimum work to pass at a "C" average. What I am saying is that it would probably be a good idea that the GPA requirement be raised because student aren't giving there best shot at there school work. So I think that if it is raised to a "B" average it will be harder for students to goof off and pass.

This is why I am for the GPA change, because it will make students have to perform better than what most kids do. Like I said they just try to get away with the bare minimum, but there are a few students who actually want to make the best grades possible so they study and do there homework and school work. For example my friend RELATIVE_NAME has issues with staying focused on his homework and doesn't like to do his school work and hates to study. But one of the main problems is that he is obsessed with his video game system he stays up late every night and plays when he should be in bed getting a good nights rest for the next school day. Not to mention he is the best baseball player for his school but he is not eligible to play because of his grades.
