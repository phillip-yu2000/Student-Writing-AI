This new technology to allow us to read students emotional expressions is brilliant. Reasons being is it allows students to show their true emotion regardless if they act happy, or sad. This will more likely have less kids hide their emotion and can truly be worked on. It can be the difference between life or death. To prove that this technology can be used in advance, most of us know the famous picture of the Mona Lisa. Using this advance system most people will say she is just happy and smiling, 'but she's actually 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry'. Obviously we have more then one feeling but this is an prime example of showing this can work on other people and pictures from years ago and still show their full emotions, most people can claim to be happy a lot and be completley devasted. This will be the future to help towards others and will soon help for the greater good.
