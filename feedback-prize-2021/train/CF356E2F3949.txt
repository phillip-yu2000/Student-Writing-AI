In today's world there is a lot of amazing technology. Technology has come a long way than what it used to be. The technology that we use today is way better and hytech than what it has ever been before.

In this article there was a lot of talk on how computer here and their can do Facial Action Coding System. The Facial Action Coding System was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is designed to pick up every movement in a humans face and can determine different emotions with those sudden movements. There are six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Each and everyone of those emotions are determined by ones muscle movement in the face. I think the FACS is a very valuable piece of technology that can be used in the classroom for many different purposes. Some of the purposes are learning and just to have fun and mess around with each other to see what your emotions are and how you can change those emotions. The most important purpose for this new piece of technology is the learning purpose behind it. It can be used to learn many different things in a humans body and can learn the different muscles in ones face and how they differ from one to another. The article states that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, which means that different emotions can go to a different muscle movement in the face.

I think personally that this new peice of technology called FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a very valuable thing for the classroom. It has many different learning objectives behind it and can be used for other activities besides learning purposes. Yes, also the technology that is around us today is amazing and is amazing what it can do.
