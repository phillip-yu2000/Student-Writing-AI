Another reasons was because it was an adventure, but in the story it says," Being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger." He had fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been unload.

It was fun after unload because they played baseballand volleyball games in the empty holds where aniamls had been housed.

They also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whitting, and games help time go pass.

He said," The cattle trips were an unbelieveable opportuinty for a samll town boy."

While helping people he had a benfit of seeing Europe and China. "But seeing the Acropoils in Greece was special," he said.

"So was taking a ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."

Luke aslo tuored an excavated castle in Crete and Marveled at the Panama Canal On his way to China.

Luke was amazed of place he went and saw.

It kept Luke busy when caring for the animals during the crossings. Being a Seagoing Cowboy opened up a world for Luke.
