I think that we should have cell phones at school. Some people have to call there parents after school to make sure there coming to pick them up, or tell them that there staying after school.

I also think that we should be able to use them during free periods like gym, certain electives, and lunch. I don't think cell phones are a bad thing to have at school. They do not harm kids, unless someone is texting or calling to say bad things to someone else. If that does happen then they should go to a adult or teacher or someone like that about it.

I want to have my cell phone at school, so incase something happens to my family, or there is a emergency with them, they can reach me. After school I do a lot of stuff too, like going out with my friends, or after school programs. If i don't have my phone with me then my parents would not know where I am or what I am doing, and that can cause a big problem. I like to keep my phone with me at all times because if i put it down for just a minute i would probably lose it.

If we did have our phones at school, I do think that we should have it off or on silent during all our major classes. It could cause a distraction to ourselves, and the students around us if it was on. I am all for having my phone at school, and I do want this rule to change and let us have them. I think students should have there phones, especially if they walk home. Phones are not just for texting and calling there also for emergency's, if something happens then you need a phone to contact help. That is why I think we should be allowed to have cell phones on school campus.
