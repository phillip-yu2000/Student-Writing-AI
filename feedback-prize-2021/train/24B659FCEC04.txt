Dear principal,

I'm going to tell you two reason why I think it's not fair for students that only have a B average to play sports. My reasons are most kids have a C average and teachers won't be able to do anything in their spare time.

My example is most kids have a C average. My first supporting detail is you wont have any teams. You won't have any teams because if most kids make a C average then none of them would be able to try out.

My second supporting detail is no players. You won't have any players because they would all have made C' s and would not be allowed to try out.

My third supporting detail is you won't have any trophy's. You won't have any trophy's because if no one is allowed to try out then you won't win any games, and if you don't win any games then you won't get any trophy's to put in your display case, so none of the visitors will be able to see any because you won't have none.

My last example is teachers won't be able to do anything in their spare time.

My first supporting detail is no after school sessions. You wont have after school sessions for the teachers to occupy their time because you won't have any students on your team to stay after school. My second supporting detail is no pep rally's. You wont have any pep rally's because of no students on your teams, so the teachers won't be able to set them up in their spare time.

My last supporting detail is the teachers wont have anyone to help. They won't have anyone to help because no one would be on teams, and the teachers won't be able to help out with the students in their spare time.

In conclusion, I have told you two reasons why I think it's not fair to only have students to try out for sports based on their grades they make. My examples was, most kids make a C average and teachers won't be able to do anything in their spare time. Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
