The driverless cars would be something people would like to have but they may not be very safe. There is the same amount of negative aspects as well as positive aspects of the cars. I am mostly against the the development of the driverless cars.

The cars have sensors to alert the drivers if they are heading towards something dangerous or the car deal with the circumstance they're in. The cars have gone miles without crashing but still need a driver. What if the car is in traffic issues where the driver needs to be in control and the sensor is broke and can't alert the driver? The driver could stop paying attention for one second and the car could wreck. The sensors could also malfunction and run into something when it was supposed to brake.

The car also vibrates and has flashing lights to warn the driver. The vibration and lights could become dull and the driver may not notice them. The driver could then wreck or get hurt because he or she didn't know they were supposed to drive or not.

There are not laws to protect someone if there is an accident. The car could fail and no one would know who to blame. It is illegal to drive these cars in most states because they're not fully safe. What if someone thinks they're safe and the laws pass to where people can drive them but they malfunction? Who would get in trouble? The driver or the manufacturer?

Even though they could be safer than a person driving, the car is still not completely safe. There are good qualities of the car like the warning signs and the entertainment while people aren't driving but those could break. The technology of the car could fail and hurt someone or multiple people. Some could think that the car is durable but they would still need to take precautions.
