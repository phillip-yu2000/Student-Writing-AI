Do you knw what would be absolutly great? Well youÃÂ´re probably thinking of hundreds of things, but I know what didnÃÂ´t cross your mind and that is participating in extracurricular activities. Participating in at least one of these can change your life and should be mandatory.

Extracurricular activities should be mandatory because of two words ÃÂ¨The FutureÃÂ¨. Going to school is all about bettering your future. So what is a better way then having a extracurricular activity that you participate in? Besides being rich there is nothing and IÃÂ´m going to tell you why. One way itÃÂ´s better is it just gives you more things to put on a job application. The extracurricular also make colleges notice you more and can lead to many colleges wanting you to be at their school so everything will be paid for.

The Last reason I think a extracurricular activity should be mandatory is to work on students management skills.

Being in a extracurricular you would need to know how to find time for homework, studying, spending time with your family,and etc. Budgeting time is a skill you would need as you grow up no matter what you grow up to be or do. Considering that, learning how to at a young age makes it easier when you need to buget time the most.

In conclusion, extracurricular activities helps you better your life and effects your future to certain levels that could make your life better if you just do it. So make sure you get involved cause you would regret it later.
