The Author for the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming" gave both good key points on why we should have driverless cars as well as key points on why we shouldn't have driverless cars.

My position on this specific topic is that i believe that having a driverless car would be proficient to the human life because then you wouldn't have to wrooy about if your tired or not and you don't have to worry about taking those harmful energy drinks when you drive because you need to stay awake. Because since you have a driverless car you are capable of practically doing anything you have to do within the time period you have from your starting destination the your final destination. You could finish up work you didn't get done, you could actually eat your breakfast, you could actually look into some important things while your car gets you to your destination. although there are cons to driverless cars there is always room for improvement and this generation has plenty of time to improve on that situation.

concluding this I believe having driverless cars would be a tremendous achievement for man kind knowing that we are advancing in the technology that we started off creating and that the driverles car would help millions and contribute to all good beings.
