Some students have trouble in a lot of subjects but are also athletic, so i think it's not fair that you have to have a B average. A student could get an F on a project or test and then their grade can go down, then there automatically off the team? How is that fair? It's easier for a student to maintain a C average than a B average. I think people should have good grades, but a C isn't bad because your still passing that specific class anyways. But i have a stand point of where your coming from, it's a privilege to be in a sport and if you can't show your teachers you can get a good grade in their class, then how do you know your going to be good on the team. There are a lot of athletic kids who get bad grades, but there are some kids that aren't that athletic and get good grades, i don't find that fair that kids that are good at playing the sport can't play because they have a bad grade, school has nothing to do with sports at all.

If the kid is good at playing the sport they should be able to play no matter what their grade is. I don't think it's fair, if the kid is already on the team and he has to get kicked off the team for one bad test grade. Students should be able to play on a team whether they have good grades or not. Grades shouldn't be put against students with athletic.

NO .
