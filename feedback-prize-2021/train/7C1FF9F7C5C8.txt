Dear Principal,

I believe you should consider policy 2 more than policy 1. One of the reasons why you should is because, most students are not going to turn off there cell phones during class time if they know that during lunch and other free times it can be on, and if they know that their phone is on they are going to feel the urge to use it. But with policy 2 the students wouldn't have their phones at all so there wouldn't be a distraction, and if there are no distractions the students would be able to learn more. Another reason why you should pick policy 2 is, because in policy 1 students might want to ditch class in order to get more free time to use their phones, but in policy 2 you don't have your phone so you would have to go to class!

I know most students won't be happy about not being able to bring their phones to school but, I think if you do go with policy 1 you would get a lot more trouble then just going with policy 2. This is what I believe is best for the school, hopefully this helps you make the decision about choosing policy 1 or policy 2.

Sincerely,

Concerned Student
