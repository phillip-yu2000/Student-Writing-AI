In my opinion cell phones should not be used in class at all. If i was the principle of a school i would take up there phones, if was being used in class, and the person who was using the cell phone would get detention. Now if you were using a cell phone at lunch or at other free times in that if it is not disturbing the class it should be fine. For instance, two boys get in a fight, a scrawny weak kid was trying to stand his ground against the bully instead of running to go get help all you have to do is give call on cell phone and then go back up the weak one. If there's school emergency like a fire or something you can call 911 to come stop the incident. In my opinion cell phones could come in handy in certain areas. So i would recommend policy number .
