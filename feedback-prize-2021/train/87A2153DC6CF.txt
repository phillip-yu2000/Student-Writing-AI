Do you think all students should at least participate in one extracurrcalum? Well in my op ion I say they should not because it's not for everybody.

My first reason I have for saying no is it's not for everybody. What I mean by that is not everyone can talk with other people that well. For example a introvert is a person who doesn't really talk or handout with other people. Another example is that if they were bullied and are scared to talk to people who have a bulky built.

My second reason I have is there isn't always a club out there for you. What I'm trying to say by that is there are people out there who just don't like none of the activities. For example one of the activities is sports and most of the boys want to play football or basketball, but I really don't like neither. I also don't like The other sports they have to offer. Anyways out of all of the clubs they have to offer I don't really like any of them.

My last reason I have is why can't we make our own clubs? I know there are some schools out there who won't let their students make their own club. For example say if I wanted to make a video game club, but they won't allow me to make one. Because I said I wanted to play fighting games. So basically What I'm saying is I find it unfair that us students can't make a club.

Now to conclude my paper that had my three reasons which are: Clubs are not for everyone, There is not always a club for the students, and Not being able to make their own clubs.
