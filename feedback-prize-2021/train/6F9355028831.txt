I honestly dont think driverless cars are a good idea. Yes, there are benifits to driverless cars but I personally think there are more disadvantages than advantages. I my self personally like the fact that the driver does not have to drive the car all the time. I think it would be a good idea for handicapped people.

I do not think it is a good idea for many reasons. It states in the article that the cars are eqqipted with a gps, but what if there is a current construction or hazard in the route it takes you? How will the car beable to pass another car on a two lane highway? How about drunk drivers? If a drunk wants to get in a car and drive, that car would allow it, but whenever it is time for the driver to take over, 99.9% of the time that will not happen.

I think there will always be manuel driven cars and trucks around. If someine needs to tow something a driverless car would not be able to tow anything. Farmers, personal buissness' and many other people would have a big issue with this.

Although the world is nearly going to all electronics, mechanics will have to go back to school to learn about these new cars. Most manuel driven cars never have peoblems on the road, because everything is mechanical. Switching everything over to an electronic sensor will mess everyone up. If a laser goes out for surroundings around the car, the driver cannot do anything to help it.

Driverless cars is a bad idea. Drunk drivers will be a huge hazard. Along with many other road hazards. I think it is a good idea for handicapped people, and disabled people.
