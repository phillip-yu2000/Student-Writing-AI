In the article,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the author thinks despite many dangers that Venus has and what Venus is capable of doing, the author thinks it is a worthy persuit. I will give evidence on why I think the author gives good support on his idea.

For example."Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.(P4)" I used this example because it explains how Venus was probably covered with water and most likely supported forms of life and finding out that there was once or still is another form of life on another planet and how there was once an ocean or still is an ocean is fascinting for discovery and a worthy persuit. Another example,"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.(P8)" I used this example because it tells how if we strive hard enough to face and cope with the challanges presented to us by Venus, has a reward which is value like research and inisight of the planet.

In conclusion, I used these examples and explanations above because it shows how the author supports his idea on why persuing the exploration and study of Venus is worthy and could have value to our knowledge.
