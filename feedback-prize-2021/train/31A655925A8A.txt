Cell phones are a big part of our society today, but students have problems with bringing them to school and using them whenever and wherever during class time. If not told when and when not students can use their phones, students will use them at anytime including during class and study time. Policy one is a superior choice because students will be able to bring their phones but only use them during free time, there for putting a halt to interruptions during class time. This way students can actually learn and are not worried about texting friends in the middle of class. If you also take them away during study time students can study for a big test they have coming up that week.

If policy two was implemented students would ignore the rule and bring and hide them anyways. Students would not pay attention because they are too busy trying to hide the fact they have a cell phone out during class time. Study time would no longer be "studying time" and it would change to "texting time". Students do not always follow instructions, of course you will have some that do, but a majority of them will blow it off and do whatever they like.

Both of these policies are good choices however, more people would follow instructions if policy one was used, of course not everybody will follow directions, but a majority will. Policy one is the better choice for principals and students. That way everybody gets what they want.
