Where do i stand on the development of Driverless Cars? Eh, they could be useful. But then again, still very dangerous. You have to be a very responsible person to handle one of these vehicles though. My concern is the individual driving the vehicle, or maybe another person whose very smart but jealous of the person who has this cool new car.

The person driving can't expect the car to just drive it automatically home from work or something. What if a person falls asleep behind the wheel because they thinks its fine for just one time? There are some things that do not need to be created for human usage because some people dont know how to handle things, which ruin it for others.

Now the crazy jealous techno Wiz. Your neighbo,r or somebody could hack into your car's system and make it do things you dont want. They could probably control where you're going, make you randomly crash, drive you off the highway, ANYthing. People are crazy, and know how to hack into just about anything they set their minds to. The car ITSELF might have a malfunction & end up killing you.

In conclusion, I dont belive the driverless cars are a good idea anymore. We have enough technology that should keep us content. The people creating this should be using the money for more important things.
