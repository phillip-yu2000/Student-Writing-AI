How do you feel about this new technology? Many people feel that this technolgy will not work but some people think it will. My opinon would be i think it would becasue that just how my self saw and read the artical. it says that the facial ecpresstions for each emotion are universal observes Dr. huang. even though individals often show varying degrees of expression

The first thing im going to talk about is going to be the way they people look at this new technolgy. In the expert i saw that alot of people are starting to like this new technolgy and people are changing there mind about it. Another fact is a classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confuced or of task. i think that would be awesome for me becasue i have a hard time focosing in class.

The second thing im going to talk about would be what is the new techoligy about. Its new because you can see if a student is getting off task or hard to stay focussed. People like it because they will get help if they are confused and with out it the stuent wont ask and they ill just stay there confused the hole time and not know anything. I think that new tchonoly would be good for alot of students so i would reconmend it to alot of school across the USA.

Many people should like this for there kid. it will help them so much and make your kid a way better student. i think that technoley is super cool and reconmend it everywhere. Theres students that are failing classes and not asking for help but they need it and if the teacher has a little devise and they can see whos confused they will help them
