Do you want to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? The Seagoing Cowboys program is a good "opportunity of a lifetime". Its a good opportunity to learn how to be responsible such as" taking care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas".

So Luke Bomberger learned a lot from not ever going overseas before.

The Seagoing program is educational because according to Lukes adventure he learned a lot about taking care of animals, and learning that

"World War ll was over in Europe, and many other countries were left in ruins".

So I could say that Luke probably was interested in many different things and he probably had fun learning them. According to the article it sounds like Luke was very anxiuos when his friend Don Reist invited him to go to Europe with him on a cattle boat. When Don Reist invited him he kinda sounded like he was kinda confused when Don said cattle boat but then I think he thought that it would be a perfect opportunity to learn or see what is would be like.

You should go try the Seagoing program! It can be a very exciting experience if you have never tried it or even heard of it before. I also think you can learn many different events that havehappened overseas, such as visiting it to see what it looks likes if you live far or just seeing where World War ll was hield at. I also think it could be very interesting to just see what happened or if theres something there from World War ll. So you should go and visit Europ e on a cattle boat just to see how interesting or what you see that you dont see around where you live.
