Good advice can be hard to find. People tend to ask a few members of their family or friends for advice. Why do they do that exactly? Well here is why.

Have you ever asked for advice from someone and then use the advice you got? It could be good, but It could also be bad. You could feel betrayed by the fact that someone trusted could've given you bad advice, but maybe they just couldn't relate to the situation you were in. That could lead you to the next question," Then why didn't they be honest about the fact that they didn't have the best advice you needed". Well maybe, they just wanted to help because they care. Maybe they just want to grow a deeper connection between the two of you. Whatever the reason is, you shouldn't just seek important advice from one specific person unless you really trust them.

Well, if you shouldn't just ask one person for advice, then you should ask many right? Wrong! You can't just ask any random person about advice for your problems. You should always ask members of your family or your trusted friends. Maybe they won't always have the best advice for you which is why you can ask the next person. I myself am religious, so I often pray to the Lord. I find peace in the mind that way, so I then find my own advice. But no matter who it is you should always multiple people for advice because once you have, you decide on what is the best advice for you and hopefully it is the advice that works out in your favor. If it is the correct advice, the connection between you and that person is strong.

Asking a few people for advice is a great thing because friends and family are supposed to be there for you when you are in need. And when you get all the advice you need, don't be too hasty to make decisions. Instead, think it over because advice can determine friendships, relationships, tough decisions, and more. Think hard because there will probably be no turning back.
