Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have a complaint I have a grade C average and I would like to play sports and I'm a great athlete and you can ask the couches. The couches had ask me to play sports but then they did not know that i need a B average to play sport. I really think u should change that policy because there are a lot of good sports player but they cant play because they have a grade C average. I don't think you want this school remember as the worst player in all the sports. So if you don't want to here all the nonsense from the students and from the couches so the best thing to do is change that policy. Most people are really upset so am I, but if you don't change I am pretty positive that no one will go to this school anymore and once we leave this school you will be closed down
