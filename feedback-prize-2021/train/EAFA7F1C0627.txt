There are some schools that offer distance schooling. If students do online or video conferencing they dont truly benefit attending classes from home. Students have an increase of slacking, cheating, and a problem of personally asking a teacher for help. Meaning, theres cons on online schooling.

While being home in bed still learning may seem like fun, there's a chance of students starting to slack. Being a student takes determination on having school work due on time and paying attention to the education you're receiving. Having online schooling may make you believe you have a lot of free time on your hands, causing no time to do your school work. When students don't have time to do work and still need work done they start to cheat. There's no problem with cheating while having online school because there's no teacher to stop you.

Cheating on your school work is a horrible action. It shows that you weren't paying attention. Cheating is something easy to do while having online classes. If you're copying all work needed to be done, you truly don't learn the education you need to move forward with school. That's a major problem while being a student. A reason why students may cheat on online classes may be because they don't have a teacher to ask for help, unless you have the video conferencing school.

A downfall for online school is not having a teacher personally there for you when you need help. Going to public school you can easily raise your hand and a teacher would come to help with your assistance. Having this problem may be the cause of the slacking and cheating. When not having help from a teacher who knows what they're teaching is when students go to their other solutions.

In conclusion, cheating, slacking, and personally not being able to ask a teacher for help are major problems with online schooling. Students don't benefit and really understand the education given to them while having the chance of online classes.
