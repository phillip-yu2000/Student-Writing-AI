Joining the Seagoing Cowboys progam can benefit recovering countries and yourself. If you enjoy helping people in need and traveling the world then you'll want to sign up for this progam. Some reasons why you should the program ar being aware of other countries and their needs,experiencing several countries' history and culture, and helping ruined countries.

In paragraph two, the passage explains that many countries were left in ruins after World War two. It states,"To help countries recover their food suppliers, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). UNRRA hired "Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

In paragraph nine it said that it opened up the world to me. I stated "It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. It stated that the awareness stayed with me and it lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. In paragraph five, I stated," The cattle-boat trips were an unbelieveale oppurtunity for a small-town boy," I also said,"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special." In the passage I said ."So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water." I also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canalo on my way back to China. I had the privilage of traveling around the world and experiencing different cultures and several coutries' history.

In conclusion, I believe that you and many ruined countries will benefit from this progam. It is something that you will always remember and will stick with you throughout you're life. You will also benefit from it greatly for many reasons that I have already stated before hand.
