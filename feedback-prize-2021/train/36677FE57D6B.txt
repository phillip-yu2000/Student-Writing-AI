I disagree with the principal because. Students have homework and doing activities can get them stressed about school. Also some students have to take care of there siblings. Sometimes something important happens and your not home because your doing after school activities.

Student have homework and doing after school activities. They dont have time to do home work and they an be failing a class. And failing a class can get you kicked out of the activity your in. And when your failing a classes you can get held back a grade and that will go in your record.

Some students have to take of there siblings. Because there parents are working and there is no one home to take care of them. Maybe your baby brother is choking on a toy and your not home to save the baby . Maybe your parents went on a business trip and they will not come back for a week there is no time for after school activities you have to cook for them take them to the park.

Maybe something important happened at you house and your not home. If your mom is a single mom and she has a medical condion and something happens to her. You are not home because you have after school activities. You had to go somewhere after school but you forgot and you go to you after school activities and you remember when you on the way home but you know its to late.
