Are you looking for a fun and awsome opportunity? Well you have come to the right place. Here at the UNRRA, we need help, your help!

Here at the UNRRA you can do lots of things to help different countires. Such as being a Seagoing Cowboy. Retired Seagoing Cowboys have a special message to you.

"Hi! I'm Luke. I am a retiered Seagoing Cowboy. It all started the day my friend asked me to go to Europe with him. In 1945

my friend Don(also a retiered Seagoing cowboy) signed us up for the journey. I know what you are probably asking, Luke what do Seagoing Cowboys do? We get on ships and help take care of horses and cattle on the way to countries in need. Being a Seagoing Cowboy is amazing, not only because you get to help people and different countries, but you get to see different places and things. For example, I have seen Europe and China form doing this. I have also seen the Acropolis in Greece and taken a godola ride in Venice, Italy. It does take a lot of time to be a Seagoing Cowboy, but it is so worth it. I am filled with gratitude for the opportunity. It made me more aware of people and other counrtries. I now host a number of international students and exchange visitors."

I hope you enjoyed that message from Luke. I aslo hope it inspired you to join the UNRRA.
