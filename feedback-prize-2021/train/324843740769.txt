I disagree with the principal in saying every student should do a extracurricular activity for three reasons.

One reason I disagree is because not everyone has the time to do these activities. Like some students might have younger siblings to take care of or afterschool jobs they have to do, such as walking dogs, babysitting, tutoring, and other things. Also some students have responsibilities to do when they get home, maybe they have an elderly person at home, and its their responsibility to take care of that person as soon as school ends.

Second reason why i disagree is, students should be able to choose whether or not they want to do the extracurricular activity. It shouldn't be up to the principal, because the school might not have the sport or the club a student might be interested in. Not every student enjoys sports, clubs or people in general, so they would think this new rule is unfair and that the principal should've asked them how they felt about it before coming up with this rule.

My last reason for disagreeing with the principal is that some students might have a curfew or a time that they should be home by afterschool. Extracurricular activities take at least an hour or two, and lets say the school day ends at 3:45 and your staying afterschool for a club and that club takes two hours, and the bus ride is thirty minutes, which means you'll get home sometime after six. Your parents might tell you that you should've been home an hour ago, then you'll get in trouble, so for some students extracurricular activities aren't for them.

This is why i disagree with the principal, next time I hope they keep the students in mind before they make a new school rule or if they had talked to the students before making a decision.
