Dear, principal

I don't think it is a good idea to change the grade point average that is required to participate in sports.

Some of the players would get kicked off the team because they just have a C and that could effect the whole team.

It could also effect your school because maybe the players are just so stressed from having to try to get a B instead of just a C.

A C is still a good grade.

A C is still passing and it shows that the person may not understand but he still try's.

When I get a C its because I tried but i don't quite understand the information.

I know a lot of kids that would be happy with just a C and they actually try in class.

My friend was on the basketball team and he got decent grades.

I remember that when projects came up he would be really stressed and I would help him out with his school work.

He would try but on certain things he felt like it was just way to hard.

Imagine if he had to get B' s, he would have been all stressed all the time and it was hard for him to just to get good enough grades just to be able to play a sport that he really loved.

Some kids are stressed and they don't really have to get grades good enough to play any sport.

I try for good grades and its easy because I have all the time after school to do my homework or maybe just work on a project that will be due.

The players on the team have to go to practice and then after that they do there homework but I would think they would be tired from having to practice for about on hour.

When I am tired I don't always do my best and that could effect grades.

The players have a lot to handle and raising what grades they have to have in order to play ,may just make them quit.

It sucks when you have to quit something you love just because its way to hard to keep balance.

If you raise the grade point average it will tip the balance and make it hard to be a basketball player.

Please don't change the grade point average.

Sincerely
