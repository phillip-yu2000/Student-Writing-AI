I am in favor of policy number one. Being a teenager I enjoy using my cell phone. And are we really hurting anyone by using our phones during lunch or free time? I didn't think so. Not being able to bring our phones at all could actually be a safety hazard . What if a child, who has breathing issues, needs their medicine, and they left it at home? What if that same child didn't have their parents' numbers memorized? How would that child be able to contact their parents?

Now, people break the rules all the time. If an adult tells a teen not to do something what do you think we're going to do? That's right the exact opposite. We aren't stupid, we know what's good and bad. But we hate being told what to do. And isn't being told what to do and when to do it a form of bullying? Yes it is. If we are allowed to use our cell phones when we aren't in our classes there wouldn't be a problem. If we aren't allowed to use them, we'll just break the rule and do it anyway. I know it sounds bad, but it's true. No matter what the rules are, us teenagers will use our phones.

Can't we just use our phones without worrying that we'll be suspended or put in detention? Why is it such a big deal if we use our phones anyway. Teachers use them all the time. Just last week my substitute for history spent the entire class time texting his girlfriend. If we can't use our phones, why can the teachers? My history teacher, TEACHER_NAME, is always talking about equal rights, fair treatment, and how everyone should follow the same set of rules. But halfway into the class her phone would ring, and she would be texting or talking for the rest of the class time. The teachers don't follow the rules, so why should we? The teachers always have their phones out. Why can't we? We're teens, we will use our phones. Saying we can or can't, won't make a difference. We love our cell phones, and we are good at hiding them.
