Dear, Principal

I think the new B

average participation rule would be great for most kids, because there are a lot of kids that are smart but don't apply themselves. Most kids think they can goof off and they still get the privileges as the other kids that actually work for the stuff they obtain.

Kids like to just mess around and not understand what it is there actually learning. Then when it comes test time they don't know what it is there doing. When the get homework they don't do it because they don't think it can effect them.

There are many kids that think all they'll need to do is pass with a D, and that they will move on but a D is only saying that they have the basics down, and they don't fully understand it. If they want to get into a good school they are going to have to start applying themselves.

If there is a grade cap on most school activities students will start working harder. The activities should only be for people that apply themselves and work hard so they can get into a good school and get the rewards they deserve.

Principle these are the reasons why we need a grade cap on school activities. So kids could work for what they earn. There's just to many kids who think they can get by in life with just a D or C for a grade.
