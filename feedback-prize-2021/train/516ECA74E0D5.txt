Dear Editor,

Since there is going to be a new change policy in our school, I highly recommended for you not to change the participation in sports. I think that participation in any sports activity after school is good for your health and your brain. The reason why I'm saying this is because people may love sports and they can't live without it. Also playing sports after school is good for meeting new friends and socializing. If the student is not doing so good in school the student may want to be offered tutoring on there weak subject. So if this policy is going to change the student may pick up their grades and get too play in a after school sport. For those kids who are a honor student and get to play sports I think that it wouldn't be fair to those kids who cant play sports. If a student isn't aloud to play a sport after school, wouldn't it be the same thing if they played for a sports team outside of school for a league. Also it just wouldn't be the kids that would be upset, it would be the coaches too. The coaches that love the sport that they want to coach for, but they find out that not a lot of young students are going to be playing with them. As you can see to change this new policy in schools for sports, kids would be very upset with the board of education and yourself.
