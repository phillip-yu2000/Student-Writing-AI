Dear State Senator,

I am writing to you to tell you that we should change to popular vote because for one there is less likely to be a dispute over the popular vote rather than an Electoral College. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012's election, for example, Obama recieved 61% of the electoral vote compared to only 51% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney.

The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of ir are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tigth races in the "swing" states.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. theres a thing called the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system allows for much worse.

The electoral college systems has lots of flows and is way too outdated. We should switch to popular vote and life will be easier.

Sincerely,

Julia
