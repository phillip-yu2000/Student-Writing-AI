I think we should have phone at school because are parents need to be In touch with us after school if some kids did not have phone are parents wouldn't no if we need to ride the bus go to car rider line or walk. and I think that we can take are phones out during lunch because at free time we have nothing else to do and that's are time to do what ever we want.

teachers can't take are phones if we are at lunch or if we are having free time.

And it is not far if the teachers can pull out there phones during class and at lunch and we can't, if the kids can't pull out there phones then they can't either.

I wonder why can't take out are phones during lunch were not in class, lunch is are free time that should not be a rule we should pull are phones out at lunch because that is are free time.
