The use of technology for facial expressions of students would be very useful beacsue the teacher can tell if a student does not like the lesson or is bored. The computers could tell how students feel towards the class to see if they are enjoying the class or not. If the computers can read facial expressions they could help make the lessons better for the students and maybe they will actually learn something useful. The use of technolgy to read emotions and expressions of students in a class room is a great idea becasue it could help give teachers a better way to teach the students.

In todays world technolgy is very useful and a face scanning system to tell emotions would be a great thing to have. With something like this you could tell how someone is feeling without even talking to them. The face scanning application could however get things wrong and make the wrong asuption of how someone is feeling. The face scanning application could work to help people undertand how someone if feeling but could be very wrong at the same time.
