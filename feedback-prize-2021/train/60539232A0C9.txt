Why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. People ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person let me tell you why.

For example, people ask for advises all the time; because each persons has a different experience. You can ask older people or adults about thier experiences. That might help you make the right choice. In addition, you can ask your mom, dad, and grandparents and thier person you can really trust. You can ask them questions maybe that will help with what ever problem you are going through. Another thing you can do is to confess with an adult. About your problems. A person that you really trust.

On the other hand, in school you can also ask for advice. Your counselor is a person that can give you really good advises that can help you. It's a person that you can let all your feelings out. Teachers can also give you an advice or an experience they have had in life. For example, I have a teacher that I trust and when I need her she is always there for me. Your principal or administrators can give you opinions. They can also help you when you are in a bad condition. I think hearing different advises and experiences can help you a lot.

Finally, in church you can ask your pastors for advice so you can make a proud choice. Even reading the bible can help you. For example, I always put God first no matter what. I think my knowledge is more mature. When I make a decision I ask God give me the right of understanding things. I prey an ask God questions I know he hears me. He protects me from all the bad things. I know if I do something wrong God still loves me and you. He will always be there when you need him. No matter what the people say God dosen't think that of you. He knows you can do better. God loves you God bless you.

In conclusion, these are ways that can help you with life. I don't know if it helps you but helps me. And I say it one more time God loves you.
