Phones and Driving

Cellphones are becoming some people's addiction to the point they risk there life just to text. I think the only way you should be able to use your phone and drive is if your handsfree using it. Calling and music should be the only thing you should be able to do. There is no excuse to risk your life or anyone else's life just for a text message.

People are way too caught in their phone that they need to put it up when they drive. Georgia has passed a law stating your phone can not be touching you when in your vehicle. You may not even make a phone call unless your car has the hands-free option. I honestly think this is the perfect for people. It helps control people and make roads safer.

I believe you should be able to listen to your music on your phone when driving and even make calls, but texting should be off limits. You have to look at your phone to long and take your eyes off the road which is extremely unsafe this should be reason enough not to do such things.

In conclusion, its simple to not text and drive because you're safer you could just listen to your music or if you really need to tell someone something you could just make a call to them instead and be a whole lot easier and safer.
