Dear principal,

I think that phones are mandatory for someone to carry around with them at all times; otherwise, what's the point of having a phone?

Let's say there is an emergency at school. A student is having a stroke in the bathroom, and no one is around to help him. If the student has a cell phone then he can just dial 911 and get sent to the ER. However, if he doesn't have a phone; survival percentages are very slim. The school will then get sued and lose a lot of money. Everybody knows that principals hate their students, but all care about money. That is the main reason phones should be allowed at school; just in case.

There are also cons to letting students hold phones in school. Last year, every single one of my classmates used a phone or an i-touch sometime during the year; everyone except for me. That is because my parents are very strict Asians and I won't get a phone or a girlfriend until sometime in college. Phones really are a pest towards concentration, nobody paid any attention at all during History class at all. (Then again, everyone hated the teacher, the class was boring, and half the people were sleeping.) Still, the whole phone scandal thing is still a huge problem. Right now, one of my friends still uses his phone every single hour of the day; and he still gets all A' s.

I really don't think phones are a problem at school because most of the people that use them have very good grades. People who don't pay attention in all their classes (me, cell phone users) still ace the subject. (Even though I'll have to pay attention in high school.) Cell phone are not a distraction in class they are just a fun little device to get one's mind off things. I can still listen to my teacher blabbing on while I watch my friend texting.

To recapitulate all this, I think that cell phones should be allowed in schools if there is an emergency, for boredom, and to annoy others by spamming them with text.
