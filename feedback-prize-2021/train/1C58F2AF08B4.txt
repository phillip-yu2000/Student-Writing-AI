Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Many people are doing community service. In my opinion students should be required to have community service. It is a great way to show support to your community. This could help students to become better people. Cleaning litter could help the environment.

The first reason for community service is that it will support the community. Most people would feel like doing the right thing. It would probably be less crime. For example helping others could change someone's mind set. They'd feel as though they had a purpose which is to help.

Second of all, it helps students become better people. Helping the community can become a habit. Tutoring a student can change their future. They can become successful one day. The person you taught might recognize you for their success.

Finally, cleaning litter can help the environment. For example cleaning around the school makes it more presentable. It also leaves a good feeling that you have done something great. It shows leadership and character. This could come in handy one day.

In conclusion, Other students are doing community service to show support. It can may students better people. The environment is bettered when cleaning up litter. This shows character.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
