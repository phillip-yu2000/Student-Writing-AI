If you are looking into joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, their are lots of great reasons to join.

The first reason that the program is great is because you get to help people that are in need! Another one of the reasons, out of many, is that you would maybe get to see Europe and Greece. Even if you don't see those places, you defindely get to see Greece! "' Seeing the Acropolis in Greese was special."' I said. '"So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."' I supported. I also got to see the Panama Canal on my way to China.

You also get to care and help animals. You get to feed the animals, water them, and the stalls have to be cleaned. Even if this is not your favorite thing to do, you are still helping animals! Just like you need care, animals also need care, so it is a very kind thing to do.

You also get to play games, and have lots of fun! The games I played were baseball, volleyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. I added in my article that, "games also help pass time." That is very true! I loved playing games on board!

In conclusion, I got to learn lots of things about people who need help, and also animals. I stated in my article, "' It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."' I also ended up leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. this trip was a great experience.
