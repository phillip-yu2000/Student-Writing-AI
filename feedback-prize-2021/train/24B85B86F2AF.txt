Think that it would be a great idea to participate in this program because you will get to vist and see so many beautiful places and you will have many great experiences. On paragraph 5 is tells you that this opportunity for a small town boy was unbelivable besides helping people he was able to see Europe and China. One of the best parts is that you wont have to work all the time becuase in paragraph 8 it says that they had fun activities to help pass the time. This great oppertunity opened lukes eyes to the world and the people around it. If you are planning on doing this then i think you should do it because it is such a great oppernunity.

In paragraph 9 luke sayes that being a seagoing cowboy was much more then an adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world for him. If you are planning on being a seagoing boy imagine all the places and people you will be able to meet. You will be able to see so many different coultures and how other people live. Would'nt that sound like so much fun it would be an adveture you will never forget.

Imagine being 18 and traveling around the world. Not every 18 year old gets the oppertunity to travel to Greece or China or Europe. Now that would be great. Traveling at a yound age. Teengers now these days are always stuck on there phones instead of going outsude and enjoy the fresh air. Take this oppertunity you wont regret it. Luke didnt.
