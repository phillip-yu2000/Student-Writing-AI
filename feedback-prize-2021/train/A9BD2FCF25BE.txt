Have you ever been torn between multiple things to say or do? I have, but I went to my family for the help I needed. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present.

Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. In order to make the best decision, you must go to the people you trust the most: your family. Family is always there for you, even when life seems at it's lowest. Asking the younger members in your family for advice might not be the brightest choice to make, but going to your elders is the best possible choice to make while seeking advice. Looking up to your elder family members is the best thing you can do when seeking opinions because, they have the most knowledge about how to act socially, and you know that you can fully trust them with what you're telling them. An instance where your elders come in, is what to say and when. Almost all teenagers have been made fun of or been in some form of drama and, they don't know what to say back to the bullies. That's where your elders come in. Your elders already know what it's like to feel that way, so they understand greatly. They give you multiple opinions and options to choose from when confronting the bullies. Many teenagers, including me have successfully stood up to bullies after talking with elder family members.

Let's face it, we've all had to face some terrifying situations and, we didn't know what to do. But we all have our families to guide us to make the right choices. Seeking multiple opinions to motivate you on choosing the best decision is a vital role in making good choices because, those opinions can help you somewhat predict the outcome of the situation present. Next time that you're being faced with a challenge, go to your family. They will support you no matter what.
