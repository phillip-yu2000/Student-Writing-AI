Technology that can be used to tell how we are feeling has many uses. Using technology like this would have plenty of benefeits, but there is a good argument to be made against it. The benefeits of emotion recognition technology in th eclass room do not outweigh the cost of it.

Technology that can recognize emotions in a class room could be used to help students who are bored or confused. The ability to tell when someone is bored or lost is a very valuable tool for a teacher. This would change everything about how we learn. That is the problem. We could change a system that has put people on the moon.

The school system we have right now works to educate people very well. Changing our system in such an extreme manor would have equally extreme consequences. We may fail to educate the generation this is tried on, or we may fail to make people as strong as they are now.

Another problem is privacy. This technology would take away any hope of hiding ones feelings. If I am angry at a classmate and this technology tells the teacher, then everyone could be forced into a situation no one wants to be in. We have the freedom of speech and the right to remain silent. This technology would force us to share more than we might want. This could destroy relationships within schools hamper eduaction.

Another factor that must be considered is cost. How much would it be for one student to have one? Howmuch for all the students? Many schools struggle to provide learning materials and having risky technology that costs so much could limit a tight budget even more.

Technology that can read emotions is valuable and has many uses. In a school, the benefiets do not outweigh the costs. Privacy and risk in using new techniques amongst with the amount of money needed to buy the technology far outweight the possibility that it could slightly improve a working system. In conclusion, this technology should not be brought into schools.
