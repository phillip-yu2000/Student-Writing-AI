Policy 2

Bringing your cell phone to school is just a stupid thing to do. For some reasons its will get you in trouble if you get caught with it out during class, and you will loose focus on what you are learning or what your doing.

Lots of kids get in trouble for using their cell phone during class . Students are either texting someone or talking to someone on their phones in class. Teachers just take your phone away until the end of the period. So after the period the student can just do it again in the next period. I think teachers should keep it for the rest of the day so they don't do it again.

If you texting someone during a test, quiz, or worksheet you will loose focus on what you are doing. Eventually you will be getting bad grades and then you will be in trouble be your parents for getting the bad grades. Before you know it you'll haft to take your grades over again.

Cell phone lead to alot of trouble so please take my word on reconsidering the school's cell phone policy for it is just a wait of time in the students in our school!
