Driverless cars has been something that the movies have glorified and try to make popular. Driverless cars could be useful of you start to get lost or tired but your safety and well being is going to be at risk.

Driving is something that you can never be too careful about wether it is reckless driving, an animal running out into the road, or construction gone wrong. Today there are alot of dangers that come along with driving and that make it more dificuly for drivers to commute safetly.

Everything has it's pros and cons but in this situation there are more cons than pros. With a car that has a mind of its own you can never be too careful when it comes to your safety and well being and making sure you and everyone around you will be safe. First of all the cars will drive on their own and that might make you very tired and cause you to start to fall asleep, but the cars haven't been able yo drive through road damage, wrecks and there are alot of those everywhere and if your asleep you cant assist your car through the damage.

Driverless cars are most likely to be really small and in a small car you are more likely to get hurt in the case of a wreck.

There will be people to drive these cars but the car won't be a household car it will be the type of car that celebrities drive around and the price will probabily be through the roof.

Personally I dont think these cars would be a solid investment just for the simple fact its un realistic. There will be a select few to buy them but most of them will stick to the manual driving.
