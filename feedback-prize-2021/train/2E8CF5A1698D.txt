We need to stop having electoral colleges its unfair and really out of date most poeple dont even see a campaighn with electoral votes. If we were to change to popular voting then we could have everyone involved in the voting and it would be fair voting and desisions for everyone who is involved. When your in a electoral vote you are not voting for a president but for a slate of electors.

It is not fair for state legislatures to pick our electors thats why we had the big fiasco back in 2000. The government basically has full control over the who really gets the win of the vote if we stay in the elactoral vote system they have free reighn on what electors to send to congress on whom ever they agree with. In a electoral vote bigger states gets the most attention from presedental campaighns and a smaller state wouldnt get any attention at all to the campaighn In electoral votes they have toss up states which are states that will pay the campaighn very close attention which basically means they choose who wins because their known as thoughtful voters.

The reason we should do away with the electoral system and out in the popular system is because it is alot more easy to get involved with and you have control over whose president and the elevtors not the government. We have the right to pick our presedints and congress so we should do it right and in a fair way.
