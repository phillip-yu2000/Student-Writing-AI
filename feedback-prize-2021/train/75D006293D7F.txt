Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that policy two is the best choice. Students shouldn't be allowed to have cell phones in school at all. If you allowed them to use them during breaks, they would have them all the time. This includes during tests, in locker rooms, and during other important parts of class. If a student had their phone with them during class, they might think, "Hey, I have it with me anyways, I might as well use it". If this happened they could cheat on tests, distract other students, and send inappropriate photos to their friends. Students only want to use their phones during a boring lecture when they'd rather be talking to their friends. During breaks and lunch, they can talk to their friends in person, so there's no point in using a phone. The only way to stop students from using cell phones in class, is to not allow them in the school at all. There have been times, during class, when someone's cell phone has rung, and gotten everybody off task. The teacher stopped teaching and had to take the phone from the student. And all the kids started whispering about who's phone it was and why it rang. It ends up taking fifteen or twenty minutes to get everything sorted out. By that time the teacher forgot what they were talking about and the students were acting like animals in a zoo. Also, there have been cases where students have had their cell phone in the locker room and decided that it would be a good time to take an inappropriate picture and send it to their boyfriend or girlfriend. The only way to stop things like this and other things, like getting answers from a friend on the biggest test of the year, is to not allow cell phones in school at all. I

hope you agree with what I believe and make the right decision.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
