Are you guys bored at home and you got nothing to do? Join our program.

First, our program is about Seagoing Cowboys. A Seagoing Cowboys is a program that you take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. A Seagoing Cowboys is like a adventure that you ever had.

Next, sign up are in Europe and this boy Luke sign up. He was having a life time on his adventure. He went to Panama Canal and Crete and China. Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II.

Then, it takes him two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean to get to China. Luke was busy the whole time. Be care full when working because one rainy night Luke slid down a slippery ladder on his backside, but he is still alive. He also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games and table-tennis tournament, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time.

Last, it was a open world for him. He had fun sometimes when his group are done with empty holds where animals had been housed. So join now to become a Seagoing Cowboys.
