Dear Principal: I think we should have cell phones during lunch periods and other free times because, it will give us a chance to talk to our other friends in different classes. We shouldn't have our cell phones on in class because it will distract you from listening to instructions. When you don't listen to instructions or what the teacher is telling you, you won't learn the material for the day. Cell Phones should only be used for emergencies only because certain teens don't know how to use during free time. For example, if you don't bring your phone to school how would your parent know if you're doing extra stuff after school. If your parents don't know then they will get worried about if you are safe or not. In some ways it's important to have a cell phone. During lunch time and free time that's the time to take out your phone because when you take it out in class when you're not supposed to, your phone gets taken away and your mad at the teacher for your mistake. If your going to have a phone just know how to use the phone in your free time and whenever an adult in school tells you to use it. Having your phone on during class is distracting because if you forgot to turn down the ring volume and it goes off in class, your phone will probably get taken away by your teacher.

Only use the phone when you need to if you are texting your parents then that's one thing if you're texting your friends you see them any way at lunch or in class.

Using a phone in school is a privilege because you have to ask your teacher or you have to wait until you have lunch or free time. Allowing kids to bring phones to school and use them is a big responsibility, and to use them during free time and during lunch is the only time to use them.
