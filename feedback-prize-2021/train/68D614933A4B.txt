The future technologies are improving, and the driverless car becomes popular these days. People dream about driving without the driver; car of course, taxi, bus, train, and air plane. It can bring us convenience. A lot of companies already started working on their driverless vehicles project, it will take huge part of the market in the future.

Driverless car can lead our future technology. It seems useful and practical. However, everything has their pros and cons, so does driverless car. In my opinion, driverless car can't driving without the driver, but it can help drivers drive easily and safely. Here is my articles to support my opinion.

First, it can ruin people's job. A lot people make money from working in the transportation company, if driverless car gets popular, nobody will need a taxi driver or a bus driver anymore. Pilots of trains and planes will no longer needed as well. It is hard to get a job these days even if you graduate the decent college, the driverless car will make this worse.

Second, the sensors and auto systems can help the drivers to drive, but it can't control all process of driving. Sometimes the computer doesn't work properly as our desktops or laptops do, it can cause errors any time. Sometimes driving needs human's ability, especial it's a sudden situation.

Third, the problem of responsibility. For example, if your driverless car hits the person in front of you, it is ambiguous to figure out who has the responsible for the accident. The car company, and the customers will argue to blame each other.

Driverless car can bring convenience to us. It seems very helpful, but it also has obivous problems. People are improving technologies right now at this time as well. But the important thing is people should think more carefully of pros and cons of the future technologies rather than just chasing the benefit in front of them.
