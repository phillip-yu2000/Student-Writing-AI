Driverless cars are a futuristic dream for many people. But now that they are becoming a reality some people support driverless cars and some do not support driverless cars. Driverless cars can be dangerous and could fail and hurt someone. Driverless cars should not be sold or used until they fix the danger involved. Making them safe for the public to drive.

Danger is a big worry to the world, understandably to because many people die in automotive accidents. Some beleive that driverless cars can solve that danger involved in driving. But in truth it could be more dangerous than a human driving. The technology involved in everyday life can be troublesome and does not want to work all the time, so the technology involved in driverless cars could easily behave the same way. Most people have had a problem with their wifi or their phone acting up and not working before. The technology in driverless cars could just as easily do the same thing, and that could indanger millions of people.

Driverless cars take away human control and human error, but it gives control to technology and computers, in turn giving way to technology errors. Many people dont want their families getting hurt do to a technology error when they could of had control and been fine. Human control is very important when talking about families and friends. So until they can be absolutly sure the technology wont fail and can maintain control driverless cars should not be driven for everyday use.
