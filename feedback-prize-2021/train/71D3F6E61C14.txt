Dear Principle,

I would recommend using ''Policy 1'',because students bring their phone to school anyways.

If you do allow students to use their phone at school at free times they would like school a lot more. Especially teens they would love the fact that they can use their phones at school during a free time. A lot of students today get in trouble for bringing their phone to school.

There are some good reasons for students to bring their phones to school. Here's three examples, example one,

they might for get their gym clothes, so they'll wait until a free time to call their parents to drop their clothes off. Example two, a student might get hurt at school and no one is around, all they'll have to do is pull out their cell phones and call their parents . Example three, A student might stay after school for tryout's or something and didn't tell their parents. Instead of having their parent worried sick about them they can call them and tell them where they are.

If you use policy 2 students will bring them anyways. The more trouble students get in , the more work you'll have to do. So let them bring there phones to school. They'll love it! If you do allow them to bring there phones to school they'll text there friends and tell them about it, Then there friends are going to move to your school. The more students you have at your school the better. So please let your students take there phones to school.

Sincerely yours,
