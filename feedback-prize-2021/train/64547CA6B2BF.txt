People should try to be Seagoing Cowboys because you get to save the lives of animals that have been injured during the World War II. I was in it and it was just great to be able to help all of those horses. It can get hard somwtimes but it is still great. You also have a bettere communication with the animals and get to meet new people. Sometimes when you have free time you can go visit the beautiful sites! It is a very busy job and you get tired a loy. Sometimes you have to watch the animals every hour to make sure they're safe. You wouldn't want them to escape and get hurt!

Helping all of those animals can really open up your mind and see how much some animals are suffering. It is great that there are programs like this that can help so many animals. It is a great adventure to go on and it is very fun! If you get bored on the boat you can go play some games like we did like volleyball or table tennis or anything you can think of! It is a very wonderful experience. Something wonderful as that could only come once in a life time. So i encourage you to become a Seagoing Cowboy and save the lives of many animals like me!
