A claim that evaluates the author idea is... No matter how hard they try and study about the Venus and learn how to land there safetly, its still going to be a dangrous. like every time u send some one there to study, the spacecraft cant land for a hours and they get in danger. The author kinda want people to just give it up. no matter what you do, Venus will be Venus. In the article it says "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation". Venus is a earth twin but u should never dream to go there. There is no spacecraft that survive landing in Venus. In the article it says "No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours". The spacecraft cant survive it because the Venus is so hot. NASA is working on other approaches to studing Venus. They be sending people to Venus just to study Venus. They are trying harder and harder. They are now using some old technology called mechanical computers to study Venus. The mechanical computers were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War ll. NASA wont give up on studying Venus. People didnt know what Venus is before. Back then, Venus was coverd by tree and and mountains just like the earth. Now you can see it at the night time. Venus is called the " Evening Star,". It is one of the brightest light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. The Venus is the dangrous planet that u should never go. No spacecraft servived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA is working very hard to study about the Venus and maybe wanna map everything on it. Venus is the "Evening star," that u can see it at night time. People who wants to study about Venus are now using old mechanical Computers.
