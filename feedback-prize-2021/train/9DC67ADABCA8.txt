I think all students should perform community service. It is good to give back to the community. It gives us so much. For example, a house to sleep in, a schools to go to learn in, and grocery stores to buy food in.

If each student can give back a little bit of time out of their day or weekend, our society would be a nice and clean place to live in. If people didn't do community service, our society would be a dump. there would be trash every where. It wouldn't be safe for children and baby's.

Or the students could help at a soup kitchen or tutor younger children in elementary school. It would be better for the younger children so they can get a better education and succeed. At the soup kitchen, students could serve meals to homeless people and the less fortunate.

In my conclusion, I think it would be best if it was required to perform community service. Everyone would feel better about themselves if they helped the community.
