Dear, Principal

If you make it required that students have a B average then many extra curricular activity's will drop drastically in population, some will even die off. You should not do this it will start a rebellion in the classrooms and our school will get worse and worse. If you think that this will pressure kids into doing more work and trying harder your wrong. Us kids are a bunch of lazy people today and if you do this things aren't going to change, they might even get worse. it is outrageous that you would think of doing this. Kids won't change their grades because of this. Anyway we will all be in high school next year anyway and it is your school so you can do what you want with it. This is just a warning, if you do this kids everywhere will resent you and this school will become on of the worst.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
