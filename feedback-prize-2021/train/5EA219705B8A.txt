I personally am all for the driverless cars idea. Through time, everything has evolved and is still eveolving to newer and better ideas of the original. For example, we started with little shacks, now we have skyscrapers, we rode horses now we have cars, we had mail, now we have email or texting, the point I am trying to make is everything needs to evolve for us to improve anything. Technology is a big part of our lives today and we rely on it for most of anything and everything.

Every year we have thousands maybe millions of deaths and injuries resulting from car crashes, the fact of the matter is, people are irresponsible and reckless. We have drunk driving, texting and driving, and simply just not paying attention that causes all these wrecks and I believe that driverless cars could solve all these problems and save a lot of lives.

Driverless cars could also solve other problems such as gas prices. In the story it mentions that driverless cars use half the amount of gas as taxis do and they are way more efficient. People could have a lot more money spending half the amount of money they usually do on gas. Do you know how much money people spend on gas? A lot. So these are the reasons that I am all for driverless cars, it's the next big thing, why would we say no to that?
