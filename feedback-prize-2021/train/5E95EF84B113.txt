Dear TEACHER_NAME

I am writing this letter to inform you on my opinion on whether or not you should require students to perform some act of community service.

In my point of view I think you should only let the kids that want to do community service do it. If you require your students to perform community service and they do not want to they will not do a good job. The kids that want to do community service do it because they like it and they can put it on their future resume.

Other kids think that when you are doing community service you are giving back to the community. The are but there are other ways to do so as well. They could join a form of sports team for the town and try their best to win for their community. They could do their best in school to represent the community in a good way. They may also have a job, pay their taxes and their bills.

So, if you want to make kids do community service go right ahead. The only thing I am telling you is you are not going to get the best results out of it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
