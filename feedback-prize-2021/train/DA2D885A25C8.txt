Dear Principle:

I believe that not allowing cell phones in school is the better decision. I think this because some kids already text during class. By having their phones at home they will stay focused on what they are supposed to be doing. All it takes is one little thing like letting us text or call during free time is going to tell us kids we can text whenever we feel like it. If you take away cell phones we will not be nearly as distracted.

Let's say we did let us text whenever we had free time I would start texting almost every hour I had free time on my hands. Other students who would have homework wouldn't do it because they can use their cell phone. Me I only use my cell phone when I can. It is your decision to make but ask some of the teachers they will say the same. I am all for policy 2 just because I have never used my cell phone in class. I'm just warning you things can and will get out of hand sooner than you will expect it.

I think that the sooner we get rid of cell phones in school the better because if you don't and you go with policy 1 it will all go down hill. Besides you never hear about anyone else allowing texting during free time so why start now. Though you might think allowing us to text in school is a great idea it isn't. So think policy 2 not policy one.

Sincerely,
