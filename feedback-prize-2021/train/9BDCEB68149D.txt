There have been many claims about the Face being a sign of intelligent life forms on Mars. The Face is not an extraterestrial artifact. It is just a natural landform. By looking at the images from 1976 and 1998 I can see where someone might mistake it for a humaniod face. The images are a little blurry and because of this you can see what appears to be eyes, a nose and a mouth.

Upon closer inspection of the 2001 image you can see it is just a natural landform such as a mountain that formed from the wind blowing sand over the years. NASA has done scientific research to prove to you that the Face isn't really a face, it's just a mountain that resembles one.

There have been many claims of extraterestrial life forms on Mars. Most of these claims lack evidence. There may still be life on Mars, but we have yet to gather any real evidence. I assure you that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform that shadows had an effect on to make it appear to resemble a monument. If it wasn't for the high resolution camera that was used to take the 2001 image of the Face, we might still believe it to be an extraterestrial monument.
