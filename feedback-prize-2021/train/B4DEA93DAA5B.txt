Today's modern technology is advancing at a faster rate each year and we use it in our everyday lives and helped us in so many ways. Why shouldn't they help us with education?

Technology should be more widely accepted and used in academic settings, as they have many benefits. They have the ability to make learning more engaging, lessons to be more accessible, and overall convenient in certain situations for some people.

Distance learning is an amazing concept and should be offered more in schools, and there are several reasons why it should. Many students with long term illnesses or injuries are not able to attend school because of their current situation. It can result in a negative effect on their academic abilities and may take a toll on their graduation requirements, thus, may prevent them from doing so.

There are also students who have trouble getting to school or are not able to attend school traditionally. Online schooling would be very convenientÂ in their case. They wouldn't have to worry about getting to classes on time and can learn at their own pace.

Distance learning is amazing, but most great ideas can have negative components. Even though technology is advancing, that doesn't mean it's completely flawless. There can be technological issues, for example, the device not being able to connect to the internet properly. There can also be distractions in home settings. Family members, especially young children, can disrupt your attention. And tempting activities like video games and television can do so too. But these problems can easily be fixed compared to the ones that prevents certain students from attending. The positives easily outshines the negatives in this case.
