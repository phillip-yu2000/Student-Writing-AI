I think driverless cars are a great invention. Driverless cars would make everyone's lives easier. It would save lots of time, and even keep people safer. I think everyone should have access to self driving cars. This technology could help us improve our lives, and open a new world of technology for us.

I strongly agree with Google cofounder, Sergy Brin, on his ideas about public transportation. Public transportation systems that self drive would be amazing. It would indeed change the world. These cars would make transportation extremely easy, and replace old cars.

These cars could also make driving even more safer for people. The self driving cars have sensors that can auto brake. This could prevent many accidents in the future, and maybe save lives. Although this technology may help, it all lies on the driver. This technology may cause carless drivers. All in all, the technology of driverless cars could make driving safer than it is today.

Overall, I think that driverless cars are a good idea. They are safer for people, and young drivers. Also, they are just convienient for us. It would improve out quality of life. I would like to see these care implemented into our daily lives.
