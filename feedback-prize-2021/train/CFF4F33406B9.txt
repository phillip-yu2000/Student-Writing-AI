To TEACHER_NAME, I hear your considering changing the school policy where we can not participate in sports or activities unless we hold a B average. Which is understandable, but I disagree completely. Sports and activities are a way for us students to escape from what's around us, perhaps a rough lifestyle. Maybe that's the only thing keeping a student going is their passion for football, basketball, art club, or chess club. Their hopes and dreams are what might be helping them out in life. And if they can't hold a B average to keep from losing their dreams. They'd have themselves and part you to blame for that.

I don't think you should change the schools policy because I know it's possible for students as well as I to hold a B average but to think of the students who have to struggle to keep it need our help getting their. Many of us have the ability to get A' s or A' s and B' s but we just have to put forth effort to doing it. Some students might only come to school for the sports and outside activities and we shouldn't take that away from them. Some students sports and activities might be their only way of having a future. They might not have money to go to college on. And we shouldn't be responsible for a child not being able to survive in the world.

In addition I am going to argue that it would help build character in a student and responsibility. It would force them to do something that they really wanted and teach them to reach their goals, and to know and realize anything's possibly if your willing to work for it. Were all smart in our own special and unique way. God put us on this Earth to do something right.
