Dear Principal,

I think that your idea is an excellent idea.

There are to many people who play sports or other things and than after they get hurt or can't play are left with nothing. So many people, athletes especially, don't even make it to college because they have spent so much time in practice or in games. If you can't maintain at least a B average then where do they expect to go when they are done playing.

My personal experience is a great one. I have two older brothers. One is 31 and the other 27. My older brother just finished his masters degree in marketing and is now working on his own company not only trying to take that far past his expectations, but is also going around the U.S. doing speech and debate contest. The other one is a high school graduate who is now working at the OTHER_NAME hotel as the head bar manager. Both great jobs, but different life styles. There is one major difference between the two though. One has gone of to college and the other stopped at high school. RELATIVE_NAME my 27 year old brother has had a great life so far, but always having his burden of not going to college. The reason is, is that he didn't have a good enough GPA. He played sports his whole life and was the star. He had one to many injuries though to keep on going. By the time he realized that he wouldn't be getting a scholarship because he was done getting hurt and didn't want to play was when he also realized that he couldn't get into college because of his grades.

This is why you shouldn't be allowed to play sports unless you have a B average. If this was the case when my brother played football he might have a completely different life. With a B average even if sports or some other activity doesn't take you where you want to go you know that you will have your back up plan with your grades.

Sincerely,
