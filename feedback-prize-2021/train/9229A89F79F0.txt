Self driving cars are a step into the future that is vital. For so long we have had to put up with the hassle of driving from place to place that it sometimes gets old. Self driving cars are more than just for acomidation or a fine example of how well off you are, they help with many things such as scientific understanding of computerization, fuel consumption and waste, as well as those who are visually impared or have any other kind of dissability that prevent them from driving. We as a nation must work together to bring notice to the regulaters who will not allow testing of Self atonomous driving cars because without the testing we will not be able to help that pregnant neighbor get to the hispital to deliver her baby in time, or help our grand parents get to a crucial doctors appointment, or simiply enjoy the clean and emmition free enviroment with our very own family. These and many other things are possible if we bring attention to regulaters and let car manufacturers work together to come up with the perfect car. I'm not saying it will be easy or quick because that is simpily not true, but together and with our needs we can make it happen. We really do need self drving cars it is only a process of advancement that should not be taken out of the equation of scientific evolution.
