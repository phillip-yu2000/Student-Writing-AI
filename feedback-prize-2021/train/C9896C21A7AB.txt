So you are wondering what multiple opinions may help you with? well here you go.

Multiple opinions show you other people's thoughts and what they see, artists like hearing other peoples opinions due to one main thing, it will let them hear what the other person sees when they paint, so I think that multiple opinions is a good thing for anyone who is doing research on a subject, or is an artist that paints, or even a writer.

Henceforth my reasoning is that, if you care what other people think, or see, or even read! Gather other people's opinions, it would help out a lotÂ for you, it would also show what that you care about what people think of you, even if you dont really care, just think about it, use other people's opinions on a subject, or on a painting, or on a book. It may help you enough to be worth the work of gaining their trust so they tell you their true opinion, not a lie.

Multiple opinions can help you

Multiple opinions may find issues in the way you write, or paint.

Multiple opinions Is Key in research,cause if you use one, its biased already, so utilize more than one opinion to make sure the information is not Biased.
