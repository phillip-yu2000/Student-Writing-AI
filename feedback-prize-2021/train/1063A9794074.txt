Imagien, you're going on a little vacation trip with your faimly or friends. But there's a program called the UNRRA

that you wanted to do. So you put it aside for next year becuase you wanted to hang out with your friends or faimly. Some people wanted to do things like programs or groups but couldn't becuase they have "other things" to do that aren't that really important. So this paper should make you think twice about going or signing up for the UNRRA program.

My first reason to join the UNRRA program is becuase you get to help other people in other countries that are in need for help or care. The UNRRA helpes people from Europe to China and give them stuff like food, water, and other things becuase of the war that happened in Europe which we call World War 2.

My second reason why you should join the UNRRA program is becuase that you get to see other countries or cities that aren't pausible to travel on foot, car, or train. You can get to see other counties like China, Greece, Crete, and even Panama Canal for a matter of fact.

My last reason to why you should join the UNRRA program is that there's fun activeities on the UNRRA ship to do. There's vollyball, boxing, table-tennis tornaments, fencing, baseball, whistleing, reading, and other sports or relaxing things to do before we go back to get more supplies for the people in Europe and people in other countries.

I hope this paper made you think twice about signing up or joining the UNSSA program. I'll also hope you'll join the UNRRA program sooner or later to help out others in Europe and people from other countries to make them feel safe, cared for, and happy.
