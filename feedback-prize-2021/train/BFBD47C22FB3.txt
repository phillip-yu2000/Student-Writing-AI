I think making students have a b average to do sports or other activities is a bad idea. not every student can get or maintain a b average. getting c is a average grade, not a bad grade its an average grade.

It shouldn't be looked at as a bad grade.

It would be a different story if you wanted to change i from a d average to a c average. I think it would be okay then. But not a c to a b.

Also more people get a c average than a b average so there wouldn't be as many people going out for the sports teams for other activities. Because they wouldn't be aloud to or they didn't want to put the hard work out to get a b. In my opinion its kind of discriminating against people with lower grades. Maybe sports is the only thing they can do. Or if they had problems in math, science, English or social studies and could only get a c, they wouldn't be able to play the sport they love or go out for an activity they love. If i were the principal i would just leave it the way it was. Some times change is a good thing but in this cause not so much.
