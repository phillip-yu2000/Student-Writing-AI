From Luke's point of view participating in a Seagoing Cowboys program would be lots of fun because it said in the article it said it was a once in a lifetime expirence. Also you would have to be careful because if you have a night job and it is raining you would have to make sure you dont break anything when you go up the stairs. Also in the boat you would travel to alot of countries. There are many things you could volunteer for the Seagoing Cowboys program. It might be fun i mean you would help animals. Also you would have to be paitent because it takes awhile to get place to place. It said in the article it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. You also help people with thier needs. It will maybe open your eyes alittle so you can see that you should be grateful for what you have. On board you can play baseball,volleyball,and table tennis and many more things so you won't be bored out of your misery.

So as you can see it will be a fun expierience unless you get hurt or something but other than that it surely will. Luke's claim was probalay to particapate and enjoy it. Also Luke should thank Don Reist because Don is the one who mentioned this opportunity. Also this program was for the helpfulness of World War 2 so the people could get thier food supplies and all that stuff.
