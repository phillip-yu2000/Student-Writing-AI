Driverless cars are a huge step in technology and may workout to be very useful, but there is always that percent chance that it will fail. For example if I were to own one of these Driverless cars I would

Be worried about one thing, and that is running into other cars. I wouldnt want to own one of these because I personally do not trust them.

A huge problem for me would be liability. For example, If I am in one of these driverless cars and a surrounding car near me runs a red light and I go head on with them because this driverless car could not react in time because it doesn't have the senses of a human. If my life was not taken would it be my fault that I got into a wreck or would it be the manufacture's fault? Just like the article said new traffic laws will certaintly be needed in order to make this possible. There is a reason why only 3 out of our 50 states are currently allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars and that is because people do not trust these things. If these companies are releasing these cars in 2020 then they better change the law to make it safe for the driver and the companies by four years. I also do not think that they can make these cars as aware as some human drivers are. For example if the car gets hit it has nothing to lose, but the human inside the car is trying to protect their life.

I personally believe that they should prohibit these cars from coming out in the United States. They could possibly release them in another country and then bring them to the U.S. if they workout in other countries. The reason for that is because our liability laws are not where they need to be yet in my opinion.
