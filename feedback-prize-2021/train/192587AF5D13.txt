This idea i think is very usefull for teachers now, its bad enough we cant understand a persons mood. It is bad because someone could be sad or angry but the person wont say anything to get it out of his or her system. If we had this system it would be great to know wether a student is okay, fine or depressed. The fact that we already know six characterisitc movements means that we can probably find more. The six basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.

The bad things about the emotion detecting system is that it could mess up some how and it would tell the teacher that this kid is sad but he is happy. The machine could be really expensive and schools wouldnt even be interested in buying these systems. The system could probably pick up other emotions that are not propriate and the kid would feel embarrased. Why would a teacher really want this system anyways.

Overall i think this machine is beneficial to schools everywhere in the United States. The system sounds like it will be because of how much knowlege u know from a student because of there emotional look. This can be great for the student also, to let him know that that the section he just read was boring or fun. I think this emotion system will be great for every school in the future.
