Have you ever wondered what it's like to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? If your not in it, you should do it! There are so many reasons to join the program. Don and I sighed up, and you should too.

I got to help animals while everyone else dosent have the time for it. Seagoing Cowboys took care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. f you have any exsperence what careing for animals, you'll be great at this! I used to work at my aunt Katie's farm as a boy, so that prepared me for this.

I got to see beautiful sights when I was a Seagoing Cowboy. You travel ALOT when you do what I did. If you ever wanted to travel the world and see sights that not many people get to to see, then you ought to join.

Even though there is a lot of work to do, and worrying about the dangers of being a seagoing Cowboy, you get to have fun with the other cowboys. They play baseball and volleyball games in empty holds where animals had been housed. And to pass the time, we play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and played games.

To sum up my thoughts, if you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you get to help alot of people, animals, and countries to recover from World War II, and you get to do what you love to do and have fun doing it. So thoughs were my reasons why you should be a Seagoing Cowboy.
