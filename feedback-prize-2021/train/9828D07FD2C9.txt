Dear Principal:

I believe that it is unfair to make a rule that says a student has to have a C average in order to participate sports.

The reason I think it is unfair is because having a C average is okay, for it is hard to balance sports and school and punishing someone that works hand in and out of school desires some leniency.

What about those students that work real hard in school and they find time to study, they get help from a tutor, and do all there homework but still have a C average.

Also, what about those kids that do well in school but get so scared then they fail the test and have a C average because they don't do well on test.

I just think that athletes need some lenience when it comes to grades.

I would think the whole student body would back me up went I say that the rule is unfair.
