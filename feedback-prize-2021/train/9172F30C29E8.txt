I think that the principal of your school should have to make everyone perform community service. I know that they may have stuff to do with friends, but school activities come before social life. Community service is helpful for our city. It can help in many ways, for example putting an ad in the newspaper for cleaning houses.

The principal is the boss of the school and could make up his own rules when he or she feels is needed. Even if the principal cannot make the students do community service, she can at least do a school speech about how our city needs to be clean.

Maybe the principal could bribe the students with a prize for the school if they all do community service. For instance, they could all go to a amusement park at the end of the year. The point is, wouldn't you want to have a clean environment and want to be able to breath in fresh air. Community service is not a punishment, it is a healthy way make our society clean.

After you have served the community service you will have enough time to do what have had planned. I would understand if you played sports for the school and had a team practice, but other than that you should be there. The principal should put a law that if you don't attend community service you don't go to this school.
