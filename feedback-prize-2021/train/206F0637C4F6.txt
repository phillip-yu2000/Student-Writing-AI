Dear Florida state senator,

I believe that we should keep this Electoral college process because it will be very helpful. With the Electoral college process it is not just popular vote that wins. If it was just popular vote that won then we would not even have smart people running for president and have celebrities winning and becoming president. With the Electoral college process there is also the presidency vote. The presidency vote basically tells us wether they are smart or not. "Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election then the kind we have now." In this piece of evidence it shows how the presidency vote inside the Electoral college process can win an election even if you win the popular vote. Which shows how much more important the Presidency vote is and why we need the Electoral college process. If we lost it we would be lost. Just imagine people like Kim Kardashian being a president.

Sincerely, Someone who cares
