Driverless cars might be the future but is it safe. Their are still arguments o weather this is safe or not but their are already driverless cars today. Driverless cars have been tested and driven for many miles without accidents but they are not fully driverless. Their might be smart cars but they still have their compications such as pulling out of the drivway and driving through constuction work on the roads. For these reasons and more I am against driverless cars.

Although they are supposed to be driverless the help of driver are still needed. What if the car cannot handle the situation and the driver needs to take control and the car malfunctions. This can result in an accident that wasnt neccecaraly the drivers fault. Would the blame be the drivers who couldnt do anything but struggle to take controle of a malfuntioning driverless car. If its not certain wether the driver or the company gets the blame for the acident then these should not be out on the streets.

I think they are dangerouse and not as reliable as a regular manuale driven car. If the law cant back you up for these types of things yet then I dissagree with the use of driverless cars. Peoples lives are in danger with cars that are not yet fully operational to take on the road. If driverless cars cant guarante no malfunctions do to probable causes then I stay against these driverless cars of the future.
