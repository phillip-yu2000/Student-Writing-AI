Driverless cars have always been a point of interest as our technology advances. I am for driverless cars because they could make the roads safer.

These driverless cars are not completely driven by a computer. There are certain times where the person in the car has to take over, like work zones or accidents. However, for the most part, these cars have so many sensors and cameras in them that they can drive without the help of a human driver. This could mean that accidents that happen when the driver is distracted or incapacitated, would never happen. Once our technology advances ever furthur and these cars actualy become driverless, then they could prevent accidents.

Cars made by companies like Google or Tesla are not only interested in make a cars driverless, but they want to make a car that would be better for the environment. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a car that "would use half of the fuel", and Tesla's focus has been on electric cars. Both of these options reduce or elimate the need for fossil fuels, therefore reducing carbon emmissions and taking better care of our environment.

Although there is some serious work to be done to be able to test these cars to improve the cars to be legally considered safe, I think that the reality of driverless cars is not to far away, and that it is a good thing. They could make the road a safer place and help out our environment.
