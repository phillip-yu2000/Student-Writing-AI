When people ask for advice from me I don't know what to say. Most people want advice for crushes, items, decisions,and inspiration. I know that some of my friends need advice for something like guitars or some thing like that. Everyone asks for advice or something like this for example; hey what should we do for our spring break go to the movies or go to water park. This is a good example cause some of us don't know what to do for spring break. We gain confidence from friends and their experience

I know for a fact teenagers always ask for advice about crushes. I know sometimes I cant talk to my crush and same with my other friends as well. and sometimes they arent getting noticed and sometimes they ask for help when asking someone out. they ask their friends their family and when they do that they gain more confidence and confidence leads to talking and feeling free. We gain confidence from friends and their experience as I said before

We make decisions all the time from food to hobbies to friends. We have a bond with friends and family that we trust each other and make sure we never break that. We all go ahead and go make decisions and some of them are bad but it keeps happening and you realize that its a good decision and because of that our hobbies are made by a bond of talking and practice and much more

We all make decisions and some of them are hard and some of them are easy. We have to get threw with our lives with our advice and much more. Some of us are antisocial and we go see a psychiatrist .therefore we gain confidence from friends and their experience
