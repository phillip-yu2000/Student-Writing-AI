i as a standby and a typist (whatever that means). i am not fully agree to this extracurricular activity thing that is going around this school, because when i was a mere child. we had this sorta thing to but more easier,but since school nowadays is getting harder then it used to be back in 1950's. this perhaps may be excellent, but like i said before in the begin of my talk. i dont fully agree even though this will help the students. but the extracurricular activity here are well for kids who, are interested in sports, or kids who are interested in taking photos? (which sounds very boring for students at this particular age, well for some of them) or for students who want to make their speech sound like a good speech(a boring one) and sound more exsiqsitictÂ (i dont know how to pronounce it) or whatever the kids like they should maybe join or perhaps join one activity. thats all i have to say from myself. thank you for your perticepice
