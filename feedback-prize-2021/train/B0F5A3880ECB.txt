Principal,

Sports and activities for a student is a good thing for them it relieves stress and helps them out with coping with things in life because it gives them something to do.

Yes, students do need to make good grades but sports, I believe, is not the reason most students are failing.

I know that playing sports is a privilege that not everybody deserves but moving the grades you have to make to a higher average to play sports that is just not right.

Some students need help and have trouble learning and may want to play sports and if they are trying to get that C so that they can pass and they tried their hardest then I believe that they deserve it because they have tried so hard.

Putting up the grade average is just going to cause less people in sports because some struggle to make an A average or even a B average because school is not as easy as everyone puts it out to be.

Yes you all are trying to make us smarter and make it to were going thru life is easier because we know most things is great but we are just humans everyone nearly is going to make a C or even fail something once in their life if not more and taking away a privilege for a passing C, I think is not right to do at all.

Your Student,
