Lots of people have been saying that there is a "face" on Mars. People think that it was created by aliens. NASA scientists are most likely hiding some key information about this natural landform to keep conspiracies.

I believe that the "face" on Mars was created naturally by winds or other natural occurung events on Mars. There has been more and more information on the "face". Were getting pictures that are more sharp and clearer.

If there was any other objects such as; small shacks and buildings the images have gotten so much clearer that the camera would have easily captured them. In 1976 you can make out a face, But in 1998 you can't really tell that there is a face anymore. I think it is a natural landform because you can clearly tell that it has been blown away. In 2001 you can clearly tell that the whole right side of the "face" has been blown away because it was natural.
