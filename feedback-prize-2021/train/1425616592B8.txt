In the story Cowboy who Road the Waves i have to support why people would want to do his job. There are many reasons. Who would like a job that you got to see the world and travel. I would like to see the world. whaty about you?

In 1947 the world wars finaly ended WW1 and WW2 had a spand of 30 years. There was alot of mess to clean up and you had to be a certain person to do it. The see cowboys where just the right people. Luke said in the story that it was a fun job. But also hard. You got to see the world and do many activitys. You had lots of free time. But it was very dangerous he even broke his ribs doing it.

Luke stated that he got to see many countrys. He had free time to do what he wanted. All whole he did alot of good. But he wasnt at home very often and that ment he had no permanit home. He just traveled.

I think this wound be a great job for someone who wants to travel. Not have a family. Or wants to have a abnormal life. I dont know if i would want to do this job or not. All in all i think it would be a great job.
