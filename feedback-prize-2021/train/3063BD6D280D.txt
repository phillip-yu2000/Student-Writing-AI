How would you feel if you had a school that made you work nonstop for the whole day, it would be tiring. Thats why I think students shouldnt have to take classes without a class that They chose, therefor students should take these classes, because doing other activities can relax their brains after lots of studying. For example a student could be really worn out from a test, but his still exited for that class he chose .Thats why students should get extracurricular classes so they can enjoy school.

If a student for example want to do sports and he really liked it and wants to join a team and becomes a professional it would have never ever happened if the school never gave him the chance. Theres many other things that students miss because his or her school never gave him or her a chance,therefor a school should try its best to present its students with many different options, for example ,coding,engineering,music,acting. and many more.

All these things could be activities student have talents for.

So making a student choose a class could influence them to do lots of things and it can make their school day better.
