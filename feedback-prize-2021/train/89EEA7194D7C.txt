Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I believe that as long as a student has a C average they should be able to participate in all school activity's. Yes its true that when a student has a b average he/she will be more successful in life. If that student strives to his/her best they should be rewarded. I understand that failure is not acceptable, but in some cases that's not the students fault.

The student may not be comfortable in the class room. They may not understand yet, is scared to ask a question which may be able to help them in the long run. If a student is scared to ask a question there is clearly something wrong. If this is fixed their grade may be improve.

If you take away sports, clubs and, other activities away from them their not going to want to strive to get that B or C. All though C is not as good as an A it is not an failure. Tutoring is provided to help kids but, most teachers only offer it before and after school. If a student has no transportation then the tutoring does not help him/her. I strongly believe that if you allow kids to be their selves and, provide the help they need on the students terms instead of the adults, the grades will go up. The fearfulness and failure will go down.
