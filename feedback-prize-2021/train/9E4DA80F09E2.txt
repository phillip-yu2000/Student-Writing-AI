I finally got everyones attention in the plaza, Now just to let them know.''Everyone can I have your attention! If anybody is looking for a decent job then please listen. I used to work for two jobs at the same time, but one day a friend came to me and said if I wanted to become a Seagoing Cowboy, Well you all might be thinking...well what in tarnation is a Seagoing Cowboy! Well let me explain, A Seagoing Cowboy is a person hired by the UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Adminastration). More than 40 Nations joined this.

What you will be doing is taking care of horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas, we are doing this due to World War II. Some Countries were left in ruins and are low on the Stock Market. People, please join!!! You guys should join to HELP others. If you think traveling on a boat is boring, YOU ARE WRONG!!!! We play games on the ship. Trust me these games make the trip even faster! All we need to do is watch the cows and feed them. Pretty easy, People!

I hope you ALL want to join thihs program becuase just imagine if OUR Country was in Ruins, You all know that others will help us. So join now!!! I'm just going to say this now, THIS IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY!!! So if interested please let one of the cowboys know and once you let us know, you will become one too''!
