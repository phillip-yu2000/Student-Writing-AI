Although extracurricular activities are great they should not be mandatory. Sports and clubs can be wonderful, but there is always a downside. Some children just don't have time. That is why I disagree with the principal because not all kids can do extracurricular activities.

Children just don't have time for extra things in their lives. Some children don't get home until very late at night because their parents work late. It's not their faults, but making extracurricular's mandatory is putting more stress on parents too. When some students get home they have hours of homework to do. Homework can make you stay up extremely late and that can make you tired for school the next day.

A lot of students have extra work around the house that they have to do when they get home. Some students have to do chores that take hours. Students have to cook dinner,clean, and babysit. Doing chores,homework,and a extracurricular activity would be too much stress for a child. If the children had to do all of that they would never end up going to bed!

There are some students who don't work well in groups. Forcing that on them would just make them feel worse. Some children have horrible anxiety and working in groups can make them afraid. I know from experience that when children that suffer from anxiety have to do something they feel they can't they will have a panic attack. That is something that is very hard to deal with and when they go into that state you can't get them out, you just have to comfort them. That is why I personally think you shouldn't force kids into activities.

Students need to be reassured that they have a choice because being forced into something is never enjoyable especially since we're teenagers. We don't like to listen and usually do the opposite of what we get told to do. Giving us the decision of if we want to do extracurricular activities or not will give us responsibility. That is why I compelety disagree with the principal. We want a choice!
