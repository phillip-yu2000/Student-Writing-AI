Do you want to go on daily trips and help people in war strucken countries?

Well you might want to become a "Cowboy" who "Rides the Waves."

My name is Luke and I'm here to tell you why you should become a "Wave-rider"

I think you should become a cowboy who rides the waves because you get to help different people in different countries.

You get to have a little experience going on your record.

When you become a cowboy you feel a sense of civic participation and recognition for what you are doing.

Here at UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) we dedicate our lives to helping people.

Here's the benifit of why you should join, you get to go on daily trips to distant countries and meet new people. Evidence from the text that supports my claim is, " 'Besides helping people, I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China.

But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,' he says.

'So was taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.'

Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to china."

You can also do fun things on the ship that you are on while you are sailing.

Some things that you can do on the ship are, baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the games also helped pass time.

Information from the text that supports my answer is, "Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.

The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed.

Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time."

In conclusion you should become a "wave-riding" cowboy because you feel a sense on appreciation and you are doing huge favors for other countries.
