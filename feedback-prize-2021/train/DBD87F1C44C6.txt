Today the majority of people use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of us just can't put them down, not even when it can cause other people to be unsafe. We use them from when we wake up to when we finally go to sleep. But is there a time that we shouldn't be on our cell phones? When we're driving it is never a good idea to be on your phone.

The reason that its a bad idea to be on your phone during driving is that it takes away your attention from the road. Driving is already a multitasking operation. We have to balance our speed, gas level, directions, music, air conditioning, and other drivers. The last thing we need is another thing to focus on, especially an entertainment device that we already struggle to put down. All cell phones do for drivers is add another thing to focus on, and the list of things for drivers to focus on is already too long.

Another reason not to allow phones in the hands of drivers is that, although distraction is a large issue, even if you argue that you can pay attention and multitask well enough, your reaction time is still slowed. It has been proven that multitasking lowers a person's ability to act efficiently. This also applies to driving. Not only do you run the risk of missing a turn or passing that restaurant that you were looking for, you run a very large risk of not reacting soon enough to a distracted driver, running off of the road, and rear ending a stopping car. Your slowed reaction time is a very large issue when using cell phones while driving.

The reasons for not using cell phones while driving are very compelling and should not be taken lightly. Many people lose their lives every year due to distracted driving. It is important to stay very focused and aware while driving. Do not risk your safety or someone else's due to cell phone usage while driving.
