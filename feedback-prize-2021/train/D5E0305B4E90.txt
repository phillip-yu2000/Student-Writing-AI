Is it good to give someone multiple opinions about something. Yes I think that if you give someone many opinions on what to do it will help them pick the right one. It gives them many ideas on what to do. It also helps them realize everything that is going on with that reason.

The first thing that helps is, you give them many ideas on what to do. It can help open up the subject for people and they really realize whats going on. It also gives them ideas on what to do. If i asked my friend for advice, I would what him to give me multiple opinions about the question i asked him because the more information he gives me the more I will known.

Another good reason is it helps open your mind to the subject. If you are trying to make a decision and you do not know much about the topic then you should ask for advice. It always good to ask for help. Asking multiple people would benefit the most. Multiple opinions is always better then one.

There are some good reasons to ask for help. Remember asking for advice or help is always good no matter what. I always ask for advice when i needit and you should to. Remeber many opinions is was better then one.
