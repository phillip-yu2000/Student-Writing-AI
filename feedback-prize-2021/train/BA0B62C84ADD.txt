In today's day in age drivers range from the age of 15 to 70 and older so there is indeed a large range of di? erent drivers with di? erent experiences and di? erent skills behind the wheel. Many people take pride in their ability to mulBtask while driving like being able to seamlessly merge into ongoing tra? c with one hand while trying to calm down their crying child in the back. But a common boast upon many people is their ability to use their phone while driving and not being fazed or seeing it as a distracBon since they think it is not that much of a danger to them or anyone around them. This is a very bad trait as distracted driving is the number one cause of car related accidents in America with reckless driving coming in second which can also happen when drivers use their phone as it can lead to them losing focus and driving recklessly. Reasons like this is why most cars don't have dvd players in the front seat for the passengers side as it can be a distracBon to the driver. Driving while being on a phone is also illegal in some states like

Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, and Illinois with a ?ne of $50,00 and up to 1 year in prison. The main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

The ?rst reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash. It's been documented that 19% of drivers of all ages admit to sur? ng the web while driving. In a blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it states,"This one is preWy obvious, but did you know that you are 23 Bmes more likely to crash if you text and drive? According to the NaBonal Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes due to texBng while driving happen each year. If you don't want to crash your car and get injured or even killed, don't text and drive." These staBsBcs show just how dangerous texBng and driving is and why people shouldn't overlook this issue as it is a naBonal problem that doesn't get published enough. Most people like to ignore the problem of texBng while driving as they might have grown up with older ?gures who do the same. A good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an arBcle that states,"Cell phone use while driving staBsBcs and texBng and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. In 2017 according to the NaBonal Highway Tra? c Safety AdministraBon, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distracBon-a? ected crashes, accounBng for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. Knowing cell phone use while driving staBsBcs and texBng and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk. TexBng while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and staBsBcs show that this mulBtasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texBng while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains o? the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers." This arBcle shows that teens especially need to be more mindful when it comes to what they do in their vehicle since they are so young and easily persuaded that might think it's okay to use their phone if their friend is calling or if they want to record something while driving even though it's never safe. It also shows how since most teens just start o? driving they are inexperienced and don't know how to mulBtask. A car crash is one of the most traumaBzing things to happen to a person with many surviving vitamins gaining

PTSD from the experience. With that being said using your phone while mulBtasking in the car could result in a car crash.

The second reason why drivers should not be able to use their cell phone while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk. Many people use their phones while driving when they're with their friends or family as they might feel comfortable enough to do so or feel they are skilled enough to do so..In another blog post by Napoli Shkolnik PLLC it says,"Not only does texBng and driving put your own life at risk, but it also gravely endangers the lives of other people around you. As a driver, you are responsible not only for the passengers in your car, but also for other motorists on the road, not to menBon pedestrians who oben end up hurt or killed because of the negligence of drivers. Speaking of pedestrians, you know how kids can pop up seemingly out of nowhere and get on the road? Well, you are much less likely to noBce them while looking at the phone in your lap." This piece of commentary on the issue greatly embodies how other people's wrongdoing might a? ect anybody caught in the crosshairs like a child crossing the street. It also provides commentary on how much you value the people in your car if you're willing to put them in such grave danger in that case. Another good point can be found from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where they have an arBcle that says,"Because technology will change and new distracBons will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is conBnuously aWenBve and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracBng devices while driving.

According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the bene? ts of pugng away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks." This arBcle makes great use of the theme of technology with how it can a? ect someone's mindset. It also shows how parents need to educate their kids to be beWer drivers. Pugng their friends at risk and potenBally harming them is something that nobody wants to do. Which is another reason why people must stop using their phones while driving.

In conclusion the main reasons why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operaBng a vehicle is because you are more likely to crash and you put others at risk.

Drivers should stop trying to mulBtask everything and do everything at once and just pay aWenBon to the road. The road is shared by everybody so when one sel? sh person decides to not pay aWenBon and drive around clueless then everyone else su? ers. Although it would be considerably easier to pull over and use your phone while parked many people go out of their way to sBll put many lives in danger because of the inconvenience. Consequences gegng caught driving while being on your phone also include spikes in insurance rates as companies will charge you higher premiums. Bragging about being reckless on the road should be condemned and not boasted all mulBtasking while driving by using your phone only shows impaBence and immaturity. TexBng and driving has caused six Bmes more deaths than drunk driving yet people sBll shrug it o? due to them thinking they can manage to keep their aWenBon in two places at once. Hopefully beginner drivers are taught to take their Bme on the road and not to be in a rush to respond to a noB?caBon immediately and wait and do it when the Bme is right.
