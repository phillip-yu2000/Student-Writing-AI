Dear principle:

Image you are in a classroom and an emergency occurs, and there is no one else to help you, what do you do? This is why cell phones are important to have at school. I am writing this letter to explain the importance of cell phones at school. I hope you take time out of your busy day to read my letter and take it into consideration.

First off, cell phones are not cheap. students also treat them like it is there child. would go nowhere without them. This information, I feel can teach good parenting skill for later on in life. students should keep them off in school, but they should be able to care them around like little children they will be able to have once they reach adulthood

Secondly, cell phones are a great way to communicate. This is a great way for students to communicate with other students all over the school. This would help students with studying and would make sure that no student is left out by his or her self. cell phones can be a great boost to self-esteem all over the school. This would reduce the amount of bullying and would give kids a real chance to make good life friends.

Lastly, if a emergency where to happen to a student at school. Other kids would be able to call for held if needed and would even save a kids life.

If a student would have a cell phone without emergency contact number, then they should not even be aloud to have a cell phone in the first place. So say one of your kids had an accident at school wound' t you want the to contact you.

I thank you for taking time out of your bust schedule to come and read my letter. I hope this will change your way of thinking about cell phones in school, and i hope you go with the first policy of cell phones.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
