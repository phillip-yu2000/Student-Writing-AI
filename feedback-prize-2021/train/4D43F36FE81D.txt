Hello Mr. Senator I have came to the conclusion our country needs to abolish the electoral college and change to the election by popular vote. Here's a couple reasons why we should go with the popular vote.

The first reason we should go with the popular vote is because the citizens of the U.S. will get to vote for who they want. Honestly in my opinion if you use the electoral college it will be rigged. If you go with the popular vote anyone and everyone can vote. It seems pretty fair to me.

In the source by Bradford Plumer he says "At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters." How is it unfair? Its unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. So thats a whole couple of states who wont give votes to one certain person.

The final reason we need to go with the popular vote is the disaster factor. In the source by Bradford Plumer he says "Back in 1960, segregationist in the Lousiana legistature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electores who would oppose John F. Kennedy." It wouldnt be fair to the candidate.

As you can see the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The popular vote is only fair to the candidates. The candidates can compaign and try to convince people to vote for them. Its not a cheating senerio like the electoral collage so please sir go with the poular vote.
