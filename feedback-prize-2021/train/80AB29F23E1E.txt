Dear Principle,

I believe that not all students are required to pick up litter around the community, only the ones that have the opinion to help. I think this because doing things for the community is a choice for people to make on there own. For example, some people could be busy with family, friends or other relatives. Also, i think picking up litter near road is a dangerous thing because of traffic. Trash and other litter could be located in a troubling spot, mostly because some strangers can't be trusted. Most of the danger near roads are not predictable and students being injured. Weather is another thing that could affect students in our school by disease. This could take off of homework time or rushing it, making grades drop. Some litter is bio-degradable which means it will not affect our environment in a negative way. I am asking if you don't make the students in our school pick up litter if it is not there responsibility. Town's people should know not to litter.

From,
