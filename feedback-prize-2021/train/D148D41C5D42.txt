Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should allow cell phones on school campus for a multiple of reasons. Number one the use of cell phones should be allowed, because if you didn't know how you were getting home that day you could call your guardians and see how you would be getting home. Cell phones could come in handy to if you needed to use a calculator of some sort. Number two, if you had a relative of some sort that had been sick or was in a hospital you could check up on them and see how there progress was moving along.

Well, I agree with you that cell phones should be prohibited at certain times especially in class because they can become a distraction to not just that person, but people around them. It could cause some chaos between the teacher and the student as well.

When students have lunch break it should be allowed for the use of one. Students could maybe call other students on lunch break as well and go have lunch at a nearby healthy restaurant so they can keep that good health up and not cause any type of virus or bacteria to go around. Plus going to go eat somewhere else could get them some fresh air to get the brain flowing again.

Well, as you know all students would enjoy having policy one including myself. That is my opinion and most of the others, but you do what you think would be the biggest benefit for our school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
