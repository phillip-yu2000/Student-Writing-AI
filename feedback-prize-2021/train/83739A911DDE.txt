The use of technology to read emotions in the classroom is not valuable because it would not work as efficatly as planned, it would give false info, and it would waste time and money.

The use of technology in the classroom would not work as planned because some sutdents would not want to do it. They would not want other people to know what there emotions where all the time. It could maybe even make some students uncomfortable. So the use for all students may just not fit.

Another reason it would not work is because it would give back false information. If one student had a bad day it might say that he dosen't like that class. It could say that he dosent pay attintion in class at all, but one bad day dosent make a kid a bad student. We all have bad days.

The last reason that the use of emotional recognition tech. would not be valuable in the classroom is that it would waste time and money. It would time because it would take extra time for it to read everyone's faces fast enough that it would give accuate results. It would waste money because the device that would read students face would probley cost a fortion. Then the people who et the results may try and charge you for the information.

Thats why i think that the use of technology to read emotions would be a waste of time and money, not be vary effective, and give false information.
