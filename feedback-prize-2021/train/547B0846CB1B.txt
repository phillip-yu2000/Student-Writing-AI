B average? i don't think so.

B average is kind of a lot to ask for i think, i mean half the kids at school get a C average, some even get D's to F's on their report cards.

I'm definitely not one of those all A students C is about a good range on where my grades are.

I know that school is the number one thing to coaches, other than winning.

But we already got enough on our plates with family situations, sports, people we like, a lot of people cant handle getting all that done and still having really good grades.

If you change the grade to a B average, I'm not going to like you possibly might lose a lot of your players for a couple games..

obviously you can't let anyone with a D or F play but i think if a couple players got a C you should just let it slide its not like there failing.

I

mean you really can't expect the whole team to be geniuses, but i think expecting them to be average would be a good call on your part.

All in all if you want to keep most of your players i would highly recommend that you don't higher the average you need to play, and jus keep it at a C average.
