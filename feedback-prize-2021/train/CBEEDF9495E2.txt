Required Essay: Phones & Driving

There are many reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving vehicle. First of all, it can be very dangerous using cell phones while driving. Because when you use cell phone you get distracted with other things you are doing and things around you. When you are driving your focus should be in driving not in your phone or in any other things. There are high chances of you getting into an accident. Furthermore, getting in an accident that might really affect your bank balance and you don't want that. For example, when you hit a car in accident and if it's your fault you have to pay for that person's car repairing and for that person's medical also your insurance will go higher. That will really affect your bank balance. Lastly, I have seen and read most of the people who gets in an accident they are teenagers. Teenagers they keep using phones and driving in the same times that's how most of that accident happens. If you don't care about your own life there is more people who cares about you especially your parents. So at least Think about them before doing something. So there are my top three reasons why no one should use phones while driving.
