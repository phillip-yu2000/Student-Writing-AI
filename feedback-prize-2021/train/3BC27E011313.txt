There are plenty advantages to limiting car use on this Earth. For example, limiting car use can lead to a cleaner environment, better overall health of the people and the Earth, and overall, just a better place to live. Cutting down on car usage can be very benficial for the planet, along with future generations of people.

First, limiting car use can lead to a better place to live in. If we were to slow down on the use of gas, there would be less wars over oil in other countries. We as a race can change the world, one car at a time. Lowering the amount of driving wouldn't be an easy change, but surely one worth while.

Secondly, giving up cars completely might not be necessary, but emitting toxic gas fumes can be easily avoided simply by switching to an electric car. There are many affordable electric cars that can help stop the fumes from traveling into the ozone layer, which can prolong our Earth's life, our lives, and can stop global warming dead in its tracks. Who doesn't want to keep this wonderful weather?

Lastly, cutting down on driving automobiles might have an effectÂ  on saving people from car accidents caused by unfit drivers. Thousands of people die every day from unnecessary car usage. If we were to cut the amount of driving in half, the rate of death due to car accidents would find a steep decline.

In conclusion, limiting car usage can make the world a better place. This decision can lead to better health, less death due to car accidents, prolonging our planet's health, and less complaints about those roller-coaster like gas prices! It only takes one person to make a change, so decide if you want to be the one to potentially save the world.
