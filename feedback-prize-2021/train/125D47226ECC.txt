Dear, Mr. senator

Febuary,3 ,2015

Electoral colleges,what do they do for us? How is this system useful? It's not, the electoral system we use today is mind boggling. Why do we evan use it? Sir the only good outcome is that we do not have to count as much. If we were to use a regular system it would make the people feel as if they were in charge. So many people all think that we should do away with the electoral colleges.

The electoral colleges would be good but what if there is a tie? Should we run another election? I mean who cares right you think of how likely that sounds but if 9,246 pople in Ohio and Hawaii voted the oppisite we would of tied. There are 538 electoral colleges and to tie you would get 269.60 percent of votes would prefer a direct election to the kind we have  now.

To win a election you have to have 270 electoral colleges. The voters sometimes get confused on the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Some electors follow the winner takes all so they dont evan bother with some of the states. The electors that have magority becomes either republican or democrate. Each canididate running for president is either a republican or a democrate.

Sir the electoral colleges are bad because we can have a tie, the people can get confused, and the system does not work for the people . People want to pick there own president. Also the electoral college only helps us were we don't have to do alot of math. These are the reasons i feel that the electoral gollege is no good.

Thank you for hearing my opinion, sincerly ~ PROPER_NAME.
