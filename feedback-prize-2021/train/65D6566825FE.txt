In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus," the author informs us about the many difficulties we would face trying to get a closer look at Venus. Although it is the hottest plant in our solar system with air pressure unlike anywhere on Earth, I believe the auther does a great job explaining how we could overcome the challenges and maybe even send humans to Venus. The author suggests that the humans stay above Venus' atmosphere and lists what technology should be used to send down to the surface of Venus and retreive information about the planet.

The author's first idea to support the claim that we could do more to explore Venus in the near future is keeping the people sent there in a spacecraft, kind of like a blimp, about 30 miles above the surface. The author compares this to how planes fly above storms, which we already know is a good way to complete the task and stay safe. Although the pressure and temperature would still be intense, the astronauts could still do their job under these conditions.

Another suggestion the author does a good job of explaining is thinking about what technology should be sent to the surface to collect samples. In paragraph 7, the author uses examples of what could do the job, such as lab tested tech that could withstand the conditions for weeks and older computers which are stronger than today's. The use of these factually supported examples helps the reader get an idea of what we could send down to Venus and how it could be possible.

The facts the author uses to support their ideas of how we can better explore Venus, along with the descriptive details used to explain these ideas give anyone reading this a better understanding of how we could make this a reality. The ideas that astronauts could stay in safer conditions and send down strong technology to collect the data they need sounds like it could one day be a reality. Until then, we just have to keep exploring ideas to make it one.
