My name is Bob Greene. I am a scientist at Nasa and I am explaining the "Face of Mars" to a man who thinks that this is a sign of an alien artifact. The man continues to argue with me and say that aliens are real and this alien artifact looks like a human face. I have to keep telling him that this is just a natural landform which is called a butte or mesa. This certain mesa looks like a face only because it shows most of the characteristics that a human has such as; the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth which are all just formed by shadows. The man asked how does NASA know that this rock formation that you "supposedly" think, is a mesa? He just thinks that it's a sign of aliens. I tell him that Nasa was able to figure it out because a mesa is a a big rock formation that just has a flat top and thats what the face looked like if you see it up close. He still did not believe me. I told him we will find out and we did.

On April 8, 2001, our team NASA (including me), got a clear picture of this "face". The Mars Global Surveyor went just close enough for a look at the Face which was the perfect cloudless day. NASA was able to get a picture many times more clearer than the 1976 Viking photo.

Many people who thought that the "face" was an alien artifact were waiting to see Nasa release how the picture looks like. Nasa finally revealed that the picture was a... mesa! Many people were dissappointed but some thought that it was just a conspiracy from NASA to keep aliens hidden from people on the outside. I once again saw the man who I argued with years before about the "face". I then told him that his thoughts were wrong but he told me that NASA just wants to keep aliens a secret. Oh boy, here we go again. So finally NASA officially said that this was just a illusion of a face that people had.
