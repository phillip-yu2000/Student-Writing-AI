Is it fine to ask more than one person for advice? If so, then why? When I was in elementary school, I wanted some advice of being a successful person in the future. Not only I asked my mom, but also my dad, friends, teachers, and relatives for their opinions. Because of that, it led me become the person who I truly am today, a proud, successful student at Generic_School. So I believe that seeking advice from more than one person can help you do better choices in the future because of the loads of advice others have and the experience of other people.

First of all, someone might ask as many people as possible for some advice. Which is an excellent step because you got many options to choose from. Some people might even say the same advice you heard before, which means that it could be worth a shot. Many people might come up with the most helpful advice they would ever give. This is a good reason why you should ask loads of people for advice you never tried before.

Second of all, you want to know the experience of other people. How does this help you? When you ask many people for advice, they'll give some from what they experienced and how they affected their future. They could also give you even better advice than the ones they used, so that you can become more successful than them. It's also good when it comes to mistakes. Many people will tell you what to do, so that you wouldn't end up in a bad situation, just like them. Just ask anybody who experienced things before.

In General, it's best to ask more than one person for some advice because they'll give you loads of advice and what they experienced from using it. Remember that you're not alone. Don't be scared of asking as many people as you like for some tips of doing better choices or of being successful. Eventually, you'll know what to do later on in life.
