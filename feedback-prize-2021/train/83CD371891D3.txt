Seagoing Cowboys Program is a program, where you take care of horses, calfs (young cows), and mules, that were shipped over sea. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have to travel to a lot of unquine countries around the world. Luke Bomberger was a Seagoing Cowboy and, by the time it was 1947 he made nine trips. Luke's second trip was that he had to serve as a night watchman, who checks on the animals every hour.

We know now that, not everyone would like to be a Seagoing Cowboy, but while you are traveling, there are many new countries you could explore and learn about. It does take a long time to get to other countries, it would take about two weeks because they have to travel in boat, if your going by sea. It would be a tedious amount of time to get to place to place and nobody likes a tedious task. Luke had to make sure that he didn't forget to feed the animals because,you have to feed them two or three times a day. They had to get loads of bales of hay and bags of oats from other ships that transfer the food to him, and you would have to clean the stalls. Some don't about joining this program is that, when you are traveling you, may get stuck in some storms and really hurtful storms too.

Although, there is a lot of traveling, it maybe worth the work because, you got to see new countrires and new landscapes. Luke Bombgerger worked hard and he loved seeing all the new cities and countries, but struggles traveling. There is many up and downs about joining the program, literally, because not everyone likes traveling, but a lot of people do. Now we have airplanes so, if you travel it will be easier for you to get to other countries. In the end, it is going to be easier for you to travel, now that we have airplanes, but you should join Seagoing Cowboys.
