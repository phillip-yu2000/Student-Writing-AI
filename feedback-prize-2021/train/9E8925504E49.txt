Dear Principal,

I agree that you should change the school's policy so kids would have to have a B average to participate in sports or other activities.

It could help some kids in a lot of ways.

I think that if you change the policy then most kids would have better grades.

Also it would probably help the kids in the future to get into college and have better careers.

I think they would all try to do better if they had to get a B average to play a sport because most people are involved in sports or other activities.

I think that if that rule was changed then the kids would be more motivated to do better.

Also I think that you would be helping them.

The kids probably wouldn't like it at first, but I think that it would be good for them.

I think that if the kids knew that they had to do better to be able to do something that they wanted to do then they would be able to get better grades.

I think that most people would try a lot harder to do better to be in a sport.

I also think that if the kids knew that they could get good grades that they would feel better about themselves.

I think that if you made this a rule then the kids will be able to accomplish something that they might not think that they could before.

I think that it is a smart idea to change the school policy so you would have to get better grades to play a sport or do other activities.

I think you should change the policy so the kids will do better in school and go further in life.

If you change this rule I think that even if some kids aren't happy about it now they will be later.

If you changed this rule then you will probably be helping a lot of kids.
