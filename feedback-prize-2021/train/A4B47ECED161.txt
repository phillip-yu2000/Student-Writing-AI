Dear Principal,

I think that policy 2 is the better policy because I don't understand the need for cell phones all the time. I understand that you may have some type of emergency and if you need to contact your parents or other family members for help, then I'm sure your school has a phone that you can use.

If kids were given the right to have phones at school all the time, I am almost positive that they would not only use them during lunch and other free periods, but whenever they wanted to. They would listen to music and text friends that are in a different school or in a different room. This would cause them to get into trouble and also the person that they are texting would get into trouble.

Having no phones at all is the best policy because without them there is less of a chance for you to get into trouble and having it taken away from you. There are less distractions and more time to focus on school work without a cell phone.

Thank you,
