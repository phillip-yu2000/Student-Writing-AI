Dear principal,

I think that it is a wonderful idea to do community service in the neighborhood. But i don't think that it should be required of us to do community service. It should be whither we want to or not. Because some of the students aren't going to do it no matter what you or a teacher says.

Me I would be able to do some community service. whether it is helping someone with a grandchild or pet or going grocery shopping for them. I would be able to do that. But most of them won't do yard work or most of those things that i just said. There to lazy to do things for others.

There are some students who I think would do community service. Because they go to church and are use to do things like that. But most of them won't even pick up a rack to rack there own yard. So how are they going to do that for someone else. I really don't know .

There schedule revolves around them selves. There video games and cell phones. That is what there lives surround. Themselves and there electronics. That is all they care about. Them selves and no one else. So I think that making everybody do community services is a bad idea because your not going to have a lot of people helping out. But maybe if you make it during school they will.

So do it during school. Field trip you might get a little bit more. Make it a time when they are away from there electronics. Maybe you will get more out of them . they have to be at school any way. so why not make it fun. You don't even need a bus you could walk around and go door to door. Asking people if they need anything.

I'm pretty sure that you might get some people that need help. You could do it class by class on a nice sunny day in the summer time when we come back to school. I'm sure that people will help out if you say that there getting out of school for a day. It doesn't even have to be a week worth of community service it can be a day.
