Vroom! Beep! They everywhere. Cars. People use them everyday to get back and forth to work, school, and other places needed. You may think you need them in everyday life , but their are advantages to limiting car usage in a town.

One advantage to limit car usage is that its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Cars release gasses and toxins with odors into the air that we breath. No one really wants to breath in toxins and bad air that can possibly cause heath problems .

Riding a bike can reduce air pollution . It also can take away stress and help with weight loss or burning calories if you are trying to stay healthy and fit.

Another advantage is not having to pay gas and worrying about gas prices. Money for paying for gas canadd up ove time. That money can be used towards something else important such as bills . Gas also goes back to the pollution problem. Not driving a car and having to pay for gas can reduce that problem.

And last, Limiting driving can limit traffic . No one likes to sit in traffics for hours after a long day at work or at school.
