Driverless cars are obviously cars without drivers. Many have envisioned such an idea as revolutionary like Sergey Brin. As a matter of fact google has bulit such cars since 2009. However some people see this as a flawed idea and see this as a bad thing. I'm honestly split about each side.

Driverless cars do have a lot of positives. They are ecologicly friendly, so they save both gas and money. Also, they are way more flexible than a bus could be, since it can go anywhere. Not to mention they are way more safer than normal vehicles, alerting people who are distracted by anything while on the road. Speaking of safety, that seems to be a marjor area that is adressed. For instance, when there is a problem the car would state it and giver the passenger the option to take over. Another way is the cars expensive sensors that detect when there's going to be a problem, and automaticly breaks the car to avoid any damage.

However, there is some glaring issues that must be adressed. First off people will get bored beccause they are passengers. Plus being alarmed of this everytime your dozing off, by the car itself, isn't going to help anyone, just annoy them. On top of this driving cars is a rite of passage into adulthood. Taking that freedom away is just wrong. Not to mention, whos to blaim in an accident involving two of these things from different companies. It's stated in the paragraph that new laws must be made for these kinds of cases, and that could take years.

In conclusion, I'm split about this idea. Driverless cars might be the next evolution for the motor companies, but it is flawed in some rather serious degrees.
