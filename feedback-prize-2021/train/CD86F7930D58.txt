To the school principle,

I think that policy number 1 is good because it gives a little freedom to communicate with friends. Either for a class project that needs to be done, for a favor, or just chatting. but at the same time its better only when there is free time or during lunch.

The first policy is good because like said before it can actually be for something important. it can be for a project, homework or anything school related. sometimes even just to chat with some friends. But that's where its the free time when you can not just in middle of a teachers learning.

For me personally this is a good policy. its good because it actually is a good deal for the teacher and students. It gives students the freedom to use cell phones to communicate, but during some free time they have as in to not disturb their learning process, and it lets the teacher be calm without thinking her students are using them during class.

Even if the second policy is chosen I think we should be able to use phones because if you need to find a friend and your having trouble finding him/her, and lets say its for a project, then there's going to be a problem.

But back to the first policy, you can actually help your teacher in some way by using a cell phone. Like if you have internet on your phone you can look something up for your teacher and help instead of starting up a computer or even not looking for it.

so hopefully this helps you decide which policy to choose for the school. but once again the first can really be good for students and teachers.
