Have you ever asked for advice? If you answered yes, did you ask more than one person? Well I'll tell why it's important to ask more than one person for advice. There are many advantages for asking more people they can have aÂ different point of view, and you can trust the act more because there can be more people saying the same thing.

Asking multiple people for advice will give you different opinions and options. Different point of views allows you to have a second opinion. This could be asking both your mom and your dad, and they could help you pick out your shoes if you can't decide between the "Kyrie 6 Pre-Heat New York City" and the "KD 12 All-Star Don-C". Asking more than one person gives you different paths to take and gives more opportunities. Different people have different tastes from vacation spots to what sports they like to play. An addition to that, there personalities come in play as well. If they are given a task they could have different ways on completing it.

The next reason is trusting the opinion more. If there are more people that have the same idea you will trust it more. If you ask more people the more options you will get, and some of them could overlap and be connected. Majority is a big part in making a choice it can pressure you in a good way and a bad way. For example if you do not have enough money to buy somethings yo can be pressured to steel it. Instead an alternative option is to talk to your mom or a trusted adult about it before steeling. I think you should talk about it and ask before you act because it can clear up some misconceptions and help you make a better choice.

To finish it up these are some big ways that seeking multiple opinions can help. You can get more opinions on your idea and make a better choice. This is why getting multiple opinions is benifitical.
