Is this technology that is able to read students' emotional expressions valuable?

I think the value of using this technology to read the students' emotions is really important. It is important because you can determain if students show some sort of depression in there life and you can be able to help them prevent suicide. " A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored." This would help the teacher be able to help students out or try to teach them in a different way so it doesn't seem so bored or confusing.

This new technology can help in so many different ways. Us oursleves may or may not see how another person is feeling, we might think they are feeling happy but deep inside they can be sad. That's where the new technology part comes in, it is able to see what a person is truly feeling like for an exmaple the Mona Lisa painitng. " She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry." This was all determined by the Facial Action Coding system.

Like I said in the beginning "Is this technology that is able to read students' emotional expereinces valuable?" I know it is and hopefully you'll understand what I'm trying to say.
