The "face" on Mars was not created by aliens however it is just a natural landform that was created. "As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size," he added. "So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"

The land form known as the "Face on Mars" is just a Mesa. On Earth we have these mesas too. "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."

Even though it may look like an artifact its not because it was just formed like that. The mesa has nothing to hide becaus eour satelights have take many pictures of this mesa and this is no evidence of an alien presence on Mars. There are no sybols of any kind on or near the face or shacks or anything that could lead to the conclousion that aleins had built the face.

This is my evidence that the "Face on Mars" is just a common landform that was misconceived as a face of sorts built by aliens. Even though it may just be a common landform it is hard to belive this is not an artifact from an anceint civilization that lived on Mars.
