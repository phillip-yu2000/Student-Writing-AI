Dear principal,

I would like to change the grade average for sports. The change in grade average for sports is a B average. Most students who participate in sports have C average. The change for the B average is imperative and it will help students in many ways.

Many students can be in sports and still do good in school the change would be just to raise the it one grade higher. This can help the students and help them raise grades in their other classes. Having a B average can help kids work harder to stay in sports. If the students really want to be in sports or other activities then they will do what is takes to stay in the clubs or sports.

Activities need to be earned in some cases. There are many kids who are gifted with a certain talent. The thing is that you need to be doing good in school to do those certain sports or activities. When some kids are not right for that sport it does not mean that they can't do well in other classes, such as math, literature, and even maybe making history.

In conclusion I think that we should change the grade average to a B average. Having a C average can So that kids can do better in school and better in life.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
