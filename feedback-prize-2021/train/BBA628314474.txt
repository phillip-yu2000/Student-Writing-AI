The electoral college is a process that has been used since the first president was elected. Now it is being questioned as a rational way to elect the next presidents. The author of the article "The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong", Bradford Plumer, argues that the electoral college is unfair and outdated, while the author of the artcle "In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president", Richard A. Posner, gives five reasons to why we should keep the electoral college. Though the method of electing a president is refered to as a "non-democratic method" it is an extremely important way to decide our nation's president.

Of course there are reasons why the electoral college should be abolished. Plumer argues, "the Louisiana legislature nearly succeedeed in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy." Because of the replacement the popular wouldn't have gone to Kennedy.
