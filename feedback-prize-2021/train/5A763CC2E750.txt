All of our devolpment since World War II has been centered on the car and that will have to change

," said David Golberg. Now this is true, cars have been a fluenctal idea  for  transportation. Cars is known to be the fastest way of transportatin, but maybe limiting car usage can be helpful. Theres thousands of alternatives like bicking, skating, running, ridding a bus, or even a train. limiting car usage would save the money you use on gas, reduce the ammount of polution in our atmosphere, and is more healthy for your body. Heres my explanation to why limiting car usage would be a productive idea.

Our nation spends millons on gas each week, limiting car usage would save that money. The amount of money people spend on gas is astonishing. Limiting car usage by taking a buss or even using a bike could save that money. In my community there is this parking lot for buss takers, this way people can save money on gas and still get to there destination on time. Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it will reduce polution.

Polution is a huge problem not just for Europe or North America, but for the entire world. According to source 2 "Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog." In France they use diesel fuel which is the most polluted fuel there is. Paris put a banned on ussages of their cars, this led to 4,000 driveres being fined.
