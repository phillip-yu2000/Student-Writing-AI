Schools that offer students to do classes online or by other means are great for students who have problems whether they medical, physical or other.

Students with medical problems like a sickness that can be spread around. Students with physical problems like a heart condition or are disabled in certain areas that prevent them to get to schools even if some schools have a form of transportation made for them they may feel uncomfortable with students who are not. Students withÂ problems such as anxiety and other such condition can prevent the students from coming to school.

One other problem that cause students to learn at home could be the parents as some don't trust the school to keep their children safe or they do not believe they teach their children properly and may want to hire someone else.

These reasons are why I think this type of learning can benefit students who learn like this as it can give them a comfortable environment to learn in whether or not they have a condition.
