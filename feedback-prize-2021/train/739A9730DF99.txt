Conspiracy theorists think that the Face was built by aliens. However, they are wrong. They are wrong for many reasons. One reason is as simple as can be and that is that there is no proof that aliens have ever touched foot on to one of the galaxy's planets. The Face is just a natrual landform.

In addition, scientists have already come to the conclusion that the Face is just a Martian mesa. "Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah" (2). This proves that it is just unusal for a Martian mesa to look like the one on Mars. "Martian mesa, common enough"(2) this proves that Martian mesa's are common and not unusal.

Plus in the pictures the Face is not the only mesa around. There are 10 different mesas. If there are ten mesas in one picture of Mars who knows how many mesas are on Mars(5). It is just a fluke that one mesa happens to look like an Egpytian Pharoah.

Also Is says in the story that "what the picture actaully shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mess--landforms common around the American West"(12). Garvin says "It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"(12). There is buttes and messas on Earth what makes conspiarcy therorists think that there can not be natrual ones on Mars to. The fact the conspiracy theorists actaully belive that aliens built the Face is a joke.

The Face is a natrual landform on Mars that happens to look like a face. We know this becasue scientists have proven it. We also know this because there are messas on planet earth. Lastly we know this because they cant prove that aliens ever stepped foot onto mars or even constructed a messa. The Face is a fluke.
