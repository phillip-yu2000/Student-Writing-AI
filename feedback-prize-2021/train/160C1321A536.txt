Dear Principle,

I think that your consideration of changing the school policy is completely unfair to the students, teachers, and coaches here at our school. For many students, maintaining a grade B average is almost impossible. If most students have a grade C average, don't you think that if would be most logical to set the standard at a grade C? I do understand that academics come first and i respect that, but i also feel that many students may not feel a need to keep their average at a grade C because without sport eligibility, there is no need to. There is also the issue of coaches losing their jobs because there are not enough children to play that sport. As for the students that can maintain a grade B average, this policy change could also effect them negatively as well. Without enough children to play on a team, those who have at least a grade B average will not be able to play either because there may not be enough of these students to create a full team. Also, clubs and extracurricular activities may have to be cancelled because of the lack of eligible participants. It is very good for students to be able to experience things outside of academics. With this new policy, many students will not have that experience available to them. Please take all of these examples into consideration when making your final decision.

Thanks.

A concerned student
