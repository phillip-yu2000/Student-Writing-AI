Driverless cars are accomplishing many goals and it won't be to long until they will be in full function.

As a part of this I think that it is time to accept change.

The cars will have a few bugs at the start but won't be a problem for long term.

Automated cars should be able to be developed because of the tests that have positive results, the improvement in sensors, and the safety backing them up.

Cars can be very dangerous, escpecially if you put a computer behind it.

However the smart cars from Google had been driven a half a million miles without a crash.

This result shows how advanced technology has become and how it can be very realiable.

With more tests showing positive results it should be no problem for people to see that the cars are really something special.

Another reason for automated cars to be developed is because of the improvement in sensors.

Now that sensors can be very realiable and are getting cheaper and cheaper it wasn't a bad thought to use them in cars.

Many sensors that are put on the car are used for different purposes.

Some sensors are so improved that they keep a 3-D model of the car's surrounding.

This is important because it will be able to detect when danger is near.

Finally, the last reason automated cars should be developed is because of the safety that will be involved with it.

The automated cars will have key safety features to keep the driver and everyone around them safe.

One of these features is to tell the driver when to take over. Others include stopping when closing in on an object and turning off displays when the driver has to take control.

Will automated cars be developed?

I think they will but only if we let improvement happen.

Automated cars do seem a little fetched out but its important to see the positives.

With all the results from tests, advances in sensors, and key safety features automated cars would be a huge improvement that might just be safer than actual drivers.
