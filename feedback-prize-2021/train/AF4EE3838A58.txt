Creating these driverless cars are amazing, but with technology today, it will need a lot of security systems, the car has many cameras to it but if one bad person who knows a lot about those cars, they will try to hack into it, if they succeced, it could do harm on the streets. People can hack into bank accout with ease, by only a couple of numbers, if the people who create these driverless cars don't understand that, then many cars are going to be hijacked or worse.

Many of these cars can also have a malfunction also, no matter if they say it will, if any of the sensors that are on the car gets hit, then it may malfunction. Would the car need an upgrade just like a computer? My computer take a very long while and multiple tries for it to successivly upgrade and i only had it for a year, would that same thing happen to the cars? It says in the text that the cars would use half of the fuel today, would it be priced right to even sell? Many people have had the same car for many years and never had a accident in it, some people would have the money, some people don't, if the people who create the driverless cars must know a good price where they can make a living and keep making more and the buyers are pleased with the price and how well they are developed. If the cars become semi-automatic, if a person sleeps on the interstate, how long will the car go before i needs a human to take the wheel? Many people get injured or worse by falling asleep behind the wheel and I hope that the driverless car will solve that problem.
