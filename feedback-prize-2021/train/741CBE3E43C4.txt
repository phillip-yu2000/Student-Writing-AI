I do because we dont have to come to school and we can do are work at home at in time and if we work in the morning we can do are school work when we get home work and we dont have to sit for hour in a class room when we can do are work at home and like we can sleep long and do are work at in time and still pass if we do good on are work at home but some kids have to work a lot so that is good for them at home school were they can still pass and still work and have school in them.

But some moms and dads dont think its good for them kids but it is because if they have to work then can still do there school work when they get home and still have time to do them and can sleep more and dont have to get up at 6am in the morning and they can hang with there friend when there done with work but they might be a little sad because they dont get to see there friends as much when there at home doing there school work but i world love to do my work at home were i dont have to be in class all day with people because i really dont like being i rooms with a lot if people in the class rooms and one my friend say in more easy dont your work at home because you feel more safe at home with your mom are dad can help you when you need help.

Some people it hard for them to work with people in there class rooms when they dont know them as much and its just hard for them to get a hang of it and it not okay for them so working at home is good for people like that it will help them more and if they work in a class room with kids in there they might not pass so if they work at home it will help them more so they can pass.

i just dont know in more to say like that is all i have i am srr
