Hi I'm Michael, and I will be talking too you about Seagoing Cowboys. In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves it talks about Luke and it takes on a journy that he had. A Seagoing Cowboy is a person that transport animals across the sea to other countrys and states. You get to sail the world by bost with animals.

When, you sail the world you see so much more and meet a lot more people. If you sail the world it is a beatiful thing to see with your eyes before you die. You get to see how others live and the animals. Plus world beond the state you live because life is so much more.

Plus when you become a Seagoing Cow boy you get to see and meet all kinds of different animals. It opens your mind too other animals and where they live. You can deliver animals from lizards to tigers all types of animals. On your why back too home all the creates with animals are gone so you get to play games. Like it said in the story they play volleyball and have table tennis touraments and best of all baseball.

Just imangine seeing all the different animals and places. Just like in the story exchange visitors you will see and get to meet. Plus playing those games with your friends and having fun. Thats why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy.
