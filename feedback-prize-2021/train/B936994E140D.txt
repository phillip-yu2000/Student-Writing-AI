I agree that students would benefit better on taking online classes and video conferencing at home. Most of the students prefer online classes because they can't get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benfit students in a way that their will be less distraction and work in your own level. Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.

For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school.

There are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they can't due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example,

you won't have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home.

Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends

I feel like it benfits most of teens in the world. Not all teens get to have education due to many reasons which is why I feel like it can benefit many teens in taking classes at home.
