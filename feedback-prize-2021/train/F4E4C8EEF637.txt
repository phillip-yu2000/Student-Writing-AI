Dear Principal,

I think that Policy 1 is the best for teachers because if students are using there phones during school hours that's just a distraction. Its the best policy for students too because they don't need to use cell phones during school hours or in classes. It is also a very good policy so teachers wont have to worry about the students not paying attention in class or like texting or taking pictures or something else. Its also a good thing for teachers so the phones don't ring in class and its also a good thing for students so students don't get their cell phones taken away.

Teachers wont have to worry about students talking in the restroom with cell phones or just having the phones. Teachers wont worry anymore because students wont have to hide to use their phones during the school hours just because they feel like using their cell phones. The math teachers wont have to worry because they will know that the students are using their brains and not technology for their answers. Students would also be less supervised by using technology during school hours. Being able to use your phone in the free periods is a right thing for students but during classes its just not a right thing to do, because cell phones could ring at anytime if you don't turn of the volume down.
