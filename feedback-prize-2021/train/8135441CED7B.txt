Dear Principle

I truly believe it would benefit a students daily life at school if they could use there cell phones during there free time. In this letter i will expand on this idea and why I believe that it is true. Hopefully you will consider it.

First of all i believe that with cell phones at lunch or break would prevent students from being tempted to take them out in class. With there phones out during there free time they will students could be more social with other students teaching them a valuable life lesson. Because students will be able to use them during free time, they will feel as though they do not have to use them during class time. Saving both the teacher and the students some trouble.

Also, i believe that it would benefit the noise level. Being able to use phones at lunch or other free periods would take more attention off of talking and more on texting or other applications that a cell phone has.

With all of the noise gone from the lunchroom or break area teachers could get more done with the day then waiting around looking to get people into trouble. Lastly of this idea every day i see teachers complaining that, a students phone went off in class, well if we could use them during free time maybe that wouldn't happen.

Finally, i will say that with cell phones there could also be better working conditions for teachers as well as students. With cell phones, teacher would be able to use that as a work device they could save time, they could be used to call an important person or a speaker to talk to there class, and teachers will be able to do work that would be unavailable to them on a computer .

Those were just some ideas to change your mind about cell phone usage. Please consider the students, and not just them but yourself as well.

Sincerely yours, SCHOOL_NAME students
