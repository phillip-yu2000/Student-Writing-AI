Relatively autonomous cars represent a great advance in technology, as it is observed in society today. Even though this technology represents a relatively large effective range, I am not for the use of mostly or fully autonomous technologies. Even though the use of machines and technologies for the enrichment of the human populace is important, allowing them to affect our place at the wheel will not be beneficial to the coming generations. By allowing these technologies to supercede the need for the human driver/passenger to actively think, we take away from our own capacities of understanding and adapting to the simplest of situations.

In paragraph 7, it is discussed how in 2013, BMW had developed a vehicular system called "Traffic Jam Assistant", which was capable of autonomously operating effectively at speeds up to 25 mph. This being said, there are sensors on the steering wheel that assure that the driver does not release the wheel. Also, when there are area-specific conditions, such as construction zones and accidents, the driver must take control when indicated. If so much input is required from the human driver, then why should we relinquish the wheel to these vehicles in the first place?

Information from various sources have indicated that when oneself is not exposed to the full extent of certain processes, it is more likely for errors to occur later. In other words, if a person is presented with a task or job largely dependant on technological assistance, and they are later given the same job, but without the 'tech support', then they are more likely to fail at the task. If we were to allow the coming generations to initially utilize these technologies in their everyday lives, as these technologies develop and progress, then they would be impaired in a situation where they would not drive a relatively autonomous vehicle. In short, the use
