Why should a kid have a cell phone at school well there are numerous reasons why.

A kid might need to call his mom to ask her can she bring the paper that he left on the counter.

I think the principal should let the students have the phones but it also have to be rules to have phones. you should have them either on vibrate or silent and no one should see you on the phone to the appropriate time. if the phone is caught out it should be taken and give to and adult. other than that i think its okay for students to have phone a lot is going on around the world wouldn't you want a phone?.

you would always have to rember that education come first before anything. cell phones can be a distraction to some people because they don't no how to handle it . maybe the upper students can handle it better than the trouble makers. i say to my principal give everyone a chance and if the whole phone situation don't work this time than you can go to option number 2 and that's to have no phones at all. that's my idea on the whole thing maybe you think different im just telling you what i see and hear everyday since i am a student here at the school.
