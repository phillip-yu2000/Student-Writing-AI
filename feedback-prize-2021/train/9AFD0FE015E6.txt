Phones and Driving Essay

There are two items people in the world can't wait to get. A car and a phone. Both are very much needed on today's day and age. A car to get you to where you need to go, and, a phone to contact people. But let me say this, they both DO NOT go well together.

My first reason for why people should not be able to use their phones while they drive is that it is dangerous. You are driving a metal box going 60+ miles down the road. There's nothing to stop you from turning slightly to the right and hitting a two-ton semi-truck or going to the left and coming into oncoming traffic. You need to keep 100% attention to the road just in case some maniac does decide to do that or if someone slams on brakes in front of you. Using your phone while driving takes some of that attention off from the road which is dangerous to yourself and other drivers around you.

Now what are the benefits of texting and driving? Texting someone back? Posting a snapchat on time? The dangers of texting and driving far outweigh the benefits. Now the most leading cause of death for teenage drivers is texting and driving according to www. integrityinsurance. com. That text or that snap can wait till you get home.

My final reason for why you shouldn't text, and drive is that it is illegal. If all the reasons I explained earlier could not get you to stop then maybe this will. If you are seen texting and driving by a police officer, you can get in various amounts of trouble according to which state you are in. In some states it is a fine that ranges from 50-500$. In other states it can result in criminal misdemeanor charges or and evil jail time.

Now that you have heard my reasons for how texting and driving is dangerous and even deadly, you too need to take a stand. Tell a friend or family member that you know texts and drives that they need to stop. Now.
