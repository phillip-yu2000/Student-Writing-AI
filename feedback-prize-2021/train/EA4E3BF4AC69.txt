In 1976 images taken by NASA's Viking 1 have shocked the media. These images show an object on Mars that resembles a faces. These images have surprised the media and cuased a large reaction.

These are images of a mesa on Mars. They are closely related to the mesas we have on Earth. The "face" is actually shadows giving the illusion of a nose, eyes, and mouth on the mesa. They released these pictures to the public hoping it would sensationalize Mars. They hoped it would help make Mars more interestion. Well the images did just that. People stared to believ that there was life on Mars. They believed that the face was made by aliens, dispite the research proving it was just an illusion. Conspracy theorist belived that the illusion explanation was just a cover up. Yet, why would NASA cover it up. If this would be real NASA would get an extreme increase in popularity and funding. They would only benefit from it. NASA even took another voyage to prove it was jut a rock formatioon.

Although NASA has proven time and time again that it is not actually a face, people are still esceptical. People believ that the goverment is hidding something from us. These ideas are ludicris. Look at the facts. The goverment or NASA wouldn't benifit from a rock formation as much as they would from a prove of life on Mars. The rumors about the face are just that, rumors.
