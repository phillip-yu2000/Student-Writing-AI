Fellow citizens...we are working on limiting car usage.

By limiting car usage we will be reducing the amount of pollution. We'll also be making the air safer and reducing the stress that having a car produces. In a small town in Germany they don't even drive cars.

Our cities are are becoming polluted because of our car usage. In paris they ordered motorists with even license plates to leave their cars at home or pay a fine. There were almost 4,000 drivers that got a fine.

In Bogota, Colombia they had a car free day. This ment that everyone would go 1 day without using their car. This program helped avoid traffic jams. They had a large turnout. Day without cars helped parks and sports centers bloom throughout the city.

"Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by." In america, the rate at which americans drive is decreasing.       Â
