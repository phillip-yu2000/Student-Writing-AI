I agree because they can do at least one activity for school like a sport,clubs,even staying after for a teacher. Things like that people should stayed after school to finish a test or finish project things like this people should do.

Things i'll so if i stayed after school will be homeworke,sports things maybe helping out with the school staying after school will be helpful sometimes to you and sometimes to the school and it can be helpful to get your grades up and all of that stuff. Staying after is like useing your time on your stuff that are helpful.

The other reasons why people stayed after school is for sports and clubs these are the most common things that people stay after is sports and clubs. clubs are things that are fun to do and more active in the school thing some of these stuff is more doing something for the school or you. Sports are mostly playing for your team or school sometimes people do it for fun and try get to people to like it and try to play the sport or some other sport try to be good at it and have a future with the sport that you use to played on.

People stayed after because they want ot hang out or finish a test,project things like that and for my reasons i think everyone should try one thing after school and of they dont like it they dont like it but i think they shouls because they're so many things to do after school that are fun and some are boring to do like for example some people cna planed the dance for school or planed a field trip that thwy wnated to go or have fun at least or make a holiday why students at that school cant go because some type of hoilday after be fun and thats why i think you should stayed after school.
