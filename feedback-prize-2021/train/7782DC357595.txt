Dear Principal,

In my opinion students should be allowed to bring phones to school and use them during lunch or other free times in school as long as the phones are turned of in class. One example of why this is necessary would be if an emergency comes up and the student needs to inform their parent or guardian. Or vice versa if the parent needs to inform their child about a situation. Cell phones are a vital object in today's society. Most people depend on cell phones even tough they are not always helpful.

I know what your thinking, if we let students bring cell phones to school they will get distracted and ignore their teachers. That could easily be solved with simple punishments. Such as if a student is caught using their phone during class without permission the student will get their phone taken away. Most students care for their phones and will not risk the chance of losing their cell phone. If the problem continues other arrangements including informing their parents about the situation could also help.

In other terms if you let the students bring their phones to school with more freedom they will feel more trustworthy and there for follow the rules. I know all students will appreciate this eff
