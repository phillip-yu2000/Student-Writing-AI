Dear, Principal

I honestly think we should be able to bring our phones to school but only to use them for emergencies only. But i mean it would be nice to be able to use our phones during school hours but yet during free time and lunch time. I think if we were really able to use phones in school it would never be a bore in school what so ever. But some students in school have serious lack of concentration and being able to use phones in school would make it even more worse than it already is. So i mean of course I'm going to choose policy 1 because what teenager do you know that wouldn't want to bring their cell phones to school and actually be able to use it during school hours.

Because as you can see in the video even if were not allowed to use our phones there are some that tend to use it anyway. Even while the teacher is teaching but most uses books to cover up their phones or wait until the teacher isn't looking or walking down the hall. I mean cell phones are really like teens drugs you can really get attached to it or just cant help yourself and you really have to text that person back. But me personally I don't really use my phone in school i might wait until gym while were in the locker rooms to text them back. But I'm not going to text during class unless its my mom and its really important and that's when i might just lift my book up and text away but other than that i keep my phone either in my book bag or my pocket.
