This will be about my opinions and what I think on the matter of driverless cars.

I will explain why I think like I do too.

I think you will agree with me.

I think driverless cars would be good and nice.

Some computers can detect danger faster than the human eye can catch, or the human mind to comprehend.

For example if a small animal runs in front of your car you may hit it due to you driving so fast, and the sudden relization that an animal just ran out in front of your car.

Another plus of driverless cars are you are less likely to get injured due to the computer inside your car.

For example, say you are driving and you are extremely tired from a long days work.

If you fall aslepp at the wheel, the car will stop due to your hands no longer on the wheel of the car, resulting in a safe stop.

This is my opinion on why driverless cars would be safer. There are many dangers as well, but I belive the pros outweigh the cons in this situation.

I hope the reader of this will belive the same way after reading what I just typed.
