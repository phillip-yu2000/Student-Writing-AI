Dear, principal

Making it so that students can not play sports, because of there grade average is a good idea, but I think a C average is enough for a student to play as long as they keep it up and do better. I think if you take away sports then it will just make them think that, well since they have nothing to worry about then they don't need to work harder to bring up their grade. Taking away the sports is a bad idea for one kids need to be active and two so that they have something to do besides sit home and watch T.V, talk on cell phones, and be on the computer kids need to be active for their health, just because of their C average does not mean that they wont try if they know that if they don't they will be kicked of the team. A, average higher than a D is a good enough grade for students and so I don't agree on the thought of sports being taken away from them so, I am against your decision. Students should have a chance at participating in sports at school with a C grade average. Taking away other activities is a bad idea, because students look forward to the activities that the schools have. So my opinion on both subjects is said sports and other activities should not be taken away from the students.

Sincerely,
