Dear TEACHER_NAME our school should be able to perform community service cause it looks good on our back ground, it cleans our community, and it brings our community together.

First reason why i think we should be able to do community service is cause it looks good on our back ground. So suppose you go to a athletic school and they look at your background to see if your good enough or did anything good an if they seen you done nothing they wouldn't want you. Don't you believe if you were to have that you've done community service our a period that you'll get more acceptince letters than you having nothing on you're back ground.

Second reason i think we should be able to perform community service is cause it cleans our community. Really who wasn't to live in an neighbor hood with trash every where i wouldn't so why let us walk around in trash roaming the streets, why let it when we can do something about it. We could clean up and make neighbor hoods a safer environment for our kids, so you wont have to worry bout them goin out side playing with open canes.

Last reason why i think we should be able to do community service is cause it brings our community closer. Who wants to wake up 3 in the morning to see a face you never seen before but that same face lives rite in front of you, or you come home to see your kids in the house every after noon because they don't have friends or they don't no any body. I remember the time i stayed in the house cause i had no friends and it wasn't fun. if we clean up together everyday we'll start making friends and having fun cleaning every day with formiller faces then you wont have to stay in the house cause you have no friends now you can go outside so absolutely wouldn't you want us to do community service.

In conclusion we should have community service cause it looks good on our back grounds, it cleans our community, and it brings our community together. So now do you see why i want our school to have community service.
