Dear Principal,

I believe all students should not have to complete community service tasks .I believe all students should have the option weather or not they want to put in physical labor for their community .Any student who puts in work for the community should otherwise be rewarded for their effort .Also for the students who choose not to participate in these efforts will have to be an inhabitant to the problems and concerns .everyone should have the option and have the right to take act on their choice .

For any and every student who chooses to take part in the clean up or involvement in bettering young children education I feel they should be rewarded . In the form of a game night , party , or even a cook-out perhaps .The children who fight and feel the need to have a safe ,healthy ,smart ,concerned community should be taken care of in a fun way .Because they take time away from their fun. This will maybe even show other children how important it is to do the same and might have a positive influence on them.

As for the students who choose not to take time away from their social lives to make a better community should not be punished or held on a lower pedestal .They should be treated the same and they should be able to realize on their own the opportunities they're missing out on .If there is a certain in -school activity that they will miss out on then that is a way that they can be influenced to participate .But there are some students who can't or aren't able to help the community .No-one should really have to explain themselves because the fact of the matter is if they choose to live in this type of community and live in this type of environment then they have to deal with the consequences.
