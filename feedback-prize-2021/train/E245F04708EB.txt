People should join the program because the Seaagoing cobows are trying to fight the country and end WW2. But after the war you could do fun things. Luke's inventor was fun because he got to travel.

Luke's claim is its alright to be Seagoing Cowboy is fun but sometimes it just feels good to be still alive after the war. Seagoing cowboys are trying to help other people to get food so they can survive.

The Sea going Cowboys are good for the world because they save people's life.

Luke had made 9 trips over the world and the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. Sea going Cowboys ride on cattle-boat so they can go around the world. The Seagoing Cowboys help 44 nations to joind together to make the UNRRA.

My conclusion is people should join the Seagoing Cowboys because they help people and 44 nation joind together to make the UNRRA.The Seagoing Cowboys ended WW2 and they traveled 9 trips with cattle-boat to get around. Luke is a good Seagoing Cowboy because he helps his aunt Katies farmas a boy. But being a Seagoing Cowboy was muc more o an aventure for Luke Bomberger. Lukke also found fun oplaying baseball,table tennis,fencing and boxing.
