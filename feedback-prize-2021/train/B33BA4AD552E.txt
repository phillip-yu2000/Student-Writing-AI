Dear State Senator, I am writting to inform you, that we need to change the fact that we have Ellectoral colleges and go to a popularity vote for presidancy. I feel that more people would vote if they new that their vote actualy made a difference. Instead of no one caring because of the winner takes all rule.

If the united states was to go to a popularity vote this would push millions of people to get up, out and vote because they know what the are doing is going to make a diffrence. According to Plumer "...over 60% of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now." The fact is that voters cant always control whom their electors vote for. We don't want another 2000 fiasco on our hands again, since electorsÂ  can directly defy the right of the people. Ellectoral collages are unfair, outdated, and irrational due to this fact by it's self.

The Ellectral colleges are non democratic in a way that when you vote for a presidential canidate you're really voting for a slate of electors. That slate of electors could vote directly aginst what you voted for and not lose a minute of sleep over it. According to Posner, "Romney was in the South, has no incentive t campiagn heavily in those states , for he gains no ellectoral votes.... the residance of the regions .. feel as if there votes dont count.. really isnt their president."By this the people meant that since the candiate dosent campaign there they feel as if they are disenfranchised.

For these reasons i think we should go to a Popularity vote for presidancy in the United Sates. I think it would make people feel more appritiated and more people would vote. This would also bring up the votes in total that would be cast.
