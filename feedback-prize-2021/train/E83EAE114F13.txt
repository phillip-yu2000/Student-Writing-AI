Dear Principal,

I support policy 2 and believe that you should allow cell phone usage during free time and lunch at school. It is important to have a cell phone with you at all times. With a cell phone you feel a sense of security that you are safe. I never go anywhere without my phone, so why shouldn't I bring it to school?

After school as a student I may need to walk home or take the bus alone which is dangerous because no one knows exactly where I am but God, they only know where I'm supposed to be. If my father expects me home from school at 6o'clock and I'm not home because my bus was delayed by 10 minutes I could call him instead of having him search every bus stop before my house. Cell phones help us make our lives easier and more convenient.

I know that the as the principal, you must have good reasons for Policy 1 such as it may be stolen. Cell phones do get stolen but you can avoid that by keeping it on you at all times and to take an extra step you could get a tracker on it. Being in a catholic school, we learn about morals and how stealing is a sin. I doubt anyone would have the audacity to go against the commandments and take another student's phone.

Sincerely,

Student
