The Electoral College process involves the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors the votes for VP and the President, and the couting of electoral votes by Congress. In my opinion, I think its only fair to change the election by popular vote for the presdident of the United States. I say that because its OUR president not just the 538 voters president. Also, if we go by the majority of the votes, thats not fair to the president either. what if it just so happened that they picked a lot more people who dont want him to be out president and they just took there verdict from there?

Changing the election by popular vote would be a lot more fair to the presient and to the people. I say that because, you cant tell what every body wants just by 538 votes and with the majority of 270 electoral votes. Like I said before, what if you just so happend to pick a lot more people who dislike the "new" president, but their were actually a lot more people who liked him?

To Conclude, changing te election by popular vote for the president would be a lot more fair instead of having an Electoral College vote. Popular vote will let everyone have a say in the President and not just 538 people. Its also just as fair for the President as it is to us because it gives the president more votes to count on and not just 270.
