Dear Principal,

I understand you think that we should maintain a B average, but it's easier said than done. many students have a hard time with certain things in class that bring their average down. Since most of the students in our school have a C average, it is not likely we will be able to have many teams here. To tell you the truth, i think most of the things the students have trouble with will never turn up in our lives again. Another thing is that all of the teachers grade things differently, so it may throw off the averages by a little bit.

A C average is still a passing grade and i, for one, think that should be the cut-off. If not a C, than at least make it a B- because as well as encouraging my peers to do better, it will also give the school teams it will be proud of. I encourage you to think about these options as a leader and decision maker at our school. We have a lot of students who would like to join sports teams here.

Thank you,
