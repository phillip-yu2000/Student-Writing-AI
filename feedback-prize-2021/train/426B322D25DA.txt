Dear Principal,

You should allow students to have cell phones in school because if we have something after school we need to stay at, our parents may remind us. If we had an after school activity canceled, we could text or call our parents and ask them if we should ride the bus or if they will pick us up from school. We students should be able to have cell phones in school and use them during free times and lunch as long as we don't abuse our privileges and we don't use them during class. If our parents need to pick us up early from school, need to tell us to ride the bus or they are a car rider, our parents can text or call us to tell us that after they tell the front office, that way we'll be ready when they get here or to go to the buses. If we want to go home with a friend on their bus, we could call one of our parents and ask them to call the front office to tell them we're going to ride a different bus.

We should be able to have phones on school but turned off during classes. If we have our phones turned on in class and our parent tries to call us, our ringer may go off. As long as we have the ringers and noises turned off that would be fine as long as we are not texting. If a student drops and breaks their phone, they can't try to sue the school because they weren't being careful or they don't have a case for it.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
