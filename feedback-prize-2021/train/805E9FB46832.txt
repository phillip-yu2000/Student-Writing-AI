Cars of Tomorrow

There is something being bettered everyday, and in this case, it's cars! The cars of the future or also known as the "Driverless Cars" have been on road since 2009 and have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Different methods/techniques have been tested in the direction of the development of future cars, such as cables embedded in tracks that send radio signals to receivers in front of cars, magenets with alternating polarity, the list is never-ending. Although these automobiles have been driving to near perfection, there's always room to improve.

The prompt asked us to give our induvidual point of view on the "Driverless Cars", and in my opinion they're great, but like I said previously, they, just like everything thing else needs improvement. The cars have drove for nearly seven entire years on a perfet track record of zero crashes and that's pretty darn good. The thing about the automobiles is that they're not completely driverless, the cars need a person active while the car's active. That was a brilliant idea i thought, having an active person at the wheel while the car was on the road is so much more safe than to have a person in the backseat (theoretically) while the car is in motion. Adding up all aspects of the car, it's features, and feats, I say its a tremendous step in the technology world and I believe it will thrive in the modern world. There's nothing wrong with trying something new and especially if it has something to do with things people use eveyday.

The "Driverless Cars" will be great in the future and are perfect now, knowing that they've yet to crash or have an accident. Having cars that can drive pretty much by itself is a tremendous step, having those on the road would be a major feat to overcome. The Driverless Cars make the future safer and less expensive.
