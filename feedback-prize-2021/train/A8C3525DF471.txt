Would it be a good idea to use technology such as computers to read students emothinal expressions. Some people would argue that it is not a good idea beacuse what if some students dont want the computer to tell waht ther felling, they would think it was a little weird. I think that it would be a good idea here is why.

I think it would be a good I dead for computers to read students emotional expressions. I think this because say if somebody is falling be hind in class and the computer can tell. The computer could change the chapter or less he or she is confused with so they could understand it better. The student would no longer be confused and could catch up.

Some people would say that what if the computer thinks the kid doesn't under stand the material that he or she is learning. The computer would change the lesson up a little bit so they could understand it better, but in the long run doesn't. In that case the computer would make it harder for that paiticular student to learn the material given to them.

Some stundents would like it because it would help them ina way that makes them understand the lesson or chapter better witch also would help there grade. If I had the chance to use this technology I would.

Sometimes I am a little lost or cunfused and if you dont get that lesson you could fall farther and aferther in the hole. and never catch up. Whith this technology u would nerver fall behind.

With all the infomation we have the technology could ether help out a student or make them fall behind. The information we have concluds that we would still be etter of we the technology. So not so many people are falling behind and getting confused. You would be able to keep up with your class and not get losed. This is what I think about having this technology to read students emotional expressions.
