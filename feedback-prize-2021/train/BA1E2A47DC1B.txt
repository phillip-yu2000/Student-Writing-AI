In my opinion I think it is a good idea that students have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it can help students in thier social aspect, help them become more active, and it can help them learn new things.

Doing things that involves communication can help a student's social aspect. For example, doing different things such as clubs can help students connect to each other and help them to be more open around other people. If a student isn't good at being open, participating in an activity will be good for them. When a student doing somthing active it can be many different things. Sports can also make you more active by it being fun to the students. Students can also be active by helping the community around them such as recycling or donating. In activitys students can learn new things in many different ways. For example, if a student doesn't know what to do in their future, participating in an activity can help them find that. While students are doing things with other students, they can learn from each other to learn new things.

In conclusion it will be good for students to partcipate in a least one extracurricular activity. When students are partipating in different activities it can help them improve different skill sets and help them learn things.Â
