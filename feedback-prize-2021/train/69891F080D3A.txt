Driverless car's isn't safe baceuse there are to may things that can go wrong.

Or someone could get badly injured or even die from a drivless car.

And in the article it also says what car is really the safest." The only safe car has human control at all times."And if there was an accident with one of these car going wrong it would be extremly hard to find who's fault it really is. It also says in the articel that

"If the technology fails and someone getting injured,who is at fault the driver or the manufacture."That is why in most places in the United States baned people from testing these cars."In most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars." So really these cars is a big accident waiting to happen And the only person peopel can blame is the driver for buying the driver less car.

That is why I would not buy or drive one of these cars because there unsafe and dangorious to the public.
