Driverless cars could be the next big thing. I think having driverless cars will be a sight to see. It doesn't seem like a bad idea to me. Of course they will need more work, but this could change the way people drive. Not only in U.S.A., but also the entire world.

For instance , Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. They aren't completely driverless, they send alerts to the driver to take over when things like a road block or an accident occurs. This just means the driver must remain alert at all times while in the vehicle. The driverless car is the same kind of function of an autopilot for a plane. While the driver is waiting for their turn to take over the wheel , it wont give them enough time to text, or use their phone. This can reduce the crash rate around the world.

Imagine how the future will be in 5 to 10 years. The driverless car could be one of the greatest things to happen in the century! All we have to do, is have a little hope. The Google cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. The Google car is still under maintenance. They are continuesly adding more details to it. Like the 3-D model of the car's surroundings. All of us together, can make this the next big thing.
