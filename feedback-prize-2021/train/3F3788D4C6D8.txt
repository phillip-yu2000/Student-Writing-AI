At NASA we found something interesting on Mars, it looked like a face that the Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photos of. Many people believe the Face was an alien artifact, but it was not.

The Face is a natural lanform and was not created by aliens. The captin of NASA at the time said it was a "huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth." The Face wasnt a face it was just the shadowing and placement of where the photo was taken from. "Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared o a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all." This was after more clearer pctures were taken and it looked just like a landform, nothing else.

It wasn't an alien artifact, it was just a landform taken from an angle which it looked like a face and the Viking 1 didn't take that clear of pictures from the ones I have seen and the photos were taken all the way back in 1976.
