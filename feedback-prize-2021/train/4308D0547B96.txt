Hi i am Luke. I have some reasons why I think you should be a Seagoing Cowboy. When i first heard my friend ask me if i wanted to be a Seagoing Cowboy I did not know if I wanted to do it but once i found out what it was i thught it would be fun. When I got there and started doing what i was suppost to do I started enjoying it.

A reason I did is because I knew I was doing the right thing by helping with there community and just helping them with some little things also. Another reason is that when I went their I got to explore the acropolis in Greece and it was beautiful I think you would like it to. I also got a ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. I also went to china! It was very fun and so is being a Seagoing Cowboy. I also learned alot from it like we dont have to worry if we are going to get what we want for breakfast because some people that are less fortunate dont even have Three meals a day. It was hard to take that in but it deffinetly changed my whole point of view in life. I hope that if you give being a Seagoing Cowboy a shot that it would change your point of view in life also.

You should give it a try and see if you like it. If you do not like it you do not have to do it but if you do like it i suggest you do it more often, it is helping out and it is doing the right thing. So my point is that you should give being a Seagoing Cowboy a chance because it could defenitly make a change in this world. Thank you!
