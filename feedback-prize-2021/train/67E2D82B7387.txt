Have you ever wondered why we, American people dont get to choose our electors? I always ask my self that question and never know why. In my opinion i think that the election should be by popular vote by the American citizens. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair to voters and irrational.

The first reason why the electoral college is absurd is because it is not fair. It has a winner- take- all system in each state. Candidates dont spend time in states that have no chance of winning. Into that, the article "

The Indefensible Electoral college

" states "

State legislatures are currently resposible for choosing the electors

". So technically they give us a category of presidents to choose from!

The last the second and final reason is it is irrational. Although the founding fathers of the countries establlished the electoral college, that doesn't mean its still valid. There have been many mistakes and disasters in the previous years. In the same article it says "over sixty percent of the vote would prefer a direct election over the one we have now". This proves that im not the only one who dissagrees on the electoral college.

It makes sense why people will actually like the electoral college. Considering that it is an easier way for us to vote and takes less time. However, a direct election really gives us the freedom that American people deserve. What is the point of voting for a president when you dont have the freedom to vote for the one you want?
