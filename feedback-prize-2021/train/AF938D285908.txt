I am for driverless cars, they seem to be very efficent and have a lot of pros. Driverlress cars might put people off, but they are not that bad. In the future a lot of things will change, espicially cars. They might be different or odd but there is nothing to be afriad of, driverless cars will bring us more good than bad. For example, cars that can drive by themselves efficently, public transport will be more of a breeze. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions that the car will use half the fuel of today's taxis and also provide more flexibility than a bus. This is a great thing.

Some people probably hate the idea of the car. Yes, there are cons to the car but, the car is just now getting started. In the future you can expect the creators to make the car more successful. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. They grow closer to achieveing their goal of an amazing car everyday. Wether the car comes in 2020 or 2075, it will provide a greater future for us.

In a conclusion, I personally am for the driverless car. I think it will be amazing. It will give us a greater and also interesting life. In the future, things are going to change. Some of the changes you might not like but they'll happen anyways. The driverless car is going to be a major part in this change. Hearing about this new car now while all cars are very different, might seem outrageous to people, but the concept of the car is very exciting for our future it is going to provide us great things.
