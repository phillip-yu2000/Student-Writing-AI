Dear Principal,

The first policy would be best because it allows students just enough freedom to keep them satisfied. Students could still participate in the compelling task of using their phones without it interfering with their education. You'll find that no instructional time will be lost if you allow this controlled time for cell phone usage. If you don't let the students to use their phones at all, they will probably be more compelled to use them during class time just to satisfy themselves.

Overall, the first policy has more benefits for you and the students. No time will have to be sacrificed in their school day and you won't have to be on constant patrol during the time you're at work. Also, if there was an emergency at school and the students needed to contact a guardian, it's much more convenient for them to do so. However, with the second policy, there is no way for the students to contact anyone quickly and without hassle. You and your staff will also have to monitor the students constantly making sure all rules are enforced. All of those problems are avoidable if you just enforce policy 1. You can relax and so can the students. Make life easier for everyone and allow them to use their phones outside instructional time.

Sincerely,

Student
