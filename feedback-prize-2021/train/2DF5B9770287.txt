The "Face on Mars" was discovered May 24th, 2001. It was discovered when a spacecraft was cirlcing mars and spotted something that looked like a human face. This is where the name "The Face on Mars" comes from. Some people think it was from aleins, other think it was just a natural land form.

If i were a scientist at NASA and I had to convince them that the " Face on Mars" was not created by aliens i would simply say that there is no evidence that shows aliens where around.

The arictle " Unmasking the Face on Mars" states that on April 5th, 1998 Micheal Milan and his Mars Orbiter Camera team tookphotographs of the object which clearly revealed that the " face " was a natural landform.

Although people werent satified with the therory that the "Face on Mars"is just a natural landform, it is the only conclusion that really makes sense. If aliens made this the spacecraft orbiting mars would have been able to see them. And another thing there would have been signs to prove aliens made this landmark, but there isnt. All of this leads me to believe that the" Face on Mars" isjust a natural landform.
