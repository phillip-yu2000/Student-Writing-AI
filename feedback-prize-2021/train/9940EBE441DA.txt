Electoral College,are you against it or not? I would perfer that we keep this "despised method" for choosing our president.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This is a desierable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful prsident. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes don't count,that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A large state gets more attention form presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is no pressure for the run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.
