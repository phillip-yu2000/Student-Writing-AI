I think that the schools policy for phones is that you should be aloud to use phones during lunch time or when threes free time but not let students use phones during any class time and turn them off. I chose this because using phones in school wont do anything to you or any other students. Unless your using it in class because using phones in class well not let you learn anything and it well distract you from what u r trying to learn.

And if you use your phone in class and texting the person next to u it well take learning out of u and the person your texting. in class.

If you have your phone on in class and someone calls you it well distract you and the people around you trying to learn. That's why students should only use phones during lunch time and free time not during class time.
