Face to face schooling is more beneficial to students then online schooling. having an electronic tell you how to do your work is not the same as a teacher, Online schooling is much easy to cheat on, they may also only have to take classes every few days.

Learning through a screen is so bland with no emphasis. That is why building a bond with your teacher becomes very important throughout a year. Teachers work very hard to supply us with the correct information to succeed. Teachers take lots of well thought out time to plan throughout the year. Each day to them has a purpose, that purpose being teach the students what needs to be known and make sure they are succeeding. Teachers are responsible for the future of our nation.

Cheating in school is punished by bad test scores or even detention. However, online schooling has no way in tracking cheating or punishing cheaters. While sitting at home and taking a test, each student can freely search the web and use other electronic devices to cheat off of. While testing in school you have adult supervision, and everyone has a fair opportunity to succeed. People at home have the unfair advantage of no supervision and online resources.

Some may say that online schools can help kids be stress free, but all in all they are really only stress free because no pressure is being put on them to complete tasking and test by a certain time. Online schools are not beneficial to students in any grade. Without a face to face interaction things will end up being forgotten in days maybe even hours, and there will be no consequences or way of telling if there is cheating online.
