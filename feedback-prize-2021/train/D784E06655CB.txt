As stated in source two, Al Gore won the popular vote when running for president against Bush, but lost the presidency by getting less votes from the electoral college. The American people were given a chance to vote but were overruled by the votes of the electoral college. Saying that, i believe the electoral college should be elliminated and the presidency should be determined by popular vote.

When citizens go to vote for president, they arent really voting for president. They are voting for that canidates electors in the electoral college. Americans should be able to directly vote for who they want to be president. By switching to popular vote only and abolishing electoral college, citizens have more of a say in there own country, rather than eveything going to a slate of electors who have the power to overrule the popular vote.

Although it may have some upsides, such as helping with very close elections, it is regarded as an anachronism. It is non-democratic and i believe it is unfair. The canidate who recieves the most popular vote should be garintied to win.

All in all, in agreement with source two, the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. It would better the voting system if we went to only popular vote and illiminated the electoral college.
