Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I think community service is a great way to show kids how good it is to help out one another and just help the world. For example, when you go to collage if you do community service it can say that on your application, when you just help out a friend who is having trouble in math, and you tutor them and they get a 100...it should feel so good that you helped out someone without being asked or paid for. Also if you have a kid that whines about not having cool clothes or the new phone that just came out and you take them to a homeless shelter to serve soup to full of adults, kids, babies that don't have anything it will show your child how much he/she has and most likely will be grateful for the things they have.

So as you can see community service is such a good thing to do. It will help so many people including you. So if you every have to do community service have fun with it because you will be making a difference to the world and to so many people!
