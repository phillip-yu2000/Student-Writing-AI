Have you ever heard of seagoing cowboys? It is a program of young boys that travel with ships over seas to Europe and deliver animals to countries that are in war. Come help and join the program.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys program then you won't get drafted for the war. I was doing this program and while I was on one of my trips I turned eighteen. I was going to get drafted for the war, but the drafting board heard that I was going on these trips and decided that I was already doing enough for the country and didn't draft me. Another reason to join the program is that you get to see a lot of Europe. I got to see the Acropolis in Greece, I took a Gandala ride in Venice, Italy, an excavated castle in Crete, the Panama Canal, and China. After you deliver the animals, then you get to have a lot more freedom and fun then when they are onboard the ship. There is a lot of open space where the animals were so you can play tabletennis, baseball, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and a lot of other fun games.

You can do all of this and more. Think of how fun it could be if you joined this program. This program helps you for the rest of your life. I am still in contact with the friends I made aboard those ships. Help the country and join the Seagoing Cowboys today!
