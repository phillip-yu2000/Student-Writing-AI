Have you ever went to multiple people for advice? Because if so, you are a genius. Asking advice from multiple people, may seem like a bad idea, but I assure you, it's not. Asking for advice from multiple people is a great idea because of these reasons.

When you ask for multiple peoples advice, you will get rid of biases. If you only ask one person, they may have pre-receivedÂ notions about your situation, and if you try to deal with it yourself, you will have one of the biggest biases, as you're the one who is in the situation. When you ask multiple people, it gets rid of that bias, so that the decision made is not clouded by any personal experiences.

Along with getting rid of biases, it can give a new perspective. Sometimes there are things that you wouldn't think about, and other people can provide that type of view. When you are inside of a situation, it is hard to think outside of the box, especially if it is stressful situation. Without that stress, people can make level headed decisions, and bring a new perspective, which may help.

In addition, asking multiple people may take the weight off your shoulders. If other people can make a good choice, then it will take the weight off your shoulder as you wouldn't have to come up with a solution yourself.

This would help a lot of people, as they would not have to worry about the stress of picking an option.

That is why I think that asking advice from multiple people is a good idea. It gets rid of biases, gives a new perspective, and takes some of the weight off your soldiers. So the next time you are in a dilemma, just ask people for advice.
