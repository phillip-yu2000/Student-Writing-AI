Dear Principal,

I'm writing you a letter involving your decision to let kids play on school sports only if they have a B average. I think that decision is a little unfair to most of the kids have who have a C average. Their for i am against it. You should at least lets kids with C average to play. If you let kids do this, they will still be passing, and still have a opportunity to stay in passing areas.

Some kids try their hardest to keep up their grades but just cant. If you let the kids play with a C average more kids would want to at least try to obtain a C average. Let alone most of the kids have a C average. That way kids with D averages and F averages would try to step it up a little more to make the cut. Some kids give up trying if their goal is set to high. Some kids may think that obtaining a C average is easy, so they try harder to reach the goal or above the goal they are planning to reach. Others think its hard, but they love sports so they push themselves through it.

If you lower the exceptions for sports participants to a C average i guarantee that kids will try harder to achieve. If the students still fail to pass, then boost it up to a B average and make them work really hard to be able to play. Thanks for giving consideration in our opinions!

Sincerely your student,
