Dear principal,

I here find that you have made two policy ideas about bringing cell phones to school. I believe that your first policy to allow students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phone is turned off during class is a great idea. I really don't believe banning cell phones to school is the best solution. It's a great idea to let kids use there phone because just in case if there parents want to talk to there kids.

Kids can also talk to other friends if they can or jus play games on there phone.

It's good to use policy one because kids need there phone. An example of kids using there phone is that they can turn it off during class but use it when it's there free time. Policy two is a bad idea because kids should have there phones just in case of an emergency. For an example if a kid has to contact his parents he can use his cell phone. This why i believe policy one is better than policy two.

Sincerely,

One Of Your Students.
