Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think this is a good idea because a lot of students are getting a C average. If students really want to participate in a sport or other activities, then they will have to try hard to bring their grades up. If they bring their grades up then that would be a good thing and they get to participate in sports or activities. To some students, sports are their life so if they really want it then they have to get the grades. Getting the grades will improve their scores and they get what they want. But some students might go against it. If you just think about it, there's really no point to join a sport with a C average because for one, they won't try at school because what's the point of trying when you already have what you want? And two, they won't worry about anything else except for their sport. Now if you ask me what I think is better, I would say the first one. You get good grade and what you want! The only thing i would ask is; Who wouldn't pick the first one? (:
