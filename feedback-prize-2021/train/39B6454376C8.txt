Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I'm writing this letter to you because i think that is better to not allow students to have cell phones at school at all because they might get distract when they have their cell phones and they might use them during class. I think this is better because some students bring cell phones to school and they use them during class and they don't pay attention to the teacher and they are always distract when they have cell phones, some students don't pay attention because they are using cell phones in class and when the teacher ask them a question they don't know what to answer because they didn't pay attention when the teacher was talking. Another thing is that some students are now getting in trouble because they are using cell phones talking to other people that they don't really know and they give that person information about them and about school and they don't really know who that person is and they could be in danger because that person knows everything about them and about the school.

Sometimes students have their cell phones turn on during class and when the teacher is talking the phone begins to sound like someone calling or a message and they interrupted the teacher and the teacher have to take time from the lesson and tell the student to turn on the cell phone or to give it to her.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME.
