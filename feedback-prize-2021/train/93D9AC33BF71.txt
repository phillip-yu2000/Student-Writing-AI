Dear principal,

I do not think you should make the policy change. If you do this many people will not get to participate in the athletic or any other events. Most people have a C average and i don't think it would be fair to the people who can only do school activities but now since the policy will change they wont be able to participate in any athletic or school event.

You should not change the policy because what if someone did keep getting a C average on their report card, then they would never be able to do a school activity or school sport. I think if you changed this many people would be angry but they probably would try to raise their grades. Many parents would probably try to get their kids to do better in school. This is a positive about changing the policy but i still disagree with changing it.

I think you should not change the policy and leave it at a C average. I think if you do this many students will be happy because they will be able to participate in stuff they would not have been able to do if you had changed it. This is just my opinion and i hope you think about it.

Your Student,
