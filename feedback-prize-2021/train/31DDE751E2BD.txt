If you read the 1st sentence in the 1st paragraph. You can see it said this picture was taking in 1976 then you see a picture from 2001. The 1976 picture is blury so it look like it a face. But in the second picture it more clear and little zoomed up and you can see cracksand mountian/hills in the ground and does not look anything like a human face. Is it ture?

NASA had released the picture to the public. They had made hollywood movies and book and had went on talk show talkiong about the face saying are there really aliens out there . For over good 25 years alot of people thought there really life on red planet. So NASA really wish there was life on Mars so they invented better camreas and ships to send back to Mars see if there was really life on Mars.

In 1998 they had the on borad MGS taken a few pictures and had look like there was pymarids on mars. Cause of the shadows that the landform was making. 41 degrees north and that winter in april for Mars so there alot of clouds. But nasa had prepared took look one last time they said was super hard and alot of work. Because it like fax machine in narrow 2.5km wide strips. they said it just does not pass over face very often.

"Neverthless on april 8, 2001 it was a cloudy summer day on cydonia Mars Global Surveryor drew just enough for second look they" said. In paragrapgh ten they had rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to the center of the face. With camera the maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters pixel from the 1976 vikings photo.

It is a bust the Egyptian-style-pymarids or small shacks. It was a Butte or Mesa landforms. It was shadows or caverns in the landforms. It would of been cool if there ws alien life on there so we copuld learn more about the galaxy. But mabey one day we will find some type of alien artifact out there.
