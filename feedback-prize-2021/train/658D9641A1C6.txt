The end of summer is coming and you're required to complete a project, before going back to school. Some claim that a teacher designed project is more sensible rather than a student designed project,I think a student designed project is better because the teachers provide boring topics,students get the freedom to choose whatever, and let's the students show there creativity.

A student designed project, would be better because teachers provide students with boring topics;If the topics the teachers gave us wasn't boring than students would show more excitement towards the subject as a whole. Such as students don't want to be forced to do a project on something they don't really care about,teachers give out boring topics and expect high tier work from students. Teacher designed project would only be sensible if and only if the student had no idea what to do there project on.

Giving the students an option to design there own projects opens the door for them to show off there creativity. Students rarely get to show there creativity in anything,but if the project was a student based design then the project would be completed at a higher standard compared to a teacher based design. Student based designs would go more in depth with the project giving the audience a true visual on what the student is trying to show compared to a followed rubric that a teacher gave to you.

Last but not least,a student based project shows the teachers your'e capable of using self thinking skills. Showing your'e teacher you know how to use certain skills,such as giving them information on things you need to improve on and things your already good at.

some have claimed that teachers know whats best for the students,but I thought otherwise as the boring topics they give us,not letting us show our creativity and last but not least our self thinking skills.
