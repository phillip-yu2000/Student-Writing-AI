The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea. Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals.

If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family.

Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation.

Having this much pressure can affect students's grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. Students will start getting bad grades.

So, after this many reasons we all know that getting involved in the extracurricular activities can really hurt students. Joining these activities is neither healthy nor good for grades. All this shows that students should choose to be in the activities if they want to not that they are forced to.
