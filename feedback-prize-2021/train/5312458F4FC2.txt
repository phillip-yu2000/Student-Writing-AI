I think electoral college is a terrible idea. I will be giving some of the reasons why i think this "process" is a horrible thing to do. By the end of my essay i hope you will agree with me that electoral college is a waste of time.

Electoral college is a "non-domocratic" way for electing a new president. I personally think that we should count peoples votes and not decide by the majority of the state. I say this because its unfair to the people who voted for the President that didnt get elected because the majority of the state voted for the other president.

Although if most of the state voted for a President that President is guaranteed that he got most of the peoples votes. Another thing that's unfair is that California has more electoral votes than Texas however, there is a chance that Texas is more populated than California. So if the votes were counted by person instead of state there would be a better chance of the President you voted for win the election.

So these are just a few of the reasons why I think electoral college is basically just a huge waste of time and why its unfair to the states with a lower number of electoral votes. Hopefully they will start to count votes in a regular way instead of giving each state a certain number of electoral votes.
