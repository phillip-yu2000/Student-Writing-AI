There is absolutely no way that the "face" on Mars was made by aliens. Some people and very few scientists think this landform was made by aliens on Mars. When you think about it,it is not logical. If there were aliens on Mars scientists and NASA would of known about them by now and would of informed us. They have up to date technology now and would of detected a living thing on Mars if there was anything there,which there isn't.

Some people say that NASA and scientists are trying to keep the aliens a secret and keep them from us but there is no reason to. I think if there were aliens on Mars they would of let us know because it would be a bigger benefit for them because people would want to see them and pictures of them. They could get a lot of money so it doesn't make sense for them to hide them from us. Also the "face" became a priority to them and they took many photos and did a lot of research about it. The most logical answer is that the "face" is just a natural landform or rock formation made by nature. The eyes,nose,and mouth are formed by clouds that give an illusion."What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,lanforms common around the American West,". It is a coincidence that is resembles a face but that doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

There is no reason for people not to believe scientists or NASA because there is no evdience that the "face" was made by aliens or that NASA and the scientists are lying to us. Everything about it is not logical and does not make sense,if there were any actual life on Mars we would of know by now. It is just a rock formation and shadows that is tricking the human eye.
