"The Face of Mars" true or not? "The Face of Mars" is no face at all. Even though with the low resoution, it looks like an Egyptian pharaoh, it just rocks and lava. There are so many reason why its not. Just read on and you will find out why I think this way.

"The Face of Mars", all it is is a martian mesa. these are very common around cydonia. All that this one had was a weird shadowing effect. Our eyes can change to what we know son that is make sense, that why everyone saw a face we also put what we know to something we have no clue on if it help explain it.

The face is just a normal landform. This "Face of Mars" is just like landforms on earth. Some may just look like common things we see everyday. you can't just assume that since it look like someone made that it couldn't be is an natural made landform.

The picture of "The Face of Mars" everyone says looks like a face is such a low resoution it's only 43 meters per pixel. The more resent picture is 1.56 meters per pixel. With the 1.56 meters per pixel you can see more of what's on the surface compared to the 43 meters per pixel.

From the low resoultion to it just a normal landform. From the fact that it looks like other landforms when in a better picture to there's not enough information for it being a alien made object. Theres so many reasons why this not anything more.
