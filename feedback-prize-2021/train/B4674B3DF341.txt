As a driver I feel that transportation is very important when getting to your destination, and feel that it can be improved.

But I also feel that the "driverless car" is not the way to do it.

For one the driverless car is not even driverless, you still need a driver and it questions the safety of the driver and those in the car.

First of all the car still requires a driver, which if we are talking about a driverless car, is useless.

The text states that the car will notify the driver, when to shift gears and take over the navigating, when driving through work zones and around accidents.

By doing so it is not an actual driverless car if it still has to notify the driver to switch gears, to drive.

This also leads to my second point, which questions the driver's safety.

It is said that the car will notify the driver when to drive, with a vibration that is being given off by his or her seat.

Therefore not knowing or feeling the vibration, to alert the driver the are going to switch gears to drive the car, can lead to a major car accident.

That being said it is not the best idea to carry out this experiment involving the driverless car, since it is not actually a driverless car and questions the safety of the people in the car.
