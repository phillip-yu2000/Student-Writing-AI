The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has good and essential uses. The FACS could be used to identify what emotion the painting or drawing has. For example, the "Mona Lisa" painting could be a great example of why to use this system. I believe that the use of this technology to read the emotional exressions of students in a classroom could be valuable. In a way, the students can be learning at a way where the lesson will have their attetntion if it is interesting to them.

I agree that the FACS could help in a classroom with students and maybe even improve their way of learning. If the computer could see what facial expression the student has, the computer realizes the student gets bored then it might boost itself so that the lesson can becomoe interesting to the child. As I read the text called "Making Mona Lisa Smile" I understood the point the author was making. "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored", Dr. Huang predicts. I highly think there would be a change in the academic learning environment. According to the passage, "Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication", meaning that the computers would also have to understand what the feeling is without actually communicating with the person.

Overall, I do agree with using the FACS in a classroom with students in a classroom to help the students and the learning environment. The computer system would read and determine what the emotion is by detecting how the muscles are behaving. Meaning that if most of the muscles are at rest, then the emotion would most likely be a resting face. If the professors are right abot their prediction, then we would see somewhat of a change.
