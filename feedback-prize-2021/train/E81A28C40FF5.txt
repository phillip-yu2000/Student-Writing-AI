Dear Principle

I believe that "policy 2" is not such a good idea because students will bring their phones to school no matter what and will disobey your idea of not bringing their cell phones. Policy 1 in my opinion is a great idea because student will b allowed to talk to there friends or call home in case of an emergency they have. When students walk into class they should place their phones in a bucket so they wont b able to use them or have the teacher make sure their phones or turned off and put of way.

The cell phone policy in schools are one of the most biggest concerns to teachers because mostly in every class there is always a student guy or girl using their cell phone to communicate with their friends to talk. this is why letting students use their cell phones during there free time in school is a good idea so they can have time to talk and text to their friends and talk what they want to talk about so they can pay attention during class instead of texting their friends during class to talk and instead pay attention.

All though policy 2 isn't such a good idea but it will teach the students to not text during school. School is to learn not to socialize only on their personal time they can. students become less smarter because they are distracted by using their cell phone to talk during school and that's how they never learn. students need to learn that there is more to life then just texting and talking on their cell phones.
