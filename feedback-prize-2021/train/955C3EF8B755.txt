Do you know who the Seagoing Cowboys are and what they do? I will be stating reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys and an explanation of what you would do. This job could be or could not be the program for you.

I think that people should join this because of internatinal travel to help people across the globe. Also if you are a Farmer this job would be perfect because you would know exactly what to do with the animals that are being taken to another country to help the people that had lost a lot to the World War 2. This program could teach you what to do if you would want to be a Farmer.

The cattle-boat trip is an unbelieavable opportunity for a small town boy.

This job can be dangeris because a crew member almost when over board injering his ribs. This job can also be fun because you get to play games in the livestock stalls and tour different cityies.

In councludion this program can be a mix of fun and dangeris to people.

"It made me aware of people and other countries needs" What do you think life as a Seagoing Cowboy was like?
