Dear Principle,

Hello! I was wondering if you have made your decision on the community service projects. I think as a student I would not want to do the project but, as a person who is getting help from the students I would want the help from the students. As a student I think it would be a great opportunity to help people in need because some day you never know if you will need help. So if you are not going to require that students to do community service than you have made your decision and I can not change that. if you require community service than thank you. You have just helped a person in the community that needed help. One time when I was doing community service, one of the people that i was helping came up to me and thanked me for what i was doing and she said that i would be greatly rewarded someday. i think that you should require community service because not all people have the same things as us and they need to learn that life can be very hard. I want people to experience what it feels like to help someone in need. I know some people that already do community service and they love it they say that it is a good thing to do and they enjoy helping people in need. But other students want to sit around and be lazy and you don't want sluggish students do you, I don't.

Your Student,
