A self driving car? Are people really that lazy? Ha! Well duh! I sure know I. It would be awesome to have a self driving car. I could text while Im driving, I could get on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and so much more! If they have what they say there going to have uou could possibly just watch whatever you want to watch.

Now there are some down sides to this and list them all shortly but were are going to start with the possitve things first.

Ok the car can drive its self thats a plus in its self. Like I said you can be in the car on your phone and not have to worry about crashing 90% of the time anyways. Think of all the new features that will have have to go into your car. The window display the intertainment features. The GPS and satlite that'll be in your car. Those are my positives!

There are some negatives though! I mean the car can drive its self theres negatives in that its self. What if you get bored and fall alseep you might wrec and or hold up traffic. The senors may mess up and cause an accident. Then whos fault would that be?

Well those are my points!
