Not every student has the time for extracurricular activity classes. If the principle dose decides to have students do extracurricular activity classes then it should not be counted as a grade. I think this because most students have other classes, grades, and homework to worry about. If the principal require a extracurricular activity classes then students might become stressed.

First, students already have a choice in which related art class they want to take. Even though it is a choice it is still marked as a grade. Related art classes is like a break from class. If the principal requires you extracurricular activity classes then thats taking time from students learning.

Second, feel like students would not have enough learning time in school if extracurricular activity classes gets added to our school hours. Then it might be too much pressure on students and that can effects a students learning. Teachers need time to teach and students need the time to process what they are learning. Some students need more class time to do work therefore extracurricular activity classes might not be the best choice.

Lastly, some students might not be interested in taking extracurricular activity classes. Students might not be interested because they might not have the time for it. Most students will not try in something they are not interested in and some students are not interested. If teachers count this class as a grade then grades might go down because how many classes is taken in a day.

In conclusion, I think all students should have a choice to take extracurricular activityclasses. Not all students have the time or interest to take the class. Will you make your students take this class if you were a principle.
