The article " Making Mona Lisa Smile", In the text it describes how new techonology called the Facial Action Coding System can enable to identify human emotions and it's not rignt that people can use a machine to know if your happy,sad, or angry at someone that the person personnal feelings and people have no right to know what thier feeling about something.

In a lot of ways I disagree on this new facial coding because it's not others people' s businesse to know how other's feel about what their doing. I am sure others would feel unconfertable knwoing that other people around know how you feel all the time. Somethimes when you feel alone or sadness and you don't want others to know because your not ready to tell them what's been going on and because of the Facial Action Coding System people would feel like they don't have their own personal space to think about themselfs and knowing how they feel about something.

In some ideas I agree with the article is when in the article it said "A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored" I agree on that statement; to use this new technology for educational purposes as long as no student or teacher abusses it to know what are others feeling about you or something else. It also a good idea to use it when someoone is really depressed about something and if you feel something is gonna happen to the person and you can tell an adult to help with the problem. Is not right for someone else to know your feelings, people have no right to know what someone else is feeling because people can take advangen of someones feelings and use it agaisnt them and can hurt someone for ever and maybe it can affect someone's life in the future.

At the end people still have no business to mess or know how someone feels becuase that's the other person personal feeling but at some point the Facial Action Coding System can be useful in school because it can detect if someone is confused or having trouble understanding the assignment or chapter their going through. The article " Making Mona Lisa Smile " has a lot bad points but in some statements they were right.
