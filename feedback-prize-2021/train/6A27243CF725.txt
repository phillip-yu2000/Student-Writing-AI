the policy should be that students should not bring phones to school because that get them out of the way of doing their work in school and that ,that's the only thing that's going to be on their mind they waiting on to get a text or a picture sent to there phone then it rings during class and sometimes they don't get caught doing it but then they do like yesterday my friend phone was ringing in reading class in that the principal just got through talking to him but at the end of the day he got it back but its not always going to be like that i say if it ring in class and they get it token from them then wait for there parents to come and get it from the school that's what should happen to the kid that bring it to school but sometimes it don't happen like that they should put it on vibrate so that they can not here the phone ringing in class but i think that the policy should or shouldn't have phones in school because what is some thing happen then you have a reason to have you phone
