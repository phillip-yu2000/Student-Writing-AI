I am a student who attends SCHOOL_NAME. In this article I am going to explain to you about why our principal should consider the policy that allows students in our school to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free time, as long as phones are turned off during class time. I think that we should be able to have phones in school for our free time. We barely get enough time in school for anything as it is. We get up in the morning, go to school, and attend class periods all day for 8 hours strait and then end up going home with homework in your hands. Then we get up the next morning and do as we did the day before all over again. How much does a school expect one student to handle. i don't think the principal should even have a right to allow the policy that does not allow students to use cell phones in school at all. I know that education is very important and that students should do as well as we can and get good grades. But having the right to use a cell phone during lunch period or any other free time would not affect that at all. The principal should definitely consider the policy that allows students to bring cell phones to school and use them during lunch period and any other free time, as long as they are turned off during class.
