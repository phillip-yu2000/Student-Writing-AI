Okay so First, I think student should take 1 class in home like online Secound, Because if you need more credit you should take it Third, You can go too a summer schools.

finally, Student are going to be more confidence because they are going to be at home doing the online class and no body is going to interrut then because, they are alone working on the class, So if i was me a will shose the online class, Some student prefer to go to schools classes because they can hang out with friends, Some day in class at schools the teacher do group so the student can work together, Other way to get class credit is to go to summer schools for two week, So it woud benefit to students to go to schools normal and then, When schools end students should take the online class, I think they can do both the online classes and the summer class, So they get more credit faster and they graduate more faster.
