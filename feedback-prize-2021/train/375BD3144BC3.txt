Uuugh! Have you ever been forced to do an activity? Considering that i'm a student I know I have. Many kids don't do extracurricular activities because of technology. I dont blame the principal making students have to participate in these kind of stuff, it's healthy, but I disagree because it's too much stress, have things to do, school didn't have what some of us wanted.

First, students don't do or play sports because of stress. This can be caused by having to be on time when it is hard to. Parents don't have time to take their son or daughter to practice due to their job, and when they arrive late the couch will be mad. Some don't finish their homework so it keeps piling up having to stay after with teachers to finish. Others have personal problems with family or friends, and are struggling to keep things together.

Second, we have things to do. For example the parent is at work or the sibling can be sick and have to be cared of. Another is that 14+ year old have jobs after school and don't have the time to do the things they like. Even some can't stay after at all for the fact that they did something troublesome like vandalism, and now are on house arrest, but can still go to school to learn.

Finally, The school didn't have what we wanted for a choice. Like skateboarding. Schools hate skateboarders, but as a after school choice like this kids with boards can practice some tricks and ride around a certain space. Video games can be healthy like Wii Sports. Wii Sports has a variety of games the kids can choose from and even go against each other. There are so many choices we students want to add, and I think it would be wonderful for principals to listen to these great ideas.

In conclusion, I disagreed because it is too much stress for us, have other things to do, didn't have a subject some of us wanted. So principals please give us a choice of yes or no. We hate being forced into things we clearly don't want to do.
