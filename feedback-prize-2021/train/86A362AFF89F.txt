I don't think students should have to do community service to me that's something you have to do want to do. I wouldn't want to do it community service sounds boring and a waste of my time. People that love Earth day and people who actually care about the world and want to waste their times cause they have no life they would want to do that. To me that sounds unfair for the principal to do that to us cause forcing us to do it is like going to court and the judge telling us that we have to do 40 hours of community service. If the principal does make us do that i will have a petition and a protest against it i will be standing up for the people that don't want to do community service. Well That's my opinion i hope you make the right decision thank you for listening. :)

THE END.
