Today in the actuality is easier to take classes or courses, online or video conference, because the system of education is always trying to improve them self as everything in the world. The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier.

My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home.

This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion:

Do not have to spend gas going to school.

Do not spend in different clothes everyday.

The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower.

We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work.

The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher.

This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that don't let you go to school.
