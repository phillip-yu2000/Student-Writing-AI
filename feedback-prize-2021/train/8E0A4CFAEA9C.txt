Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I strongly believe that students should not be allowed to have their cell phones out during school hours. Students will be able to focus better, students won't be late to class, and students will not distract others.

To start off, students should not be able to have cell phones out during school hours so they can focus better. If a student is on their cell phone during class they will not be learning anything and will most likely fail. Education is very important because if you are well educated you can get a scholarship into college and have a wonderful career. But if you are not well educated you will not get any of those things and you will most likely end up getting paid minimum wage.

Furthermore, students should not be allowed to have cell phones out during school hours so they won't be late to class. If a student is tardy twice to class they will receive a detention and the next tardy after that will be a referral. Those will affect your discipline record and won't get you into college either. At school, cell phone use is just not necessary and shouldn't be tolerated at all. Also, if your are late you will have missed the class instruction and as well as some academic material needed to pass that class.

Last, students should not be allowed to have cell phones out during school hours because it can distract other students from their work. I remember this time when my class was taking an important test and one of my classmates cell phone rang and that student got a zero on that test. If a students phone rings during class another student could be distracted and waste time off of that assignment and also lose credit because the work was incomplete.

To sum it all up,

I strongly believe that a student should not be allowed to have a cell phone out during school hours so students could focus better, they will not be late to class, and they will not distract others.
