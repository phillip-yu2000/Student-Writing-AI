Venus is one of the two closest planets to earth. Scientists would very much like to travel to Venus and even poissibly take samples from there, but there are a lot of dangers. Despite all the dangers Venus is still very much like Earth, and even though Venus would be very challenging to travel to it is still very much possible.

Venus was most likely the planet to be very much like Earth a very long time ago, but even today Venus has some features that are the same as Earth's. For example, in paragraph 4, the text states,"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment an includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters." Venus may not completely be like Earth, but it has vey similar features. Scientist already know about some of these features, but there are probably a lot more similarities between the two planets.

Traveling to Venus would be very challenging and even possibly life risking, but scientists are sure there is a way. NASA's idea is to hover over the fray with a blimp like vehicle, but there are still risks. In paragraph 5, the author says," At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth." The temperature in the blimp like vehicle would still be very uncomfortable for the passenegers, but the last sentence in paragraph 5 says, " Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"

Traveling to Venus would be an amazing thing for the people in NASA. There are many different risks, but so much would come ouf of traveling there. Having risks should not stop scientist from being able to experiment with different planets, especially one so close to home. As it says at the end of paragraph 8,"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
