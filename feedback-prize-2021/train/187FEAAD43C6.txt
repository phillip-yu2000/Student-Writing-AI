In "The Challenge of Exploring Venus" the authors suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit the danger it presents, the authors supports their idea by pointing out the many good things that could stem from the exporation of Venus. One of the way he supports his idea stated in the passage is in Paragraph 8 where he states,"Striving to meet the challenge persented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevours."

I personally think that the author says this with the meaning that, even if we don't get anything besides just the completion of the task, we as a species got the invaluable experince of knowing what to do when faced with a chance for challenge and the potential future exploration of a similiar nature. Another example is in Paragraph 2 where the author says,"Often referred to as Earth's "twin," Venus is the closest plant to Earth inn terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too." This statment by the authors supports his main idea directly by helping the case of whether we as a species should explore Venus, as it gives motive to broaden our horizons and take a chance, regarless of the dangers and uncertainty.
