Do I think drivers should be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Although this topic is an on-going debate I do not believe that drivers should be able to use their cellular devices to a certain extent whie driving. What I mean by this statement is that drivers should be able to use their phones if a gps is needed, however only with a phone holder in the car. Also, people should be able to make urgent calls here is three reasons why i think people shouldnt be able to use their cellphones because you can cause traffic collision. Also, it puts not only the driver in danger but other drivers also. Its also ilegal to be on the phone while your driving. The government made a new law the hands free law.

The hands free law is a new law in the united states the hand free law is all drivers operating a moving vehicle on any highway of the state are prohibited from holding an electronic device while driving. Also, NO TEXTED WHILE DRIVING! Another one is no watching videos, movies and etc while driving. If you break a law their are always fines that you would have to pay so if its your first time breaking the hands-free law the fine is $50.00 the second time you break this law the fine will be $100.00. You are not allowed to us your cell phone while driving but you can use your phone if you stop the car not at a stop sign but like if your stop to park somewhere then you can get on your cellphone. I feel like if you need to used your cellphone like for an emergency you should go to the nearest parking lot and then do what you got to do.
