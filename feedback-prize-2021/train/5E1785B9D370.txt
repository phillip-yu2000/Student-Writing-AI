"The more technology we have the more knowledge we loose. The more technology we have the more lazy we get." Cars could fundamentaly change the world. In the article "Driverless Cars Are Coming," the author presents both postive and negative aspects of driveless cars. Driverless cars have a more negative aspect than a positive aspect because it can cause many accidents, they're expensive and they are too smart.

Driverless cars are faster than any other car ,a lot of people are facinated with them but the fact that these cars can steer, accelerate and brake themselves can cause many accidents. These driveless cars dont drive through work zones and around accidents. The car will require the human's attention whenever there's a problem. if the techonology fails whose fault is it? the drive or the manufacturer?

One of the biggest concerns about driveless cars is that they're really expensive baecause they have many expensive sensors;sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camara mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors and a GPS. imagine how much all of these things could cost? very expensive and what if one day you wake up and the car doesnt work? imagine how expesive it is going to be to fix it.

Lastly, Driveless cars are too smart. They have a very advanced technology. They have all thse sensors and too much technology can be very dangerous for humans, tis technology is not nessesary for hiumans.

in Conclusion, Driveless cars can be very dangerous but a a lot people would love to buy them just for the simply fact that it can be more practical, that way the dont have to drive to store if they dont want to or to their jobs or even to another state. There is only four states that have approved the use of this cars. Manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars proved more reliably safe.
