Hi I'am Luke Bomberger, and way back in 1945 (WW2) my friend ,Don Reist, asked me if I wanted to become a seagoing cowboy and join the UNRRA.( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), the UNRRA is a group of people that resupplied things people had lost after WW2 like food and animals. You might not think it was fun but, boy are you wrong. I had a ton of fun like playing sports and site seeing, and you would too, if you became a seagoing cowboy.

We got to play games after we droped of the animals, there was a ton of room to play many of my favorite games with some of my friends I meet aboard the boat. We played baseball, vollyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, whittling ,and sometimes read. The activites helped pass time in between loads.

Since we traveld in diffrent parts of diffrent contries we could see many site seeing tourist spots. Acropolis, the excavated castle ,many diffrent oceans ,and parts of beauitful contries. We also went on a gondola ride which I thought was weird because we were most of the time on a boat.

Knowing I am helping make a diffrence in many peoples lives was probably the best part of it all. You may see being a seagoing cowboy as loading and unloading boats full of animals, but I am rebuilding contries and lives of many people. Becoming a seagoing cowboy has changed my whole life in an amazing way. Become a seagoing cowboy and understand why I say that.
