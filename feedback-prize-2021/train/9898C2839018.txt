Dear Principle,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME. I have heard about your change to make athletes have a B grade average to play. I must say I am very pleased to hear that. Most athletes are more worried about the next game or when practice is, and they are not focused on there school work. I am all for this change.

Most teenagers don't realize how important school is. They need to realize that most of them will not play professionally and should focus on their school work to insure they get a good job and have a nice life. Most athletes think that they are good enough to make it to the professional level, but most have other things happen. Middle school athletes should focus more on school work and not worry about sports so much.

Now I think that doing sports and after school programs is fun and I encourage it, but if it gets to the point to were they are fighting teachers to not give them homework because of the big game or the rehearsal then that has taken it to far and they should start focusing more on school work. School work should be done first and foremost. There should be an athlete or actor or whatever they do participating with a D or C average the should be in a classroom doing extra credit work.

Personally, most of the blame can fall on the coaches or leaders of a group. Students should be able to do their homework right after school and not have to go straight to practice. Why is there practice right after school most parents don't let there child do anything until their homework is done. Another option, there could also be a study hall for the students that have lower then a B grade average to work on there school work when they should be practicing.

Thank you for reading this letter and please take some of the consecrations into perspective.

Sincerely

STUDENT_NAME
