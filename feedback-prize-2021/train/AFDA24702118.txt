A lot of students do extracurricular activities if they are interested in them. Such as doing a sport or working on a year book. They are there for students to enjoy. So shouldn't we have a choice to join or not?

We shouldn't have to do extracurricular activities if we don't want to. What if your life is busy and you don't have time. A lot of students are already stressed about their regular classes and they are required to do an activity over top of everything?

I strongly disagree with students having to do an extracurricular activity. We shouldn't have to do something we are not interested in. All you should have to do at school is learn. A bunch of students could easily get stressed out from everything. I get easily stressed and I get a lot of homework. My life is really busy and being required to do an activity I am not interested in, can ruin my day.

Extracurricular activities are there for students to enjoy them and feel like they are apart of something. If we don't like the activity though, some problems might appear. With a tight schedule, doing an activity can leave student with no extra time. Students can go exhausted and come to school very tired. There would be too much to think about and students wouldn't be very happy in those classes/ activities.

We shouldn't have to do something if we don't want to. It would be annoying and tiring. We need to be able to have a choice to do them or not. Everyone have a different things they like to do. So yes, we should have a choice to do them or not.
