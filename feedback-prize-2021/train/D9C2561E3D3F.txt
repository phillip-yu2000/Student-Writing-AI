Dear, Principal

I have been hearing about all this commotion with this community service stuff. I feel like i should have my say in this part so i' m going to tell you what i think about the community service. I think we should have students take part in community service.

The first reason i think we should participate in community service is that it sets a good example for people. By doing this i feel like we could persuade other schools to take part in this experience. And possibly make this a worldwide thing to do in this country. That's my first reason why i think we should take part in community service.

Responsibility. That is what this would teach us students. It would help them understand the work world. Also how to care for others or helping around the town with certain things. That is what this community service thing would do for us.

My last reason i think we should do this is this would be an on going thing in the school. It would keep going on 20 years later 30 years 50 years 100 hundred years. It would be an on going thing which would be setting examples and helping out around the town for years to come. I would teach our kids to do this and our kids kids to do the right thing and participate in this community service project. That is my last reason for this.

I hope i have persuaded you enough to take action in this. Cause responsibility is a big part of peoples lives and i think this would be just the right thing to do for us children. So i support taking part in community service.

Sincerely your student, STUDENT_NAME
