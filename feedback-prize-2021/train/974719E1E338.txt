Have you ever heard about the face on Mars? Well I have, let me tell you that it freaks me out. Do you think that the face is actually a face?

A few days after NASA sent Viking 1 to Mars to take pictures, they got back photos of a face. Not just any face, it was a human face. Not only is this crazy, it's impossible. It's impossible because we spent a lot of time and money reaserching if humans can go live on Mars. And it has been scientifcally proven by us that no human can live on Mars, so for that reason I don't know how that human face got there in the first place.

I know that some people think that maybe aliens are the ones who made the face, and you may be right. In some cases though, while we we'er reaserching, we would have noticed already. What we think it is is a natural landform. I know that it sounds crazy, but it is a possibility. It would make more sense if it was a natural landform.

If you can't decide if it's a face, aliens, or just a natural landform, then let me take some details from the article to support my idea. One detail is that when scientists found out about the figure, they knew that it was just another Martian mesa. They are common enough around Cydonia. When the pictures were released, it revealed a natural landform. It turns out that there was no alien monument after all.

Dou you believe me know? All of theses details add up to only one solution, which is that it was only a natural landform. I couldn't make this decision without proof, and now that I got it, I can prove to the world that there is nothing but a landform.
