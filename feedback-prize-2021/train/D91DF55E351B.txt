Dear principal

I

think you should change policy for sports because more students should try there best to get good grades in there class because there trying to stay on what every team there on. Many students on a team get better grades in there class and some students who don't try getting better grades in what ever class there in get kicked off the team because grades come first in school not the team

If you made the policy for school sports get a B or A to stay on your team the schools over all GPA would be much higher because more student would try getting a good grade in what ever class there in. that a good thing for the class and school over all to. If the kids who get bad grades get kicked off the team would try their best next year because they see what they must do to stay on the team.

Fact more of the population try and work harder if there something on the line.

when your on a team theirs some much you can lose if you get kicked off. you can lose your friends, some of your team mates respect because you weren't trying your hardies to stay on the team.

you wouldn't want to lose your buddies over something like no trying in school and only thinking about the sport and not your grades. With ever action theirs a reaction so if you try doing your best on your team you might wanted to try your best getting good grades in school.
