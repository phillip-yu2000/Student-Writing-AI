I think if a student has a C average he or she may not be able to participate in sports or in other activities is not much of good idea because I know that in this school out hundreds of students there might only be like from ten to twenty students that has nothing but A' s and B' s in their report card.

So imagine you do change the policy so that students may be able to participate in sports or other activities there will only be like twenty or maybe less students going to those activities for example me I never gotten only A' s and B' s in my report card I always get like only one A three B' s and the rest C' s but I never gotten an F or D or else my parents take all my privileges like my xbox the TV or the computer.

There was this on time when I got an F in my report card I got an F on math class I didn't wanted to show the report card to my parents but eventually they found out when I got home my dad asked me " where's the report card?" and I said the teacher hasn't give us the report card he said your lying because the school called me and told me they gave you the report card
