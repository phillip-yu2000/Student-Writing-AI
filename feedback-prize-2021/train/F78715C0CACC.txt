"People are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders," said Enrigue Riera in excerpt 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Limiting car usuage is opening doors to breathing in fresh air rather than filling it with toxins from thousands driving everyday. A day without a car can and will have beneficial implacations for the enviroment along with carbon emissions. Excessive amounts of space is taken up of nothing but parking spaces.
