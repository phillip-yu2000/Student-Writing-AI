Dear Principal,

I heard about the two new cell phone policies that you are thinking about considering. I think that the first policy of letting the students use their cell phones at lunch and at other free times is a great idea. It gives students a chance during a certain time of the day to interact with other people. In the first policy it also states that the phones must be turned off during class.

Right now, we are aloud to bring our phones to school and they must stay in our locker, as far as I'm concerned. I don't see a reason why students aren't aloud to use them if we are at lunch or not doing anything at all during school. It may be a distraction to some people while doing work, so I can see why they aren't aloud in a way. I

think you should really think about considering the first policy. I

and I think many more students as well, believe that it is a great idea. Please just keep my words in your mind and think about it.

It could really change things. Thank you.

Sincerely,
