Dear principal,

imagine being the best basket ball or football player in the school but you couldn't play because you have a just be low the standard grade. I say no because there are really good that would just ruin peoples athletic ability . what if there was a really good basketball player .an his only way to go to collage was to collage was to get a scholarship . but they couldn't because he didn't have a good enough grade. how would it make him feel knowing he's a good player an not being able to go to collage , i think the you move the requirements up one more grade.

Say this kid only has a C and the football seasons start a n his sport was football. an he tried to do everything he could to move his grade up to a B but it still didn't budge? then to top that say he only had a C in one class and the class was really hard. but the teacher still only gave him a C . and he would miss out on football season because of one class he had a C in.

Then he has problems at home an he just gets stressed out an cant consternate. then he would just want to take his stress/anger out in football, but he couldn't cause his grade in the ONE class wasn't good enough! then his parents are fighting and he cant work cause there always in each others ear. so he walks around school with nothing to take it out on . but if he had that one grade up he could depend on sports .

So this kid walks around school an he trys every thing to bring that grade up he does exta credit an he also stays after class to get help. an nothings working soo he gets into fight cause he feels that's the on;y way to take
