Dear Principle,

I think that making students have at least a B in a class is a bad policy. It will make students less likely to try out for sports and some students need sports to be able to stay in shape. Also some students will do better in school if they have a sport to play to clear their mind after a long day at school. For others it is something fun to do to get their mind off of the C and to put it behind them. Sports can also be a social thing and a C should not be able to take that away unless it is a parents decision.

It can also be a good thing. It could get students to work harder at a grade to get to play a sport. It could get some students to help others out if they need them on the team so it would help both sides. It could even get coaches to get talking to kids about keeping good grades so they can keep playing sports.

With everything I know i could say all in all it would probably turn out to be a bad policy in the end. Many students just won't care enough and eventually there will be no sport teams at all. Some parents may get involved and argue about it and possibly take their kid out of the school system. Below a C would probably work out better and would make everybody a lot happier. There will probably not be parental involvement and even students will like to be able to get one bad grade and still be able to play sports. If you compromise everybody will be happier and school and grades will be much more enjoyable.
