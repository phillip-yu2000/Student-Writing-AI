The thought of having driverless cars being introduced in the near future is for one, scary and exciting. There are two ways that you can come about the driverless cars, you can enjoy and agree with the idea or you can disagree.

Google has been working on this project since 2009, they have built cars that can drive more than half a million miles without crashing. The cars arent's 100% percent driverless. Yes, the cars will be able to drive for you, but only for a certain amount of time. People think that since they're driving driverless cars, that they can text, be on their phones, or do whatever while in the car. The cars cannot deal to drive around roadwork or accidents, drive in traffic issues, or pull in and out of driveways. That's when you have to take control of the car, and drive yourself. So, the drivers have to be alert and ready to take the wheel when the time comes. GM has came up with the idea that the driver's seat will vibrate when the vehicle is in danger and needs assistant. Google's vehicles announce the driver when the driver should prepare to take over the wheel. They are improving more and more each day. Telsa has a project in 2016 that releases cars to be able to be on autopilot 90 percent of the time. "Mercedes-Benz,Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."

I am not against the idea of having driverless cars. I honestly think it would be a great idea. Airplanes have autopilot, why can't vehicles also. Drivers also have to be real responsible while in driverless cars, they need to keep their eyes on the road at all time and hands on the wheels. So when the vehicle needs assissting, the driver can assist.
