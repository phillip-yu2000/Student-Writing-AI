Life on another planet is something that is very hard to find scientific evidence for.

In the science world you always have to have many sources to prove something is real.

There were always claims that the Face resembling landform was made by alien people but where is the proof?

I am about to tell you how there is no reasonable explanation for the mesa on Mars being created by aliens.

First, I will tell you a little bit about me.

I am a scienctist and I worked for NASA when Viking 1 journeyed through space. Over the years, as more advanced photography have taken pictures of the mesa, it has led me to believe that the formation is not an alien artifact.

Also, the mount on Mars looks just like the "Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho".

Which makes me think it was just a coincidence that it looks like a face.

Next,

the image from Mars Global surveyor in 1998 does not resemble a face to me at all.

The Viking 1 photo probably had bad shadows.

The face was "formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth".

Further, the landform resmebles mountains and hills on earth; and other planets have mountains and hills too.

Moving forward, people think NASA is hiding something, but in reality finding other forms of life would benefit many studies and researchers.

"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."

Finally, how come there is no other evidence of life on Mars?

Don't you think that aliens would have made other landforms?

In conclusion, life on other planets is very hard to prove.

We have many explanations for why the Face is a "huge rock formation...which resmebles a human head.".

I hope in future years scientists find more proof leading towards that fact that the Face is a natural landform.
