People ask for advice from others all the time. Sometimes people go to one person for advice, and at others they go to multiple people for advice. For a couple of different reasons, in order to make the best choice it is better to ask several people for advice rather than just one person.

One of the reasons that asking multiple people for advice can lead someone to making the best choice is when he/she hears several different opinions. Hearing these different opinions will allow he/she to choose which opinion is the best for the given situation. Where as if he/she only went to one person for his/her opinion, it may not be the best possible advice for the situation. That is just one way asking multiple people for advice can lead to the best decision.

Another reason asking several people for their opinions can lead to the best choice made is when someone is looking for advice on a certain topic. When getting advice on a certain topic people want factual information and advice from someone who knows a lot on the topic. The problem is some people know more than others on certain topics. But the more people asked for advice, the more likely someone who is educated on the topic is to share his/her advice. Later whoever was searching for advice on the topic will be able to decide which one is the most factual and which one to actually follow through on in the scenario. That is the second way asking more people for advice can lead to the best choice made.

In the long run it is not smart to only go to one person for his/her opinion. Asking multiple people for their opinions will lead to more factual and correct advises as well as allowing whoever is asking for advice to make the optimal choice possible for the given situation.
