Well some people can be gifted in sports but not education. I know a lot of people that have trouble in school. Maybe its because of life at home or any other reason. I think its unfair for that too. We should be able to do sports with a C average at the least. I say C average would be the lowest because that's average. But any lower then C is not good at all. I have a not so good grade in math personally, but so do a lot of other people that's gifted in sports. I'm not very sure if I'm good at football or not but I'm trying it next year. What if i was looking forward to doing a sport all year and getting ready and training for it, but i made one bad test grade and it ruined my overall average and now i cant try out for the team. I would be very upset.

But then again i understand why you want your students to have a good B average. It makes the school look very good but also you will have more people trying there best on tests, quizzes or in classes generally. I'm on both sides but i think it would be best to have a C average because a lot of people have trouble and they really want to do sports. Thank you for reading this and hearing me out.
