Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that policy number two is a great policy.

I think this because if students are allowed to have phones it would be a distraction.

First this a good policy because without phones in school it would let students concentrate. Also because students would be able to do there work without using there phone. This policy would let the students to get good grades on there test. Students have the rest of the day after school to use there phone and text. This policy is also great because without having phones it would make this school a better one because it would show that the teachers want the students to do good and have a great future. There are many more great reasons why students should not be allowed to have phones during school. In conclusion that is some reasons why students should not be allowed to have phones during school hours.
