changing a policy

Kids should be able to participate in sports if they are passing with a c average .If you make it a b average we will hardly have any athletes to participate in any sports .I know that it would make the school look better but lets face it you wouldn't have any athletes to help us win championships .So we the students think it should stay to a c average to let athletes participate in sports .But the student would have to work harder to participate in sports , i know that but it would let them have fun playing their sports that they love to do after school .I think b average should take place ,instead of the c average because c average is to easy accomplish instead of the b average it would be alot harder because the student would have to work to get a b average to participate in any sport .We the student are going to have a vote to see who wants the b average or the c average .The results have came in and it looks like the students have picked c average .That policy has been wiped a way .C average has been set back to where kids have to have a c average to participate in any sports .
