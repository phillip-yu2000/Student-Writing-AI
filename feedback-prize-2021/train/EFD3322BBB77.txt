Dear Principal,

I would like to bring my phone to school because i need to call my parents after school. If I had to choose between policy 1 and policy 2, i would choose policy 1. I like policy 1 because i need to call my parents to see who is going to pick me up. If policy 2 was the one that you choose it would affect the school and the students that go to our school. Policy 1 would be the policy that would really help the school in a lot of ways.

Policy 1 has a lot of advantages and policy 2 has a lot of disadvantages. Policy 1 is the policy that would really help because it has more benefits. If students didn't have any cell phones there would be a big line in the office to use the phone. If you choose policy 2 there could be a lot of scary things that could happen. For example, if there was an emergency and we didn't have time to go to the office we couldn't take our phones out and use them because we don't have one. Another reason why i like policy 1 is because it is safer and we could were not going to use them in class because there going to be turned off. If policy 2 was the one that you choose it would the bad decision because phones are the communicate with people and if we don't have communication with our parents or guardians it could frighten our parents or guardians.

Policy 1 is the right policy to choose, it is safer and could help us by communicating. Policy 1 is the right decision because it helps us by communicating with our parents. Its really helpful to me because i know who is going to pick my sister and i up. Thank you for reading my letter principal and i hope u make the right decision.

Sincerely,
