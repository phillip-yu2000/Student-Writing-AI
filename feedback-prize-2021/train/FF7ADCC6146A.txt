I believe that driverless cars are a great invention for the people. It would be great for anybody in my personal opinion. I believe the sensors, Dubbed LIDAR,

and GPS receiver are great idea's fr a driverless car. Say you spilled a drink while you were driving and you needed to grab the cup before the liquid from the cup gets all over your school bag, or work porfolio? You could always switch on the "driverless" car feature and clean it up real quick before you started driving again. I like how you can switch this on and off. Say you were feeling sleepy and you were awake but you were kinda drowsy? You could use the driverless care feature. The vibrateing seats from Gm, The flashing lights informing you that there's something you need to do so take the wheel. Those are both great and fantastic idea's.

Safety is a big concern in these cars. Can the car stop when needed? can the car set off air bags in the middle of a crash so the crash is less deadly and there are no fatalities?

yes, i believe the cars in the future will be able to do everything listed above, and more. If somebody is injured by a smart car i believe it should be the manufactures fault, but only if the person driving the car is actually using the smart car feature. If the person driving the car isn't using the feature then the driver should be held responsible
