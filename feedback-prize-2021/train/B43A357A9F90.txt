Dear Principle,

I believe that the students should have a choice whether or not to do community service.

Yes, it would be better if everyone helped out in some way, but we shouldn't have it mandatory. Those who disagree with community service should have a choice, because they wouldn't give 100% in everything that they do, and we would expect that from them. You also want all the students to enjoy helping the community. If they don't have fun with it, then why would they want to do it?

If they like doing it, they will keep doing it.

But, one way to get others who do not want do community service is to have them help out with areas in their interest. Such as, if a cheerleader didn't want to do community service, offer her to help out with younger cheerleaders. She would probably be interested, and there would be a high chance that she would do it. Otherwise, if you offer that type of community service to a football player, there is a low chance he would do it.

Whether it be tutoring, babysitting,

or picking up trash, if anyone feels the need to do good, they will. If not, someone else will.

Thank you.
