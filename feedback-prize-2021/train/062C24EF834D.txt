What if you had to get a grade B average or better in order to participate in sports or other activities? You would probably try your hardest to get a grade B average!

I think if your really want something, you can get it! I think students will strive to get what they want. This will definitely push students to try their hardest and do their best in school. They won't be fooling around and not paying attention in class. If they know that they have to have a grade B average in order to participate in sports or other activities, it will make them realize that they have to pay attention and do their very best in school. If you know that students enjoy participating in sports and other activities, and you set a goal for them, they will try to reach that goal, to get what they want. I don't think it will be that hard to get a grade B average it you really pay attention in class, do all your work (including homework), and focus on school.
