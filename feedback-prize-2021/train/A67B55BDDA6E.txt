Dear Principle,

This opportunity you have come across is very supportive and sounds very interesting. Students that produce time to do community service have great lives ahead in which they are one step closer to achieving goals and wealthiness. While other student aren't caring and feel they are too good to stop and help the community, don't look to have such a wealthy lifestyle. Personally some students of the district and I feel that all students should perform community service. This would be one step closer to a green environment and healthier lifestyle. Classmates would be noticed as caring and thoughtful and the school district might also be noticed as an high achieving district. If Students were to have at least one hour per day to do community service there might be a chance to stop global warming. Some Students may volunteer to pick up trash off the side of highways, some may volunteer at nursing homes, and some may also volunteer in shelters of all sorts. This appears to have good results and honor for taking time out of everyday procedures to help somebody/something else. Once again I feel we should take position and students should be required to perform community service for the sake of saving the planet and what limited resources we have.
