Dear Principal,

I think that it is a good idea that you are only allowing people with a B average to be involved in sports. Its a good idea because students should earn the right to be in a sport or to be in a activity. I also think it will influence students who want to get involved in sports to pick their grade up to a B average or even higher. The reason I think this is because if someone really wants to be in a sport they would put in all their effort to be able to qualify, and get into the sport of their choice. I think the school should apply this rule to other school activities instead of allowing students with bad grades to be involved in activities witch people with good grades earned. Even though I agree with this rule I also think if you have a C average, but your just a few points away they should allow you to enroll in sports and activities. Overall i think this is a great new rule, and it will improve the school in academics and tests. This new rule will also change many students way of thinking and they will have a reason to raise up their grade and be more respectful towards the teachers, students, and even their parents. This new rule should be shared with schools all around California because it can change many student's lives. The new rule of only being able to be in school sports is you have a B average will have a big impact. The new rule might also get parents more involved with the school and kids because many parents want their son or daughter to be in a sport and they will push their children to do better in school. Teachers will have a way easier job and they will not have to be dealing with bad kids because there will be a less percentage of students wasting their time and fooling around in class.
