Some schools offer distance schooling for students to be able to learn from home, and would they benefit from it. Should more schools do this where you live. Here are some advantages to schools that do this.

One advantage to doing distance learning is there is no traveling. Students donÃÂ´t have to come to school everyday, and there parents donÃÂ´t have to bring them either. It is just allot less running around for the students and parents. They dont have to get up so early just to go to school. You just get right out of bed and get your work done.

Schools are doing it now so kids can spend more time with their family. They have to go to school for 8 hours a day ,then come home to spend little time with the family. Kids need that family time rather then going to school all day. The parents can help them do the work if needed. Just getting more support then at school.

I feel like if kids did their work at home they would get more work one. They dont have here friends there to distract them. They can have more time if needed to finish work rather than at school it has to be turned in at a specific time. If they got more work done hat means they would have better grades. Just make them have a better work ethic.

So after hearing about the advantages to doing distance learing would you like it if your school did it. I feel like it would be a btter idea in the long run for syudents to get more freedom while they are still getting their work done.
