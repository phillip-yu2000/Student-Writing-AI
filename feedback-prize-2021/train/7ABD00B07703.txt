The election process is complex, but not unreasonable. Over the course of several months, candidates travel across the country to speak out to the people of the United States and hopefully gain their vote. Finally, in November, the big moment arrives. It is the pinaccle of all their hard work - all the speeches they've performed, good deeds that have been promoted, and promises that were made by them lead up to then. However, who is truly voting for them? Is it the people, or a external party? The answer is the Electoral College, which is an essential part of our government. The process is well-organized, and aids us in selecting our president by using electors from each state to more accurately vote.

To begin with, without the Electoral College, there would possibly be less clarity in the election process. Moreover, there would not be the sense of fairness or equality when it comes to voting. Because of it, there is a reliable system in which the population votes, which is then brought to the state's electors to be evaluated and voted on unanimously. If it weren't for this, there would be the possibility of run-off elections in which there is no obvious winner since the votes are tied or very close. Thankfully, since the Electoral College uses a winner-takes-all method in the determination for each state's votes, the pressure "is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."
