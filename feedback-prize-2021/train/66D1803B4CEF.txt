I think the technology will work just fine in a class room. The reason i say that is becuase if someone feeling sad or down you can use the 3-D computer technology.`This technology really will help alot with clssrooms. This technology maybe make the world a better place. If you can tell how somebody is feeling with asking them you will know how to come off to that person.

The 3-D technology is so great. They read face experssions, modify test. They just know when you like something or you dont .The 3-D technology will be a huge step for the classrooms. It will help more and it really will take load off the teachers becuase if the students doesn't know will computer will teach them.

In the text it say's that if you make a bad face to a ad on the browser the ad will not be like the other one you didn't like. And if you simle at an ad the next one will be more simlar to the one you like. Its a good thing for your phone or PC to able to read your face experssion and can tell when you like something or when you don't. Another thing is if you work to hard or you don't understand, the 3-D can modify the test or work in other words it modify the work to the best way you can understand.

I think they should the use the 3-D technology step. Only becuase i like the way it works. It helps with work, tell others how feeling, and helping the work that might need help with. The technology will make alot of useage in the school feild thatnthey are to prusite it in.
