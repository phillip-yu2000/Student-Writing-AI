Can you imagine sitting in class taking a test on a computer and all of sudden you hear your teacher say, " The computer gave me a message saying by the way you are looking at the test the camera read your face, and is saying your 93 percent nervous and 7 percent confused. Why didn't you study? ". The computer read tour facial muscles and gave your teacher feedback. I think using technology to read students emotions would not be valuable in a classroom.

Even though have a computer or some machine telling me that i feel a certain way sounds cool, it's not going to benefit students in a school enviroment. I say this because , students already stress enough. Why tell them that they're stress? That will make thing worse. Say for instince, a student is having a bad day andhe comes to class mad your tell they're mad is just goin to make them MORE mad. In the artice it saids, "Eckman has classified six basic emotions..." there are way more than six emotions that exist. So what happens when your non of those emotions, say your depressed and computer says your angry, then the computer is wrong.

One other thing everyone says, phones and elcetronics are a destraction to teens, why bring a machine in to the agurement and tell the students they aren't in a good mood. So everytime they a feeling a certain way they are worried about someone else telling them how they feel because a machine said they feel some type of way. Therefore making the worry about someone elses in their business and trying to mask the emotions completely so a computer system won't detect any emotion, instead of doing the work assigned in class.

In conclusion, the use of technology is good to certain point, and bringing a machine that reads peoples emotions to a school with moody teens is not a good idea. It will eventually cause more problems that wouldn't of been started if someone else unwillingly told them how they felt.
