over the years cars have become a necessity in first world countries, they are used every day and alot of people wouldnt even have a job if it was not for cars. although these new innovations in technology are overly useful they sould not be used in excess because they could damage our evironment, save people money, and even make people stressed.

Cars are one of the main pollutants in the earth. as a mater of fact the first world countries are trying to convince the less developed countries to use less cars because of all the damage they have already caused. accroding to source 2 "after days of poluttion paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city" here you can clearely see how much of an impact cars have on the evironment. what is also interesting is that just after five days the smog cleared enough for the "french party to recind the ban for odd numbered plated" although it isnt a good thing that the french did not keep this law, it is astonishing to see how just limiting cars has such a good effect on the environment another reason why people shouldnt use cars so often is because they are very expensive to maintain. many americans spend a large portion of their income filling their cars gas thank. surprizingly accoring to source 4 americans are no longer bying as much cars due to the recession. this just proves the point that cars generate so much expense that most every day americans cant even afford one. if people drove there cars less there would be a significant increase in the amount of money they gain each month.
