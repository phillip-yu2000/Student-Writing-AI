Car accidents are one of the leading causes of death in America. With driverless cars, these accidents would be far less frequent. They have faster reflexes than any human. Also, once they are fully developed, accidents resulting from texing and consumption of alcohol will be a thing of the past.

In 1980, speed sensors were put on the wheels of cars to create antilock brakes. Since then, they have been further developed to sense dangerous situations and react to them. They can apply brakes and reduce engine power in a much faster manner than any human could. As this technology develops, cars will become much safer and more capable of handling situations on their own.

Most car accidents are caused by human fault. People consume alcohol, use drugs, are distracted by their phones, eat, and sometimes simply don't pay attention. With driverless cars, these things wouldn't be an issue. When driverless cars become fully developed, people can endeavor in whatever mindless activity they choose and not hurt anyone on the road. Road rage will become less of a problem. Speeding will be a thing of the past as well as many other traffic violations.

Driverless cars are a great idea. They will make the road a safer place and will be more convenient for people who like to multitask. The judicial system won't have to waste time and money dealing with traffic violations. All around, these would be benficial and I can't wait for them to be a part of our everyday lives.
