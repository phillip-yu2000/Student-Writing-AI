I am all for driverless cars.

This will make life easier on us as humans.

Cars that are programmed with computers and sensors will more than likely react faster than our human brains can.

This will lead to a great decrease in the number of car wrecks and fatalities involving cars.

Paragraph 7 says that in 2013 there was a BMW made that can steer, accelerate, and brake without a driver.

Technology is becoming more and more advanced everyday, and we should be optimistic and not shy away from this new innovation of vehicles.

Wouldn't you prefer a driverless car if you were incapable of driving.

The technology isn't quite there yet, but Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by the year of 2020.

In year 2016, or this year, a projection was made by Tesla that a car will be released with the capability to drive on autopilot 90% of the time.

All in all driverless cars can lead to safer cars, and easier lives for us.
