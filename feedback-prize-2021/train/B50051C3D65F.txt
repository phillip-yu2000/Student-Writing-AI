I think that you shold join this program and become a seagoing cowboy because it gives you many oppertunities to visit many places, like when I was a seagoing cowboy I went to Europe, Greece, and China. You also get to meet many people while you are on your trip.

While you are on you trip you get to spend alot of time with the animals on the boat but also one you drop of the animals you can play volleyball and baseball in the empty holds where the animals use to be. Also you can hold table tennise tournaments and many other things in the holds. Lastly you can make new friends with the other seagoing cowboy that are on the boat with you. I made many new friends while I was a seagoing cowboy. Also,I had a lot of fun being a seagoing cowboy and meeting new people.

Being a seagoing cowboy ment more to me,it wasn't just an adventure, it opened up the world and that ment alot to me."I'm greatful for the oppertunity,

and it made me more aware of what people of other countries and their needs."
