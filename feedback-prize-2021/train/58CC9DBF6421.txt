Unmasking the Face on Mars

If you ever saw or heard about the "Face on Mars" you might think that it was created by aliens but it's actually not. Everybody thinks it is but it's really just a natural landform.

A few days after NASA sent a camera up to Mars to look for Viking 2 it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. They said," it was a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth." The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It soon become a pop icon and it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines and on radio talk shows. Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars.

People starting believing that it was evidence of life on Mars. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photo. Everybody was waiting to see it but it revealed that it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Even after having all this evidence people sill didn't believe that it's not an alien because they said the pitcure was cloudy and could've been hidden. To prove everyone wrong, on a cloudless day they took a second photo with even better quality of the landform.

Finally, the picture could show you that it was not really a face but only a landform. Many people just want to believe that there is life on Mars when there most likey is not. They spent a lot of money trying to prove this to everyone that there is no alien life on the planet Mars.
