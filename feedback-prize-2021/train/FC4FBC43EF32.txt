Should all kids participate in a extracurricular activities? I think kids shouldnÃÂ´t be forced to play in sports, or join a club. They should have a choice to join anything or not. After school kids have may have work to do at home. They should go home and bond with their families. Kids should have the choice to join school activities or sports.

First, kids after school have more important things. Some have to take care of younger siblings, or family members every day. Some teenagers have jobs to support college funds or to help their family. To the students that work sports and clubs arenÃÂ´t very important and they need the job more. Schools should think about those students before enforcing this.

Second, five days a week for almost an entire year kids go to school for about eight hours a day. After school kids have homework, chores, and a social life to keep up with. Making them join extracurricular activities puts more on the student. They should be able to hang out with friends and family. Schools should try to be more helpful instead of putting more stress on their students.

Lastly, some cases activities can be good for children. Sports can help kids with depression or kids with a lack of friends. Sports can also get some students a scholarship to a college that they canÃÂ´t afford to go to. Clubs can help them what they are passionate about and want to work into further. Some extracurricular activities can help kids get healthier. Extracurricular activities can be helpful sometimes, depending on the student.

In conclusion, Sports and clubs shouldnÃÂ´t be forced onto students. The activities should be recommended and given time to think about. For some students, sports will benefit them but, for others it can give them stress. I understand the reason for the schoolÃÂ´s idea but I still believe they shouldÃÂ´t apply the rule to the school.
