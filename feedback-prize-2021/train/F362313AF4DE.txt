Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I have to say that ,I myself an 8th grader disagree, on your new school policy.

For the fact that , having a "C" average is better than an "F" average? Sports have influenced me the most, throughout the school year to keep my grades up. Our coaches here at SCHOOL_NAME, have kept the athletes informed, of some important information. Meaning in order to be an athlete , your grades have to be 75 or above.

If we do not meet the requirements we must not play in a game or also have some type of punishment, meaning running extra etc. . Being an athlete is very difficult. In my opinion I think, what the coaches are doing is fine. To change the school policy, i' m positive we would not exactly have a full team , 75 or above rule helps us all out. It gives our students the time to make up the grade.

My parents have always, told me in order to not be punished to bring home at least a 75 or up. I've been "A" , "B" honor roll, since kinder. Unlike most parents, my parents care about my education and at the same time they want me to have fun. so ,I became an athlete. TEACHER_NAME, if you must change the policy I promise you, your parents and staff won't be pleased due to this change.

If you must change the policy let it be the 75 average or above policy, to Join athletics.

You would still have a great team and successful students. Here at SCHOOL_NAME,

"we reach for the stars." Nothing less, so please TEACHER_NAME think about this choice long and hard. I'm counting on you, the whole school is.

p. s - You have made this school a wonderful place to be attending, let's keep it up.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
