The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is a very detailed, reliable article. It seems as though the author thinks it would be a good idea to find a way to have an exploration take place on our neighboring planet, Venus. In the authors final paragraph they state that "Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation." wich strongly indicates that the author thinks it would be good to invest in such an exploration. For the most part the author supports his idea well but there are some parts of this article that could possibly make some readers confused.

In most of the paragraphs of this exerpt the author is stating the danger that is involved in making an exploration to Venus. As much as the author states towards the beggining and end of the article how they beleive it would be a worthy pursuit, for most of the body paragraphs they dont seem too optimistic about the exploration. For example in paragraph 2 the author says that Venus is,"a challenging planet for humans to study ". Another example from paragraph 4,"The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?". These types of remarks seem slightly reoccuring in this exerpt. They also show that the author seems like they have alot of doubt in NASA's capability to continue with such a major journey.

The writer of this article was very knowledgable about the terms and conditions of mars,and what it would take to be able to do research on the planet itself. The majority of this exerpt consists of diffrences and similarities that venus and our home planet, Earth, have. For example in paragraph 2 the author exclaims that the two planets are referred to as "twins". An example of how they were contrasted, in paragraph 3,"On the planetÂ’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet." As you can see, the detailed facts in this exerpt are clearly reliable.

As much as it may be controversial, because the author did show alot of negative effects to exploring Venus, they did bring up some reasons how it could be a good idea to make an exploration like this, considering how alot Venus and Earth are. For example in paragraph 4, the author states,"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth." These examples show that the author is guving strong reason why it would be possible to make a expidition to Venus.

The article, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is very detailed, factual, and strong. Although it may not 100% express that the author is trying to say it would be a worthy pursuit to make an expedition to Venus, this article still would give people alot of information on Venus and reasons why we should or should not go there. This exerpt does express that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, for the most part. It may show more of the dangers and not as much why it would be worthy, but at some parts it does show that it would be a good idea. Some readers might be confused about weather the author thinks its worthy or not, but either way it is still very factual and a strong article to get a lot of information from.
