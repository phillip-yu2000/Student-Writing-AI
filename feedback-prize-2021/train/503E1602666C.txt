I think that you should join the seagoing Cowboy program because you can go over sea you can be at a certian place in just a couplle weeks but it all depens on how far away it is. My reason to join this program would be that evveryone should have a chance to do things that they can't do in a normal everyday life. This started a while back I was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no. I knew that it was an opportunity of a life time.

I knew this because it isn't everyday that you can go out to sea and go to a different country. This was my only chance to help out and go to another place, but if I would have said no then I would have never of gone to Europe and I would still be at home working to jobs and not being able to do much of anything but work and work and work. At my first trip I wasn't at Europe until after I was 18 when this happened I could draft myself for the U.S. army and would be able to do this all of the time. When they got my draft they told me to keep doing what I was doing. What I was doing was feeding the animals. Then on my second trip I

was on nightlook out. Every hour I had to check on the animals and make sur ethat there was nothing wrong with them. After a while it started to rain and I slid down the metal ledder and I cracked my ribs. But the best thing about this was that I could make my mark on the world. This is why I think that you should join the seagoing Cowboys.
