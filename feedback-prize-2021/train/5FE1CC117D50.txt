Dear Principle,

I think that students should be able to use there cell phone during lunch and other free times.

First of all, students cant cheat on test or any kind of work cause during school when they are learning, she cant have there cell phone on or if they do and there texting they will get caught. they wont do anything if they use there cell phone during school, just text other friends. I don't think that it would be bad if students use there cell phones. Especially cause there's no work during lunch, not unless the student has detention.

Second, I don't think that students will text in class cause they already got that urgent feeling of texting out. I think that teachers should be more aware if the students are texting in class or using there phone. I don't think that a student will try and cheat with other students during lunch. If you ever allow this, I think that if a student is caught texting or using phone during class, i think that they should get there phone taken away and having there parents come and pick the phone up. And if there caught a second time then they should not get there phone back.

Third, if I were a teacher, then I would pick up all phones before starting class and put them in a box. Then give them back after class. I think that is far and smart. I also think that ipods and other electronics can be used during lunch or any other free time. As long as the phone are turned of during class time then i think that the students should be able to use there cell phone and electronics during school.

So that's my opinion on why students should be able to use there cell phone and other electronics during school.
