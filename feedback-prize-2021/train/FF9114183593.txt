Driverless cars will help the economy increadibly. They will cut the public transportation costs in half! The cars are not fully functional by them selfs so far, they need the help of a driver to navagate through complicated traffic conditions. These cars will take over the wheel when you do not want to drive.

Some say that the driver would get bored waiting for "their turn to drive". Also others say it would not be fun sitting watching the car drive. But what they do not know is the developers have allready looked into that problem. The answer is a digital display windsheild, you can watch a movie on your window. You can call or text from your car as it is driving. So when it is your turn to drive the display would turn off and it would tell you that you have to take over.

The technology for this to happen is here, all the developers need is your help to see if the people would want them. Imagin not having to worry about crashes, speeping drivers, drunk drivers, or taking the wrong way home. This car will eliminate thoes senarios. Less speeding tickets you have to pay, less insurance, and less money to spend on gas.

These cars will be great for the world. You will love one, just imagin thoes long road trips that you will not have to drive. Maybe you have paperwork due that day on you way to school, or work, you can do it beacuse your car is driving. The development of these cars will be amazing. This is why you, yes you shoud support the development of these cars.
