I believe that students should have an B average or higher to participate in after school sports or activities because many students fail school or have under a 3.0 G.P.A. and they believe when they grow up the will become a basket ball player or a football player and don't think highly of their own education. They think when they grow up they will become a rich and famous athlete or an artist but they don't understand why they need a an education to do so. Most schools have a rule that you must have a 2.0 or higher to do sports or activities after school and that is one of the only reasons most children decide to work at all is to be able to take these pleasures after school. Students will understand that having a B average or higher grants you these after school festivities.

One day the child that grew playing a sport such as basketball is going to go out for the NBA and there's only one spot left but the person next to them is much more talented and gets the spot, they have nothing to fall back on they don't have the knowledge to know what to do next. But when they where in school and did after school activities and sports and kept that B average they learned something along the way and they learned what to do next. They had a plan if plan A did not work because they had kept that B average and learned they may even have gained more struggling to be on say the track team then just going to school and coming home. The back up plan is what will create are future doctors, lawyers, inventors and scientists. That is why i would argue with the principal if he/she decided to change the grading policy to B average to do after school activities or sports.
