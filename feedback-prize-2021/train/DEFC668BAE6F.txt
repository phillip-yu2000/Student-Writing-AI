Venus, Earth's "twin" sister is a extordinary planet that may have been the most earth like planet in our solar system according to paragraph 4. It is also stated that Venus may have probably been covered largely with oceans that could support all form of life. Due to the dense atmosphere and toasty temperatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. It has been impossiple to let alone land on venus but even taking samples of Venus's rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. Many drones have been sent there to gather information about Venus according to paragraph 2. Each mission to land on Venus has ben unmanned due to the problem of no spacecraft not being able to survived the landing for more than a few hours. Even with all these issues with venus, stated in paragraph 7. NASA is still working on other approaches to studying Venus because again it is a extordinary planet that is said to have been suitible for all forms of life. Finding out what happend to make Venus be in the state it is right now would help the human race from stopping Earth from becoming like Venus. There has been many ideas to get a view on venus ground conditions such as peering from a orbiting ship but that would only give a limited insight due to the dense atmosphere. On paragraph 6 it is stated "Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus". That just goes to show you how landing on Venus or even getting the smallest bit of sample of it is a worthy pursit despite the risks and dangers of it. The curiosity of the human race is a powerful thing, Even though Venus is described as a dangerous planet. One day we will figure out the secrets Venus hold and perhaps even have a human land on the surface as well, until then we will just keep on working on more innovations that will one day allow us to get the insight of Venus.
