Dear Principal,

I would have to disagree with the B average to be in sports or other school activities. There are many students in our school that love sports, mostly guys, but they shouldn't just have a B average to participate. Many students with C averages want to do or just love sports and school activities but they wont be able to do any if you change the grade average. I don't think the grade average should matter on whether if students should or should not participate in the school sports or activities. So many students that go to the schools want to be in sports or activities but wont be able to if the grade average changes. If you change the grade average then some students wont be able to get the daily exercise that they need. Maybe the sports and activities at school are the only things some students look forward to be doing during or after school days. If the grade average ends up changing some kids will think that they wont be able to do anything else because they aren't in the sports or activity programs. They may feel like if they are able to be in the sports or other school activities then they aren't able to do anything else.

Some students may need everyday exercise but wont be able to get it because they don't have the right grades to participate in the school activities or sports. Please TEACHER_NAME take it into consideration that most students in the school wont be able to participate in the school if you change the grade average. Think of how many students will be upset when they find out that they wont be able to do any activities or sports. But thank you for your time to read this letter TEACHER_NAME and I hope you take my words into consideration.

Your student,

STUDENT_NAME
