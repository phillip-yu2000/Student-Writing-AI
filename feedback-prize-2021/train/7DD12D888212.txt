Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Most of students attend classes came from houses and we were be tired always because woke up the morning ,so I don't think way of online is not fair ,also I have other reason.

First, the online don't have to wake up early. Get up the morning is important that it one of the basic habit, so If is not use to wake up, It's going to get bad habit in the further. I said is online is not fair because we were suffering at schools and can't get out of schools until finish school but the online don't need to be suffering at school then they don't have to go school.

Seconds, schools is beginning of society or community. All of people get knowledge by people then combine to team and work together that is important, but online just study alone ,also no body around there and they can't work with someone. Most of schools have sports that help makes friend ,then other sports need to communicate to team like football team ,therefore is not just sport team that possibly is Work place, so online is opposite side because alone is not going to be happen to communication.

Finally, how to make friends in the online. Most of students don't like to go schools but when we go school with friends,schools is enjoyable little bit and If we have serious problems, we can share with friends ,also can consult about that ,but the online can't make friends easily. Honestly, how they are make friends in the online? However, Online is just bad choice in our life.

In conclusion, I can understand wake up the morning is hard and some people is difficult to make friends in the school, but way of online is beneficial. We should be join the community and when you got something hard to solve problem, ask teacher because teacher know life. Do not just sit down the chair at house. Get up from chair and just go attend the schools. Online is never helpful to life experience.
