In the world we live in, everyone has a cell phone. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. They should not because it is a distraction, and the call or text can wait.

The call or text can wait because you have to take your eyes off the road to answer or reply. Many times when you're texting and driving you misspell words and then you have to go back and correct it. So therefore when you go back and correct it your eyes are still off the road. This also means you are risking your life and someone else's life by being on the phone . In addition this leads to my next reason.

Cell phones are a distraction. They are a distraction because if you get a notification you're going to look for your phone. You can look down for 1 second and anything can happen. Also when people talk on the phone they are distracted. They have a tendency to look ways that they aren't supposed to and they drive crazy.

In conclusion drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. It is a distraction and the call or text can wait. Remember when you drive you have to drive for yourself and drive for others too. So try to avoid texting or answering and call while driving especially if it's just a friend.
