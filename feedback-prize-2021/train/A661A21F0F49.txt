Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Have you ever been coming home from school and had a sudden emergency come up?

Or really wanted to tell someone at a different lunch table something, even though you are not allowed to get up? These would be convenient times to be able to use our phones and possibly could help with texting in class too.

Have your parents ever needed to contact you in a bad predicament? Sometimes accidents happen and your guardians may need to speak with you for your safety. If you will not allow students to have their phones at school they could be put in danger. There have been days I have gotten sick walking home and needed to call my mom to tell her, if I did not have my phone I could not let her know. Sometimes having a cell phone on you is better for your invulnerability or health.

Most of my friends sit at a different table than me at lunch and there are times I need too tell them something or ask them a question. The thing with our school is you have assigned tables at lunch that you sit at with your class. On more than one occasion I have needed to speak with one of my friends that sits clear across the room from me and had no way to do so with out getting in trouble. We should be able to text at lunch at least.

This could, in the end, help with texting in class. If there was a time we were authorized to text freely it could get it out of our systems before we return to class. This would mean less to say or speak casually about during instruction time. I am sure many people would agree with me on this subject and this is a win-win situation. When we can have our phones could revolutionize how we learn, starting in SCHOOL_NAME.

Your student,
