What do I think about driverless cars? I am for them and I am also against them at the same time. I do think that driverless cars are good for people who do not know how to drive very good, and for people who do not want to drive. I don't want them because I like to drive, and I like cars.

I think driverless cars would be good for people who are bad drivers, because then those people would not be causing trouble on the road. Also people that are scared driving would be better for them so they wouldn't be nervous and could relax in the car.

The reason I do not want driverless cars though is that I want to drive, I don't want a computer to do it for me. I love cars to and its fun driving them, what would be the point of that dream sports car you always wanted if a computer was going to drive it for you. Also, computers are pretty smart but they dont know everything for instance, if a deer runs infont of you on a backroad would the car know that usually more deer come after that, or would it slam into the second deer, would it know the roads like you do.

So I am for them and against them. I think I would be better if they were optional so if you didn't want to drive you could buy one but if not you can still buy a normal car.
