Dear School,

I think we should be able to use are phone at lunch periods and in the morning in case of a emergency or in case if you left something at school and we should be able to have phone or ipod in the class to listen if it is like a Friday or free time we already use them for book on ipod so why cant we are and the phone thing is bad all 14 year old student should have phone cause what if the school started on fire or you got in trouble and the office doesn't know your parent number and say what if you got left after wresting practice and you didn't have a phone cause the people at the office leave right when school get out. I think we should not have them out in class cause it a distraction of what more than important than learning. The teacher unusual never let us use there phone to us so that we can call and some people at the school don't have your parents number then what do u do cause i know a lot of people who can remember number with out there phone or phone books. I think they should check or do some so that they know the student phone or ipod is off during class. I think we should have a time on Friday or every off Friday when you can take your phone out at your last period class and play around with it and other peoples phone maybe or we could have a thing in tech ed about how the phone works and the electronic engineer in to it.
