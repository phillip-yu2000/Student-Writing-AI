Dear Principal I think getting a b average is very absurd because people try there best to get higher than a c but not everyone is smart. Anyways what's wrong with a c. C'S are good for sports. If you were to have b average only for sports you would only have like 6 or 7 players on a team or something because its hard to get straight B'S

and no c. If u were to ask the kids what should we do have a b average for sports or c average. I bet everything I have that everyone would say c average for other activities. Another reason why it should be c average because the best players on team would be the c average students. Without the best players we would lose every game or be crushed by other students in other teams We would want students to try their best at these activities because they can end up being something in the future like kids can follow their dreams to go to the NBA or something. You can also raise money for these sports activities by telling people to watch the game you must pay a dollar and that's nothing people wouldn't mind. Family members would love to see there sons play and the more the players the more money you guys can raise. Or you can raise money like on game day you can pay a dollar to dress down and a lot of students would pay to dress down. This is why i think we should have c average for sports or activities.
