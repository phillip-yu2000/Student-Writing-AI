Dear Principle,

I do think that community service should be required to all students. I say this because that more that we do around the community, it will keep us children even adults well rounded. To assure that we will be doing our certain amount of community service, you should have a list of options that we can have so that we can do something we know will be interesting. Also the more we help out it will be helpful to those who cant help themselves or the elderly, or even more gentle babysitting. I do see that other children may have things going on in their lives like sports or family. the reason of me saying this it could and probably will keep most children out of trouble as well as, keeping them well rounded or just helpful.

overall they can and most likely will be benefited by this. so all in all i do think that community service will and should be required to all students.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
