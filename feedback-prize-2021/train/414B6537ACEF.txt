As I read this article about Driverless Cars, my mind wonders to a whole lot of problems. Although right now I am not directly affected by this because I have yet to get my license, I dont find the driverless car project as a good idea.

The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of a Driverless car taxi system is a limited budget which means a limited amount of driverless cars. Also, how much would these cars cost? In paragraph 10 it states the vehicle makers "Tesla, Mercades- Benz, Audi, and Nissan". These car companies already sell higher end regular cars at high prices, let alone a so called Driverless Car.

A big position on my behalf of Driverless Cars would also be safety. As stated in paragraph 9, "If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?". Everyday technology fails in some way, shape or form and people in turn get hurt, injured and sometimes killed. My question to myself that I am pondering would be, "how safe is it to step into these Driverless cars and be able to trust that something won't go wrong?"

For decades now, people have had to learn how to drive. Some would even say that there is a thrill that comes from driving and that it keeps your mind alert. So what is the point of a Driverless Car? In paragraph 8 it says "wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?" This statement tells me that humans like to drive and that in a car where we wouldn't need to be alert or wouldn't need to do anything, we would get bored. So when I asked "What is the point of a Driverless Car?" I believe the answer would be that the human species is lazy and a Driverless Car would mean less work and more relaxation.

In the end, I do not see a time in the future where there is no need to buy a car anymore. Driverless Cars and our roads would need a lot of work before it could be anywhere near possible to have a car drive itself by 2020.
