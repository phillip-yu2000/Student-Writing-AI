Hello,I am Luke Bomberger and here to convince to be a part of the Seagiong Cowboys program. When I was a part of this program I really liked it I did a lot of fun things like baseball,volleyball,table-tennis. fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling of when we had extra time,but there were down-sides to being overseas like I did not get see my family much or friends.

I really liked when I got to help people in need. It gave me a sense of awareness and a purpose I even got to host a number a international students and exchanged visitors(hopefully one of will be able to do this one day like me).

If you like traveling you will really like this

I crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help hurt in World War two. There also a lot of amazing places like an excavated castle in Crete and Panama Canal on my way to China.

It is also a long voyge to get from place to place it took me a month to get to China and two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States,but my task kept me busy like feeding the animals and cleaning there cages.

I really liked being a Seagoing Cowboy. It was always a really fun every day there was always something new to help people with. I hope you will join the program and if you do good luck by the way you will do great.
