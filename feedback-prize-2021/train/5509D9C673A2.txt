Many students I know likes to do community service,

including myself. Others I know doesn't like to do it. Sometimes they don't have time to do it, or others just don't want to do it. To me community service is a great idea for students to do something good for their future. But like I said others may not have time to do community service.

In order for you to require students to perform an act of community service it is better if you give an announcement during school, or put up a poster around the halls about the idea you have. Better yet ask their parents about the idea and they could talk to their sons / daughters. The plan you have is a good idea but you must find out it the students do community service by checking their permanent records. Then you may ask if they would like to do this.
