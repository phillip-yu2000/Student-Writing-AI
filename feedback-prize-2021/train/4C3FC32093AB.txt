Dear Principal,

I'm writing you on regard to the A or B average policy that the school has, In my opinion I do not think it is fair for those who are wanting to participate in sports and activities and cant because of their grade average. When most of our students have a C average. It would be much better if they have a good discipline record or even you should permit students to have a C average I think it would personally be better. Not only just for me but for the students as well. If you want students to be more involved in there school sports or activities why hold them back just because they have a C average. Or maybe even just help them get to that point where its an , A or B average. Like getting them involved in tutoring or some way where their teachers can help them catch up with what there missing in order to get to that wanted average. Because if you just base it on a certain average students wouldn't want to get involved. And im pretty sure that is not what you want, We don't want to make students feel as in they are forced to be in school not at all. So why not help them out a bit and I think with all due respect you need to fix this issue. Students aren't liking the fat that they cant get involved because of their C average.

Sincerely Yours,

STUDENT_NAME
