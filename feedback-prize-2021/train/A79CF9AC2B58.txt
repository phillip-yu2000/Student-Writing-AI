Teachers give you projects you don't want to do because the topic is too hard or you don't have interest in it is the worst feeling ever. Students should be able to decided what projects they complete during the summer break because it would mean more to them, if they could pick a topic they savior.

Students should design their own summer projects; we all know that projects can be very challenging and time consuming. However, it gives students an activity to do over the summer break rather than staring at the walls or playing on their PlayStation, Xbox or laptops all summer. When students design their projects they will most likely remember to do these projects if they had the power to create them. Therefore, students will produce greater and better projects and put more time and effort into them.

Therefore, allowing these projects to be students designs would be unquestionably beneficial for the students. Teachers would make these projects too hard and students will lose interest in doing it. Students can pick any topic as they please; forcing a student on a topic is not good, it will lead them to not having any ideas or them being stuck on a topic and worst: them not finishing the project. With the freedom of design students can have a topic on the solar system, school food, phone usage in class and bullying. It gives them the opportunity to do creative things with their work. Student designed projects gives them more space and freedom to develop an idea and put more effort into the project so they can get the credit they desire.

As a result, although many teachers worry that over the summer break, students will forget about most of what they have learned during the school year. The solution is to assign students projects over the summer that the students can design , so they can maintain knowledge and be ready for the next school year.
