Dear principal,

I really think you should go with policy one. because kids in school will start to take them out anyway and you will have to take tons of phones away. The students will not be happy with policy one because it prohibits all cell phones. Cell phones do not cause controversy. if you were to take cell phones away completely it will make kids in your school create riots. They will be angry at teachers for not allowing people to have their phones out during lunch hours.

I really think you should allow cell phones on campus. As long as they do not take them out in class it should be ok. Also some parents tell their kids to never turn their phone off in case of emergency. i really think that is a big deal. What if something is going on at home and they need you to know about it as soon as possible. You would have no idea what happened until you left school and got home. Something really severe could have happened during that time.

Another reason you should allow cell phones as in policy one is that if you didn't allow them at all and anybody took them out they would be taken. Kids would be really angry. They would start to go on riots and get extremely mad at the principal for allowing this rule. Nobody in your school would be happy and it would be torn apart. Sometimes kids have medicine and their parents have to contact them but they would not be able to because of the policy.

Please allow kids to have their cell phones out during passing periods and lunch time. It would save the school so much grief. The kids in your school would like to be there. But also now how the times are you have touch screens and unlimited internet search and things like that. People would go crazy because they cant do all that during passing periods and lunch.

When you would get home you would spend all of your time on your phone and not doing homework. So please i say once more, allow kids to use their phones during passing periods and lunch.

sincerely,
