Should we the people allow driverless cars to be sold and manufactured? Yes, yes they should be manufactured and sold to the public because of how much easier and less hectic and stressed life would be in the future. Driverless cars should be allowed to be built and 'driven' in every state in the United States of America.

Driverless cars have a lot more pros than cons. With driverless cars that google cofounder Sergey Brin has designed and envisioned, these cars can go miles and miles with out needing to fill up with gas. Also they can get through tight situatuions since they'd be much more flexible than a bus. As Brin says, "[cars such as these] would fundamentaly change the world.". Google has modified a Toyota Prius and tested it's driverless skills; it has gone farther than half of a million miles with zero crashes.

The facts stand, driverless cars are simpler, smarter, and easier to use that we've ever thought before. This is the future; why stop it when you can embrace the change and hold on for the long run? Driverless cars must be made legal in the United States so that Americans can have peace of mind when going on long trips or even just driving to town. Make the peoples lives easier and all around better; give them driverless cars.
