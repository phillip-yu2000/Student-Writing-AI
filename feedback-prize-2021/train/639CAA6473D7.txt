I am for the use of this technology becaus it would help kids who are confused in a way that they don't know what to do on the assignment or how to begin working. This technology will put the words in a different way for the student to learn the material after the computer learns their emotion and know what to do about it.

When adults or young teens plan on getting jobs that envolve on sitting at a dest they might get frustrated and don't know what to do and the computer would be able to detect thier emotions and take a different approach and help you undertsand the work faster. By getting work faster this will emprove the work production and people wouldn't have to stay for late hours to get work done.

This will help computers understand the different emotions that are going through people and the computer will react to it pretty quickly. I think this will be very helpful in the future to child to adults. While the computer still learns different emotions they will help people around the world and education will be a higher percentage of students will go to college and stay in school because of this technology.
