Asking for more than one person for advice can help the outcome.

It is helpful to seek advice from others, because it could give you a different view or solution for your questions.

Their opinion could have been something you have never thought of before. For this reason you have many different things people think of, since not everybody thinks the same. Advice can be good or not so good, but having someone give you more than one answer can help you decide which is best for you.

A different outlook on things can benefit the choices you make. Asking advice can change the way you thought about your choice, and help you make a different one.

Sometimes you could be stuck on something and asking one person for advice may not be enough.

While making a decision you may have some second thoughts, asking more people could help you decipher which works for you to complete your task.

Even having a discussion with a group could help open up some new ideas.

Having different people have different takes on your opinion. Sharing these ideas helps us communicate better and understand things more than we thought.

Others opinions and thoughts of advice can be something to argue against, but it helps us understand the person better. listening to others can also make them feel good and heard, hearing them out of what they want to say. They even may have something you would want to use in the future.

Listening to others opinions and getting a different outlook may just help you in your everyday life with tasks.
