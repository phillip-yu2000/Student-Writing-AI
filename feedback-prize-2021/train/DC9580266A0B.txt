The technology would be valuable to see if a student is having trouble in the class room. To see confusion and being scared that they might not perform well. this could help teachers get to the students that really need the help. Grades would theoretically go up now that the students that had trouble are getting the help they need. There are concerns about privacy to a computer tracking and watching you the moment you get on.

The technology would greatly impact teachers and students because now teachers now have a way to see how students are doing. Teachers could watch on their computers and when a icon comes up on a certain student that. They are showing signs of distress or confussion she or he could go over there and help them. Like said earlier grades of students would go up if they got the help they needed. The computer system says it watches for facial muscle movements and twitching and others like if the person is blinking a lot. Would set off signs that the computer measures and calculates how and what you are feeling. Also worry about privacy of students and teachers a machine watching you the moment you get on. That keeps a record of how long you were on and what you were doing of course most computers already do that. Maybe if it goes outside a certain range of school the software will stop but the computer can still be used.

The software like this one could help teachers help educate children to be the best they can. By going to the source of their problems seeing exactly the problem their having trouble with. There are positives and negatives like there is to everything but this could really help and boost kids to excel to their bests.
