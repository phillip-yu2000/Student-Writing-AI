Venus is the closest thing to Earth in our solar system scientists claim. We can't even explore it though because of many factors. It would be great to explore Venus and see if any life forms once had inhabitted it. There would be many advantages with having another planet.

Venus being able to support humans would be a great thing for the world. The air pollution in the world right now is very high. Once our ozone breaks away completly we will fly to Venus and pretty much start over. It might be a crazy idea but it could work. The ozone on Earth won't last forever. We just have to figure out a way to safely inhabit Venus.

Venus has many problems when it comes to conditions to live there. The atmosphere is made of mostly corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperatures on Venus' surface is also around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure alone on Venus is 90 times greater than Earth, that's enough pressure to crush a submarine. Scientists will have to brainstorm some amazing ideas to try and inhabit Venus.

Scientists can barely even learn anything about Venus with our technology to date. Even if we take a blimp 30 miles above Venus to try and do research, it will still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Also you won't be able to see the ground do to the atmosphere, it's so dense it doesn't let in any light. Scientists will try and resort to older technology to maybe get some data from Venus. They will use mechanical machines instead of machines containg computers. This may lead to the machine lasting long enough on Venus for scientists to gain enough data to try and send a human there.

Scientists have a heavy task ahead of them if they want to inhabit Venus. There are many factors that make exploration of Venus difficult, hopefully scientists can figure out ways to get around them. We will just have to wait and see what the future holds for the exploration of Venus.
