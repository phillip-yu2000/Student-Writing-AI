I feel that we should not have driverless cars. They could malfunction while someone is riding and cause an accident. There are also a lot of flaws to them. I also feel that most people wouldn't be able to afford them and then companies are wasting money. Why would a company make something that won't sell very well?

As I said, they could malfunction while someone is driving. A wire could be loose or the sensors could stop at any time. The car may not even be able to tell you that there are issues if there is a problem on the main circuit. What would happen if I hit somebody because my sensors stopped working? In the article it said that they are not sure if the blame is on the driver or the company. To me that's unfair, I wouldn't purposely hit somebody. There are too many flaws to this idea and even more could occur down the road. It's too unsafe and multiple disasters are more than likely to occur.

These cars would also cost a lot of money. In today's economy, a lot of people are struggling to even get jobs. They wouldn't waste money on something they don't need. They have a car that they can drive themselves, that's more safe. People would also have to pay for gas and probably have to get it checked out for multiple reasons. How much would all of it cost?

Overall I feel it could be helpful in some ways but would you really trust a driverless vehicle? You wouldn't just send your kids in a car with no driver. It doesn't seem very safe and I feel that there are too many flaws. I wouldn't continue developing them for cost reasons and safety issues. Once you fix one flaw, you are more than likely to just find another. This is why I feel we should quit developing driverless cars.
