Dear Principle,

You should allow students to have cell phones in school for these reasons: to notify parents to pick the teen/child up after school, to call if there is an emergency, if the student has to come home early, to let the parents know they will be late if that have rehearsal for school plays, detention, etc. These should be examples for students to have cell phones, but there might be other reasons to have cell phones at school witch might be to numerous to say.

If students use phones during school they should be taken away for 1-2 weeks, or maybe longer. If they use a cell phone during class they should immediately be given to the principle for safe keeping until the student can receive their cell phone. It should be alright if they can use their phones between classes when they go to their locker for as long before the next class starts, but if they are late and still in the hall way with their phone, should it be taken away.

If the students phone has been taken away the teacher or principle should let the parent know what happened. If students still disobey the new rules there should be a parent teacher conference. If there is a conference the teacher should tell the parent to keep the students phone or to tell them what to do if this keeps happening.

If the student follows the rules there should be no problem, unless if they start bringing their phone again. This is why I think both policies would be good choices.
