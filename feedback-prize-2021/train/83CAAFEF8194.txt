Dear Reader,

I would first off like to say that I agree with your new policy, that students must have a grade B average in order to participate in any sports, or other activities,

for school. If students can't keep their grades up, then I think that they could possibly need more time to study, or do homework, rather then playing sports.

Your grade averages ''follow you'' onto high school, and so depending on how well your grades are, determines whether or not you could perhaps get scholarships to college(s). Which financially takes a toll off of you, because you wouldn't have to pay for tuition.

I understand your point of view. Your just trying to help students keep well grades, so they're better off in the future. Some students may not exactly understand that, yet, but I'm sure they'll realize your trying to do what's best. By focussing on the priority of encouraging them to make good grades, and then they can have the option to take extra activities.
