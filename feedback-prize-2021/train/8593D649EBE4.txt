Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I know that us student are responsible for our grades in school but a B average just to play sports or be i some sort of activity is pretty dumb most students have C averages if you change this policy you will have lots of mad parents or students i think you don't want to be the bad guy here. I think and i think i speak for the whole school we at least should have a D average because if you really want to play in a sport or do an activity you should keep your grades up above an

F that way you passing you class or classes but you also know that its not all fun and games you have to do your studies first in order to be in any type of activity and if you do good in school you can accomplish anything in life. I know parents say that its good to be in any type of sport but you have to like its because it keeps you out of trouble well its true i mean if you change this policy you might see this straight student go from a good student to always calling his/her patrol officer to see if he/her doesn't have any type of weapon's please TEACHER_NAME think about how this is going to affect the students and our community.
