Having a car that will drive on its own is cool and all, but when you think about it it could be very dangerous. People in todays society are very lazy. All most people do now in days is sit at home, sleep, eat, or watch televison. So I dont think having a driverless car is such a good idea.

See people today get used to things quick without really noticing that they are used to it. For example television, its a great invention but people over use it. Some people make television their top priority. People even use television as an excuse. It stops them from making interactions with the real world, because people have grown to be lazy.

Another example is a cellphone. Everywhere you go everyone has a type of cellphone, wether it's a smartphone or a flip phone. People are so drawn to their phones especially teenagers. Everyone is on some type of social media sight, wheter it's facebook, instagram, snapchat, etc. Again everyone is making technology their top priority.

Having a car that can drive itself isn't really a good idea. We as humans get lazy over just little things, so imagine having a driverless car. What if someone in the driverless car falls asleep? In the passage it says this "driverless car" isn't so accurate. Meaning it can't drive itself completely. The driver still has to be alret of whats going on. So knowing us as humans and how we are why would anyone want to make a driverless car.

I honestly believe this car will be dangerous. SOmeone could fall asleep from getting too comfortable, again us being humans and getting used to things, causing the driver to possibly get into a car accident not only risking themselves but other pedestrians.

I am not in anyway shape or form trying to say technology is bad, but if it isnt used correctly it can be a dangerous thing. I beleive only people who are responsible and mature and know right from wrong are the ones who caan handle this type of technology. These "driverless cars" are not for everybody.
