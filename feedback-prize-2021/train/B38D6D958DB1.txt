In this essay I will be talking about when people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more then one person because they are trying to get other point of views then just one point of view. first you can ask like your friends they well be brutally honest and if they are not then they might be doing it for your own good for you so they dont hurt your feelings and so your friends would help you. Also ask different ages of people so you can get more point of views so you can get mute- perspectives on what your talking about. Another idea that you could do is ask your parents cause they have prrbollay been thought things like this so ask them.

Why it would be a good idea to get more point of on the thing you are talking about because getting their people thoughts can help you in So many ways. Like asking friends and or family can always give you advice. Otherwise you can ask teachers can help a lot cause I ask my teachers on point of view before anyone because they have helped so many kids in there life time it is insane.

One other thing is that asking different ages an help the more older you ask the more wiser your answer will get. Like if you ask you grandparent they know more then all kid combined because they have been through twice as much as we have. Almost every person will go through something that we need more input in and we will ask older people to help us and they will help us as much as they can.

Asking you parents is a good idea to casue they have know you ever since you were born and they know you better then anyone so if you need good advice I would go to them first and the grand parents and then friends because they will help you more then anyone could.

In conclusion asking for advuce can be hard sometimes because you could get in trouble casue there is a right time and a wrong time.
