Driverless cars are becoming less of a fantasy and are quite possible to create in the near future. I personally feel that the production driverless cars would not benefit our society because of the dangers of an electronically controlled car and the legal issues the can arise from them.

There are already many dangers that come with cars that have drivers, but so many more come along with a driverless one. If the cars stops responding to instrictions, it can become a servere hazard and start skipping stop signs, red lights, or even begin driving on the sidewalk. Another issue that comes with that is who to blame for the accidents. As the article said, we can blame the manufacturer or the people in the car. However, how can we determine who is to blame? The court process would be far too much effort for the case. This incident will also likely occur more than once, causing even more drama.

The idea of a driverless car sounds like a good innovation and could be very useful. But when looking at the danger and legal issues that come with the cars, the production of them just doesn't seem worth it to me.
