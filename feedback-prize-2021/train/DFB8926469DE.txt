Hi my name is Jaki , and I would not be against the Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify humans emotions because this system could hlep us and not just us but help the teachers to notify them if there student are confused , bored , ect . As in the acticle Dr. Hanug explains "even though individiuals often show varying degress of expressions". Another example of why I am not against this is because from the article it said that we humans perform this the same impressive "calculation"

everyday for instance you can probably tell hiw a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course , most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy .

In Conclusion , With the examples that I just gave I think this is why we should have the facial acting coding systems because it alerts us about how there people are feeling and we can solve if it is needed.
