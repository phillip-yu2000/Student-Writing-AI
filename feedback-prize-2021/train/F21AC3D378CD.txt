who think

Dear Senator

I heard recently that you might be taking away the electoral college.  If you dont know allready the electoral college is a process founded by our fuounding fathers in the constitution.  In the article "In defence of the electoral college" they say,"no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.  so a solid regional favorite, such as romney was in the south, has no incentive to campagin heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pulralityin the states that he knows he will win."  this keeps the election 'fair' and the canidates cant just pick a region and "take over."

I understand that when you use the Electoral college system you vote not for the president but for a slate.  allthought this is your still putting your vote towards a president.

In the article "In defence of the electoral college"the electoral college restores some of the weight in the policital balance that the large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution.  The Electoral college keeps the votes balance in the states.  These are some reasons you should consider before you take away the Electoral college, and remember like source 3 say "voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who thinkthat a single vote may decide an election."
