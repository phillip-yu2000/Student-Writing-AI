Luke Bomberger is one of the best seagoing cowboys to ever live he traveled the most trips wich is nine. Im convincing you to be a seagoing cowboy because you would get to travel on boat and take care of animals. If you really like all of those things you get to do being a seagoing cowboy is the job for you. A lot of people love doing this so I think that you would love it to you can even get your friends to do it with you. Some of the places you get to go to is China, and across the Atlantic Ocean.

It takes about two weeks to travel the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern coast of the United States. It takes about a month to travel to China. You have to get stalls that you can put your animals into so you can feed them and wash them. Once you drop your animals off you can start to get back on the boat and sail back. The fun part is of sailing back is you get to do fun things such as table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games to help pass time. Also it is great to get outside and adventure and open up the world to yourself.

I am trying to encourage you to become a seagoing cowboy because if you like to travel and be on a boat with animals then this is the job for you. If you do become a seagoing cowboy remember its a lot of responsibility that you have to take care of. When the job is over you get to play games on your way home. Right when you get back you dont have to get more animals and go straight back to the job. If you want you can spend time with your family and chill out. This is a seagoing cowboy convincing you to become a seagoing cowboy.
