So driverless cars are coming and what is your opinion on them? Do yo think they are a good thing? Do you think they are a bad thing. I'm here to tell you why I think driverless cars are a good thing for people.

First of all, speed limit would be followed by everyone. Usually people don't drive the speed limit. If driverless cars happen, then we can make them go the speed limit. I think going the actual speed limit will reduce car accidents.

Second of all, the person in the car could still take control of the vehicle if needed. This is a good thing because if a turn or park is to difficult for the car itself, then the driver can take control and do the obstacle for the car. This will prevent the car from malfunctioning.

Finally, I think it will make it easier on a lot of people. If someone is handicapped the car is there to just drive for them if they can't drive for a long time. I also personally think it will reduce accidents because of how fast you are going.

In conclusion, Driverless cars are coming and while there are downsides, I feel that positive overweighs the negative. That is why I am for driverless cars. Do you think they are good thing for people?
