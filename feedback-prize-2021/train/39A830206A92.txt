Most people might not know what Seagoing Cowboys are, but that dosen't mean that you hate it just because of it's name. You should at least participate seagoing cowboys once.

People might not have many reasons to support there statement about "Why you shouldn't be a Seagoing Cowboy'', but I have at least some reasons as why you should join the program.

One of my many reasons is if you love working with animals then your up for the job. Many of the "Seagoing Cowboys" had to take care of the Horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On pharagraph two it states "UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that weree shippes overseas."

If you were to join the cowboys you will have to be able to go away from your family for a while. For example, on paragraph three it states "In Augest 1945", and on paragraph four it states "By the time he was discharged in 1947", what I'am trying to do is prove my point. Since you have to be away from your family, you won't be able to see your family in about three years. If you can go three years without seeing your familly then you have forund your job.

Besides helping people, you are able to see awsome sighting and go to places that you've never been before. You are able to go and see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Crete, Panama, and you could go to Italy. On paragragh five it states " Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special," he says "So was taking a gondola ride in Vencie, Italy, a city with streets of water."

Luke also toured an excaveted castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his was to China.

So, in conclusion I belive that you can, and should join the Sesagoing Cowboys. Only if you are able to parcipitate very well, and if you won't have a problem with all of those things you have to do.
