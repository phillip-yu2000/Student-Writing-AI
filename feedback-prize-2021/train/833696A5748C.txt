I think that the principle shouldn't change the school policy because if you a C average your still passing all your classes and people should play sports and join other activities if they are passing their classes. If many of the students have grade C average who will join the sports to represent and play for their school. Many of the all star players in the schools do not have a grade B average and their making the team win a lot and that will help the school a lot. For school activities like dancing or math club, if they do not have a grade B average who will go dance for the competitions. For other activities like the math club, they will be passing their math but what if their failing their other classes, that wont make them have a grade B average. If they don't have a grade B average who will go to compete at the math competitions. Maybe their best mathematician failed other classes and he wont be there, the school just lost their biggest advantage. This policy just makes me go crazy and mad because most kids don't have B averages and A averages a lot of people that ADHD or dyslexia need help and cant have a B average but they might be the best football, basketball or baseball player the school has. Orchestra and band players compete a lot in UIL or other competitions they even go out of the state to go compete. If their best trumpet or saxophone player is not passing and he doesn't go their school just automatically lost the first place and for orchestra if they don't have their best violin or bass player their school lost first place. I just hope that you do not change this policy, principle of the school.
