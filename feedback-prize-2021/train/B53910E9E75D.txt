Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME;

I am representing the athletic people in SCHOOL_NAME that like sports, but also only have a C average. I am strongly against the new change in policy towards the change of the GPA of being able to play. If you bring up the grades the schools team sports will lose good team athletes that are half way decent in the class room, but are exceptional on the field.

Yes there are a majority of students that have B averages but even though they do the percent of them don't make up most of the teams. The teams have different people on them that work in different ways. Yes some kids and parents could argue that the athletes should be smart and well educated, but what they don't say is that the kids should have fun and do what they like to do. Students that can get a middle course grade (a, b, C, d and f) should be able to go out after school and have a fun, disciplined time with their coaches and team mates.

School shouldn't become a place where students don't want to learn and it will become that way if you take away sports for most. I am one that if you raise that average i will change schools because that would make an unfair competition because other schools will have certain students that are phenomenal at sports that have a just above a C average. That would be very unfair because we would lose our talent!

Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this and I hope you DO NOT Raise the average and keep it where it is.

Sincerely;

STUDENT_NAME
