I believe that students at any school should but should not have the right to use their phones during any free time that they have and should not allow them to be seen during school at anytime. Phones cause can cause a lot of disruption and problems while using them at school. But, they could also be good for emergencies.

Some reasons how phone the can cause disruption is by going off in class during any kind of important event. They also can cause problems if something bad was going on like a lock down or something it would make noise and that might cause someone to get hurt. Phones would keep the students off task and keep them something focused on the phones instead of what is being said or what is suppose to be happing.

Now I'm not saying that it would all be bad because phone could be a good use of resource sometimes. They would be needed for if something was wrong like if the school was on fire and you didn't have any thing to use you would need your phone. Even like if your mom or someone important was calling you at school to tell you something important it would be needed.

Phones can still be bad for school because if there was a problem or fight is about to happen the student(s) could call others up there and that up cause a huge problem and put everyone in danger.

Now, as you can see this is why I wouldn't or would allow phones to be used during school.
