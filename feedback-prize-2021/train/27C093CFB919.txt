Have you ever been through a tough time? A death in the family, a bad athletic performance in your last sporting event, maybe you and your spouse just ended a lengthy relationship. Hard times, and the feelings that come with them should not be spread out for your peers to see. I disagree with the Facial Action Coding System. Kids and young adults should be able to hide their emotions becuase not everyone deserves to know how they feel.

Everyone has different feelings. Some negative, some posotive. If you are in class and your mom calls informing you that a loved one has been seriously injured and they are in critical condition, the feelings you have at that moment belong to you and only you. If you are in class and the coding system says that you are feeling 90 percent sad and 10 percent fearful, your classmates are ging to attack you with questions that could possibly worsen your mental state.

I understand that the system could increase test scores and grade averages, but the one thing that means the most is your security. Teachers' lives would be much easier due to the fact that they know which students need help and which students are soaking up the lesson well. There is just one problem. People (especially the youth) are insocure. Privacy is very important in this world and I believe the Facial Action Coding System would snatch that away from us.

All in all, there are pros and cons when discussing the coding system. More cons than pros in my opinion. The idea of feelings being released for everyone to see is too risky. If we unleash the beast into schools around the world, things could flip upside down.
