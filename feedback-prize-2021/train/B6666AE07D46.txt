Dear principal,

I feel that not participating in sports or other sports or activities because you a B average is not fair. The reasons i think this isn't fair is because some kids may not can help what kinds of grades they make, some kids may have better learning abilities than others, and lastly kids may take harder classes than other children. These are the reasons why I wouldn't agree with the idea of not being able to be in sports or other activities just because of a C average.

The first reason I wouldn't agree with this change is because some children can't help what kinds of grades they make. Kids have learning disabilities and can't help what they go through. They have a harder time doing their work and concentrating on what their mind should be on.

This is just one of the reasons why I think this change is unfair.

The second reason I think this change is unfair is because some children have learning disabilities. I know many kids in my school that have learning disabilities and have to be set aside form our other classmates just to get the right grades and help they need. Some children have ADD and can't help that. It would be very unfair for you to take away a privilege if the child can't help their learning disability.

The last reason it I also think this is unfair is because some children take harder classes than others. When another child takes harder classes what grades they make, it is just the best they can do. For an example kids may take pre algebra when, others take algebra 1.

This is the final reason why i think this is unfair to the students.

I have just gave you my opinion about taking away sports and activities.

I hope you can better understand why this is a bad change for our school. Learning abilities,

harder classes, and some children can't help what grades they make are just a few reasons why I think this is a bad change for our school.
