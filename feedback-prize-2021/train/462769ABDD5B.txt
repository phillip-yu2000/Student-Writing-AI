My opinion about performing a community service is that they should have a community service. i think that they should have that because the a community service gives a help to the community because helping out in the community is very good and could give a good help to residents in the community because some communities have old people or even paralised person which can't help out in the community. So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community. I think those students who say community service takes too much time they should just give some time when they are just sitting their in the couch and go help out your community and the environment.
