Have you ever needed advice but didnt know who to talk to. I know i have. Sometimes i would read a book seeking for the advice that i needed but couldnt find it. I've always wanted to talk to someone for advice but didnt know who.

When seeking for advice it could be very confusing because who would you talk to,where would you go. Would talking to a stranger be weird? maybe because you dont know them or their intentions. If you cant get good advice talk to your family they may have great advice or may know someone who can help.

Talking to multiple people for advice is also a great way to get advice,they'll provide you with different advice and mind sets. Having different advice and opinions can help you make better choices. In conclusion, when your seeking for advice dont just talk to one person talk to multiple so you can have different options. By doing so you can make a better choice for your self and others around you.
