Do you think this "face" was created by aliens? I think not because this "face" was not created by aliens but created by a natural landform. Landforms happen all the time, just because it happend on another planet doesn't mean aliens did it.

In the article NASA unveiled the picture for all to see and THEY captioned it "huge rock formation" . Which basicly means even NASA doen't think it was aliens who created it. Also after the articles states what NASA captioned the picture, it says "formed by shadows giving the ALLUSION of eyes, nose, and mouth." Its just an allusion not even a face really.

Also, the aticle says "there was no alien monument arter all." if NASA really believed aliens did that I don't think NASA would release it to the world. I'm sure the government is strict on them on releasing things to the public. NASA probably wanted people to pay attention to them so they can have their one minute fame. Skeptics think alien marking were hidden by haze. Come on really, all the great technology NASA has and you think it was hidden behind clouds.

The technology they have is great. When they finally got a clear shot to take a picture, they took it. After they took it, they zoomed in three times bigger... nothing. NASA said if there were any small shacks or evidence of aircraft you would have seen what they were. Marvin, from NASA says it reminded him of landforms created on Earth, so if an expert that works at NASA

thinks that it was created by a landform, then why do we think it was an alien or aliens that created it?

In conclusion, the "face" was not created by an aliens or aliens, but was just created by a landform.
