Have you ever wondered about the Seagoing Cowboys? I would love to join the Seagoing Cowboys because you get to take care of animals such as horses, young cows, and mules that are shipped overseas. The Seagoing Cowboys is alot of fun because on the way back you get to play fun games like Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whttling, and more games.

You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you would have alot of fun and traveling. When you go to places you have never visited before its alot of fun like going to Europe, China, and Greece. You get to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean there you will get to see whales and dolphines swimming in the ocean.

You will have some bumps and bruises along the way but I bet you can fight through it like Luke and Don did. I also bet you will have as much fun as them too and get to know what more places feel like.
