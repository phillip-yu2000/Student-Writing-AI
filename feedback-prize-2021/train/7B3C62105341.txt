Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you to discuss to you about your new plan about not allowing students to participate in any sports unless they have a B average. Honestly I have to say that I like but at the same time dislike the idea. I like the idea because if a student in the school knows they are failing school and they play basketball but they cant play because they are failing they would try to bump up they're grades so that they can play basketball and also that would be good for the school if everyone had a B average. I dislike the idea because some students aren't as smart as others and getting a B would be very hard for them to achieve. What I am trying to tell you is to reconsider the idea before putting it into effect. Take some time to think about what ideas. You have to look at this from both ways/sides.

In conclusion all I have to say is that I am glad that you are our new principal. You are doing an excellent job and keep up the good work.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME
