The technology is very valuable. It's actually quite amazing how something like that can pick up on peoples emotions. There so many ways that something like that could be very useful. Say such a teacher teaching in a college. It's hard to give all your attention to one student's confusion on something. It'd also be hard to be able to see if every student is paying attention and staying on task. But with this technology, it could help change that.

There are many ways that could change that, and that the fact is, it wouldnt take long for the computer to realize soemthing is wrong. A way it could help change that, is the teacher could easily switch on the topic he's speaking on. Most students when it's something they're not intersted in, seem to zone out and lose foucs. But if the teacher knew that most students felt that way, there's ways he could bring in something that they'd enjoy. Another way the computer could help is the teaching methods. It said in paragraph one, that they're wanting to make computre and human talking easier. One way is having a one one review, talk, or lesson. The Facial Action Coding System could easily pick up on when the student is lost or needs help.
