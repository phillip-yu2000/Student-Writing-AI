In this passage we see Luke's experience as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke shows us how being a Seagoing Cowboy gave him awareness for other people. He also shows us the many impotant things to learn from this job.

First, while being a Seagoing Cowboy Luke learned to take care of many of the animals.

He fed them and gave them water.

These actions, in turn, helped many people that were suffering.

Second, caring for the animals taught Luke to be responsible and to be a hard worker.

In the passage Luke said he had to make sure he fed the animals, give them water every day, and clean the stalls.

He also said ha had to be a night guard and check on the animals every hour to make sure everything was okay.

Next, other than taking care of the animals and doing different work, Luke also got to see new things and have fun.

He said he saw China, Europe, the Acropolis in Greece, an excavated castle in Crete,and the Panama Canal.

He also went on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy.

Even on the boat Luke had fun.

He and the other cowboys played baseball and volleyball games, had tournaments, and did other enjoyable things.

Finally, Luke saw people that were hurting and that needed his help.

Luke said '' I'm grateful for the opportunity,'' and that '' It made me more aware of people...''

Because of the Seagoing Cowboys program, Luke helped many others, even after he was discharged from the program.

The Seagoing Cowboys program was a eye opening adventure for Luke.

It can also be a life changing experience for other people too.

They can learn lessons and help people just like Luke did.

It may also change their outlook on life. They may want to do more to help others in need, rather than just helping themselves.
