Dear, TEACHER_NAME i believe that students of SCHOOL_NAME should be able to join the sports time with at least have an c average. my first reason on why i think that is because some students need's things to do after school. my second reason is that NOT all students can make an B average unless they really try. picture this one student by the name of drew brees enters SCHOOL_NAME he was the best qouiter back that ever stepped foot on SCHOOL_NAME he proudly walked up to the sign up sheet to sign up for the SCHOOL_NAME foot ball team but they quickly turned him away because he had an c average and an high one at that. that was the only thing drew had to do after school. this is why they atleast need an C average to attend sports and activities. my second reason was that some students cant really get an B average unless they tried. imagine this Sabrina was an student who only mad straight C on her reports card but she wanted to sign up for the step time they turned her away because she made straight C even though she tried. these are my reasons why i think students should atleast get an C average to get into any sports or any activates.
