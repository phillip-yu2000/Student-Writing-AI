Dear, Principal

Hey, i just want to tell you that you should choose the first policy because for that i doubt that any teachers would sent students to the office. Its a great idea , and most students wont have to be hidden there phones from the teachers and other staffs . I think if policy one was in our rules most of us would do better , and wont pay attention to there phones as much because they know in a certain time im going to be able to look at my messages or what ever mail you have . Another reason its a good idea because there be less arguing , teachers would stop yelling at the students to put there phone away . If this ever happen it would be good because most of us cant live with out a phone , like me . Last, cellphones work for when people have to call home , instead of using the office phone they can just wait till the period to use phones and call and tell them what they got to say . Also, when we have free time instead of thinking on doing something stupid , we'll just take out our phones and just chill . Well your a good principal and hope you do the right decision . I really think it will change a lot of students in a lot of ways . Well i have to go, talk to you later and see you at school tomorrow . Have a wonderful day.

Sincerely STUDENT_NAME .
