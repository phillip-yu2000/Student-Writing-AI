Schools are always going to find different ways to excel in student learning.

The schools are going to give out summer projects to the students to help them learn while they are on summer break.

The summer project should be designed by the teachers because students would learn more from teacher designed projects and so that the students dont pick a topic for their project that they have already learned about.

The students would learn alot more if the teachers were to design the projects.

The teachers have a better understanding of how to design the projects.

The students may have a hard time designing the project with out the teachers help.

The teacher overall has way more experience to design the project than the students would. Teachers could utilize all class topics on the summer project for students to pick.

They have all the topics utilized so that they can assure that the students will learned something over the summer.

The students will be able to learn all the topics over the summer with the teacher designed project.

The teacher designed project would be better so that the students do not pick an irrelevent topic or a poor project outline.

If the teachers let the students design the project then the sudents may choose a topic unrelated to the class.

The project would not be teaching the students what they need to learn.

The student may also create a poor project outline.

The poor outline would be unacceptable and would not be able to grade.

the poor outline would keep the student from learning important information on the topic.

If the schools pick the teacher designed project it will be better for the students because the students would learn more from it and so the students dont pick an irrelevant topic. The teacher designed project will help students succeed and provide them with better learning experiences.
