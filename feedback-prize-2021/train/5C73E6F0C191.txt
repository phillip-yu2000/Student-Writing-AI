There's a lot of these students in this school that have a cell phone. There's a lot of student who text during classes and call people during class to be funny or talk to their friend when there right next to them. I think we should have Policy 2. We should have only kids use them during free periods and in lunch hours. The students don't realize the privilege's they have in this school year.

I strongly believe we should have policy two. We should have that policy because the students use their phones during class and that distracts them a lot. It distracts them because the teacher is teaching the class and a phone ring out of nowhere all the kids are going to look at the person and start laughing at him or her. What if a students is texting and it falls out of their pocket and breaks then the kids are going to stare at him or her and laugh. Then the kid is going to feel embarrassed.

Another reason why the kids are going to get distracted is because their not going to understand what the teacher is talking about and their going to fail that next test or fail the marking period because their always on their phone in class.

Another reason why i think the students should not have phones in school is because a lot of students also like to pay attention in class. If a student is hearing noise from the other students phone because their were texting a lot its going to get pretty annoying. I know the feeling. There's a girl in my class who is always texting her friend in class. I always hear the vibration on her desk. I always yell at her and she always starts laughing in my face. I hate it and I don't like when i' am trying to do my work all I hear is noise coming from her phone. Well all I am saying is don't let the students have phones in school they will get distracted easily.
