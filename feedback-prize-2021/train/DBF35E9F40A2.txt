I think students should not get the benefit on taking online classes from home.

My reason why I say that is because I feel like they're going to be easily distracted. I say that because most kids gets easily distracted in school right now. Due to phone and not turning in work on time being the time given to them . So I don't think that time the student gets home he/she is going to do the work. Beacause they're going to think of it like this.

They have 24hrs to get a couple of online/video classes done in the mean time they have only 8hrs in school to get the work done. Well at least I know I wouldve thought of it that way.

But you know some students think different about things like this some students might want get it done then and there. Not waste any other free time they may get to do any work. Like some students might take this as an advantage and get as much work done as possible so they have the extra free time other days.

And some students have jobs they might want to get they're work done in the morning and go to work come home and not have any work to do when they come home

But as I said in the first paragraph I would've thought of it different then any other scholar/students.

As an example; If I were to go on vacation and only have online classes I would get the work out of the way so i could have more fun on the vacation.

But I guess all I am really trying to say is it could really be a big debate. About if schools should offer any online classes to students or not.

So in conclusion I dont think students should have the option of getting any online/video classes.
