Dear state senator with all do respect I feel like electoral college is unfair. Why you may ask? because in reality us the U.S citizens aren't getting to actually vote directly for who we want. for example in paragraph 10 in the second source it is stated that the way that college electoral voting works is by letteing the people vote for representatives that represent the actual candidate. In other words lets say that more than 100 people vote for a certain candidate well those 100 peoples vote will not all be counted because that particular candidate may only have 37 representatives.

in addition that makes our votes less valuable! The voting method should actually change to popular vote, because that way it is equal or even and no one is being left out and every persons vote counts. Also the popular vote for president of the U.S is better because in that case there is more possibilities of candidates to last either longer or even have a better opportunity in being elected as president.

The whole point of having popular vote is so that us the citizens feel equal and also free because this is a free state and the whole meaning of this nation was that we the citizens get to pick our president. Another thing why I feel like popular vote is more better is because it would make the governments job so much easier. For example all they would have to do is collect votes and see who has the most. Instead of having to know that the votings are unfair with college electoral voting..

These were my reasons why I feel like popular voting for a president is a much more better choice than college electoral voting.
