I think students should be required to do community service. Its a great way to appreciate the Earth, but also a good way to teach. For example, some students may like to go outside and get involved. Its a new experience of studying. Personally i love doing hands-on work, such as projects and building things.

The advantages are helping the planet and doing things for others. It makes an individual feel like they achieved something, it makes them feel good and have courage. community service is a great way to learn. You can get more involved, outside of school. You can get to know your neighbors or, who knows, you may just be a natural and open a window to a new career you never would think of. It'll give us knowledge that may be necessary in the future! Students should always keep an opened mind and take risks. Even if they don't like "helping", they should at least try it out. They wont know it, until they try it!

Now there are only a few flaws with this. For one, if its winter and you go outside, students may not like the cold weather (not likely), or maybe some students would not like the subject, or idea, of actually getting up, working and moving. Some may think its too boring or they don't want to tutor children. Doing community service may take time away from doing homework or take time away from activities we do outside of school

Overall, it depends on the person if they volunteer to help their community. But, I think its a great idea and we should do it. It'll be a new experience that'll somehow make me wiser and apply that knowledge later on in life.
