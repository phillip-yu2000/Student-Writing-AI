From what I've read, I believe that the Face is a natural landform. There are three reasons that I think this, and I'll explain them all in this essay.

My first reason for believing the Face is a natural landform is that if NASA knew anything about aliens or artifacts, then they would probably tell us. In paragraph 5, the author states, "defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars." It's their job, and they would get paid more if they discovered something about aliens.

My next reason is that even if the first photo taken of the Face looked like an alien artifact, the second photo proved that wrong by having a much higher quality.. According to the author in paragraph 11, "if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were," which proves that the Face isn't an alien structure or artifact.

My last reason is that the Face is a mesa, just like the kind we have on Earth. In paragraph 12, the text states, "What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West," showing how the Face is just a normal landform with strange shadows.

In conclusion, there are probably many other arguments that prove that the Face is just a natural landform, but the reasons above are the most convincing ones I found in this article.
