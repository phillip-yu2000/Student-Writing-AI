"Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."

The author supports the idea of exploring Venus. The author shows many intrests the planet but also in the technology used to explore it, from "Venus being earths twin" and "possibly supported life with large oceans long ago" to "mechanical computers" that can potentially last in the harsh environment. The author also wants to know the options for making this mission both "safe and scientifically productive". One of NASA's possible solutions is to allow scientist to float about 30 or more miles above the land to avoid most of the storms and the harsh ground conditions, The conditions will still be rough with tempratures of 170 degrees fahrenheit but the pressure would be close to the same pressure of earths sea level.

In conclusion Venus may be a hard planet to study but our scientist are working hard on many solutions to traveling to that harsh planet.
