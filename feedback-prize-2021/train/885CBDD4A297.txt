Have you ever asked somebody for their opinion so you can make a choice? Most people ask more than one person and if you're one of those people that's a good thing. Asking only one person for an opinion is not really a bad thing, but that person you're asking might not tell you everything you need to know. Looking for multiple opinions rather than one is better because some people know more then others and you get more information to base your choice off of.

When you're asking somebody for their opinion it's better to ask multiple people because some know more then others. There are some people that will give you a basic four word response because they don't know anything about what you're asking them about. However others have more knowledge or experience. Those people will give you a long response to your question with more information and advice about the choice you're going to make. An example would be buying something and you didn't know if you are getting your money's worth. You could ask different people to see if you're getting a good deal or if you could buy something for the same quality for a lower price somewhere else.

Getting multiple opinions also gives you more information to base your choice off of. If you have more information it will make it easier for you to choose, or it will give you alot more options to choose from. You could put together all the information you got from asking multiple people to help make a better choice for yourself. This relates to me because it helped me pick out a dog when I was younger. It made it easier for me to choose a dog that would be perfect for my lifestyle.

Looking for multiple opinions rather than one is better because some people know more then others, you get more information to base your choice off of. The next time you have a hard time making a choice try asking alot of people for some advice. It gives you more information, and it helps you make a better choice for yourself.
