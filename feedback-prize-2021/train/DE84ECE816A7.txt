When people ask for different opinions, it is so they can see what peoples views are. People ask for advice all the time, but sticking to one persons views isnt always the best way to get the best information. This is why people ask for different views or opinions when seeking advice.

When going out for information, asking people is one of the best ways to get it. Instead of looking something up or searching in a book, we can ask our peers or anyone. The bad thing about this is everyone has opinions. Having your own opinion is very common but when it comes to ask someone about something their opinions may differ from others. Our opinion may be the opposite of theirs and we may not agree on it. Which is why asking for multiple opinions are important.

When talking to people they will give out their opinion. Their opinion is important because we can see why he or she thinks that way. With their opinion we can use that opinion and reasoning to better help us find better advice. Instead of talking to one person and getting a single opinion which may be biased.

It is better to ask for multiple opinions when getting advice so you can find different views and better answers, so you get as much information as possible. Talking with multiple people is just a better way to figure something out.
